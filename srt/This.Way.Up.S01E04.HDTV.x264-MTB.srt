1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,090
- Look at their T-shirts.
- Slag party.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,750
Wish you'd let me organise
you a slag party, Shona.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,830
- Every day's a slag party to you.
- Ha! Hey!

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,670
Good joke. Come here, did you get
something for Vish's dad for us?

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,030
- Did you see me get anything?
- No. We'll get something from the shop.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,190
Course I got him something and
a card and signed it from us.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,630
Gotten all nervy.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,510
You said you didn't care if Mam met them.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,390
Not about Mammy meeting Vish's
family, about you and Ma.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,390
- You haven't talked to her in months.
- Oh, Shona, don't.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,030
No, come on, she's old.
You have to forgive her.

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,590
- Move on. - She's only
old when she wants to be.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,590
- What if she died?
- Mammy won't die. She's too stubborn.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,870
Can't believe I said
that about Mammy dying.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,510
We're too different,
we'll never get along.

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,230
You'll never get along?
You always got along.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,350
- Look, they've gone, free slag mags.
- Grab me one.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,270
I'll tell you what the problem is.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,430
I'm stuck in the middle of this
bullshit and it's not fair.

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,030
Hey, Sho, Sho, look at this.

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,590
We will fight them on the beaches.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,870
W-we will fight them on the grass!

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,710
Then we will come back to the
beaches for more beach fighting.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,750
My babies!

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,150
- What happened to your leg?
- What happened to you?

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,310
Don't point it out or people
will notice. It's grand.

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,030
- You have a cane. You look mad.
- No, it's not a cane.

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,070
I only have it in case my
sports injury starts playing up.

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,360
Oh, God.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,070
God, your hair's got so long!

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,270
You look like your father in the 70s!

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,070
So I look like a dead man? Thanks.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,280
Here. Who's this?

34
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,750
It's Uncle Terry!

35
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,710
Mammy, stop now.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,350
No silliness, this is a big day for
Shona. We'll be late for our train.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,920
Oh, come on.

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,790
What's in this, Mammy? Jesus.

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,510
Just a few bricks. A little bit
of gold bullion in my knickers.

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,270
Do you know what, it's a bit of
a way off. Shall we get a taxi?

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,350
Yes, please.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,950
Shona, don't be gentle with
me like I'm an old one.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,950
It's just my hamstring, I'm fine.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,950
We'll put you in a wheelchair
and roll you down the hill.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,750
Do you know what you're like,
you're like Willy Wonka --

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,350
- Willy Wonka. - Let me finish.
And The Chocolate Factory.

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,230
I wasn't interrupting,
that's how conversations work.

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,030
And anyway, the film is called Willy Wonka

49
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,750
but the book is called Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory.

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,230
- You used to read me that.
- No, it's the opposite way around.

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,430
- Now. - What? - How come you're
allowed to interrupt but I'm not?

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,270
Because that's different
than interrupting a joke.

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,990
- You let someone get to the end of --
- It was a joke, was it?

54
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,390
- Yes. It would have made Shona laugh.
- Go on, the pair of yous!

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,040
Oh, God.

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,000
Wait, Richard the French
boy's dad will love this.

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,310
- What are you doing?
- Taking a picture of these coffee pods. Funny.

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,750
He says people recycle
them but no one ever does.

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,110
Who's Richard? You never told
me there was a man on the go.

60
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,430
- Oh, Mammy! - Well, Mammy,
Richard is Aine's elderly lover.

61
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,750
- Oh, elderly lover?
- He's the same age as Shona!

62
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,390
Do you think he might want
a go on the mother too?

63
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,910
- Oh! - Well, when I put my cane
down I could give it a good go.

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,720
Bleurgh! Disgusting!

65
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, girls.

66
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,470
Get off, get off, it was a joke!

67
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,390
I was being Willy Wonka!

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,430
Well, it's a joke if
you know how to do it.

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,990
You've no sense of humour.

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,950
I would have laughed so hard if it
backfired and you fell right on your face.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,430
Anyways, that's not how you do a fall. It's
all in the feet. This is how you do a fall.

72
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,950
Like... Whoa!

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,270
- Like that.
- That was really fake.

74
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,070
I knew you were going to do that.

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,670
You knew because I told
you I was gonna do it.

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,030
Answer for everything. All
right, show me a back flip now.

77
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,670
I watched a YouTube clip
so don't be sarcastic.

78
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,550
Let's get a taxi, seriously.
Let's just get a taxi.

79
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,990
- Don't talk about curry or Bollywood.
- I could have worked in Bollywood.

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,270
I went for a casting for a music
video they made in Dublin once.

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,070
Who were they? All the Bollywoods?
Paul Bollywood and his friends?

82
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,390
There was an Indian gentleman we
interviewed one time for Nationwide.

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,350
Lovely man. Lived in Nice.

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,480
Er... Don't mention that. I
don't know why, just don't.

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,390
- And don't talk about marriage or...
- Yeah, Mam.

86
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,190
- I was talking to you. - What? - Ah.

87
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,750
Hi!

88
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,510
Come in, come in.

89
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,190
Hello! Hello!

90
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,270
- Happy birthday, Hari.
- Hello, how are you?

91
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,030
That's for you from all of us.

92
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,750
Today's not about me, I
don't want to make a fuss.

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,390
Oh, there she is! I just
wanted to meet the big star.

94
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,150
Oh no! No, just treat
me like a normal person.

95
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,560
What a lovely house you've got.

96
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,190
Hi, I'm your slave for today.

97
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,150
I don't get to eat never mind
that I'm on a zero hours contract.

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,430
- But would you like one of these?
- Tell me, what's in this one?

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,470
Mam, they're grand, you'll like them.

100
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,470
- I was only asking.
- Nothing is too spicy, Eileen.

101
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,270
We learnt our lesson from
the last time Aine was here.

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,550
It wasn't too spicy for me,
something just got stuck in my neck.

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,880
- Spice.
- She is very sensitive.

104
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,430
This is demeaning on so many levels.

105
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,430
If you got a proper job you could
have a spot at the big boys' table.

106
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,670
I have a proper job at BuzzFeed.

107
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,550
Oh, Bubs, you know what,

108
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,390
when you go to school and study hard
you could have a job at BuzzFeed.

109
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,400
Or you can do what Uncle Vish did and move to
New York for two minutes and sound like a shit

110
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,350
radio DJ.

111
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,630
Whoa, whoa, radio DJ!

112
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,350
It was 12 years, it wasn't two minutes.

113
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,350
Happy birthday to you, Dad.

114
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't make a fuss, huh?

115
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,350
- You'll make him cry.
- All right, everyone, listen up. Shh.

116
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,670
I just want to say how wonderful it
is to have you here with us today.

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,350
And to celebrate we have
prepared a special dish for Aine.

118
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,510
Oh, that's so nice.

119
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,880
Ta da!

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,480
Very funny. Oh, my God, thank you so
much. Is this all the way from Kerala?

121
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,870
- No. Too spicy.
- Would you like yogurt with that?

122
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,270
Can I get some yoghurt, please? Thank you.

123
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,350
What you up to right now, Sho?

124
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,350
I haven't told you about Sho's new thing?

125
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,350
- You're gonna love this as a woman.
- As a woman who also has a job.

126
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,630
Listen up... working woman.

127
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,630
No, it is very good, Sho is doing this
networking thing for women in finance.

128
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,910
- Oh, wow, that's amazing.
- Yes, it is very exciting.

129
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,910
It's a big project. I'm setting it
up for this amazing woman who's...

130
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,310
- She's doing most of the work.
- She's more amazing.

131
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,230
- Oh, that's amazing!
- Is it a big job, Shona?

132
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,630
Mm. Yeah.

133
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,030
It's small right now but hopefully
over the next couple of years.

134
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,590
It'll be hard with the
children then, won't it?

135
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,310
- Mum!
- Well, what?

136
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,470
Time must be a pressure at this stage.

137
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,030
Oh, yes, none of us getting
any younger, Kavita.

138
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,150
Well, Shona doesn't have time
for kids cos she's got me.

139
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,950
Well, you definitely have become
a full-time job this last year.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,560
What was last year?

141
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,470
Er, she broke her leg.

142
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,190
- Oh, no! What did you do? - Yeah.
- It's all fixed now. She's fine.

143
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,070
That's bad luck that
you both have bad legs.

144
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,430
That's where the similarity ends, Seema.

145
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,910
Actually, I once auditioned
for the film My Left Foot.

146
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,190
- Wowee! - What did you
audition for, the right foot?

147
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,190
No!

148
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,750
For a neighbour who comes in.

149
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,670
The neighbour, I think I saw that bit!

150
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,710
- Did you? - She didn't
get the part. Chill out.

151
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,320
I actually don't want kids.

152
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,230
You always think you don't want
kids and then you change your mind.

153
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,550
I mean, I still sometimes
think I don't want Aine.

154
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,630
But genuinely, I genuinely
don't, you know?

155
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,720
It's not a big deal. Just never have.

156
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,790
Do you know what, lads, I'm going
to throw caution to the wind

157
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,550
and eat with my hand!

158
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,440
Yeah, so fork off, forks.

159
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,870
What about you and children, Vish?

160
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,350
- Oh, erm, I want what Shona wants.
- Oh, OK.

161
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,710
What about when you're our age? Who'll
look after you in the care home?

162
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,630
- I thought you wanted kids, Vish.
- No, I er... I have Bubs right here.

163
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,470
And she is all I need and then
give her back to you when I'm done.

164
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,750
- You never know real love
until you have children. - Mam!

165
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,030
Even if Anil murdered someone I'd
still love him unconditionally.

166
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,110
And get a spade to dig a
grave and cover it up.

167
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,070
- Why am I a murderer?
- Vish'd never murder someone.

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,750
Yeah, I'm a pyro guy.

169
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,070
- Let me take her back.
- No, she's fine.

170
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,830
I don't think you need to be a
mother to know unconditional love.

171
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,830
Don't think that's a thing.

172
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,830
Also I have enough money to hire
someone to visit me in a care home so...

173
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Do you know what, I'm just gonna make
a call, I'll be back in a second.

174
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,070
- This is new.
- Huh?

175
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,670
Oh, shit, I didn't mean to FaceTime you!

176
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,430
- Shall I call you back normally?
- It's OK. It's nice.

177
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,670
It's nice to see your face. Are you OK?

178
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,030
Yeah. I just literally saw a
picture of Vish and his ex-wife

179
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,110
in a frame in his parents' kitchen.

180
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,030
Oh, God, why do they still have that?

181
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,040
- No idea.
- Can I see it?

182
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,280
Oh, she's an angry little elf.

183
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,550
Yeah, er... It's thrown me a bit, sorry.

184
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,520
Long day. Erm...

185
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,270
Listen, I don't know if
this is a good time but --

186
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,470
- Sorry, Shona.
- It's OK.

187
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,070
I-I'll let you go. We can talk later.

188
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,190
Yeah, OK. All right, I'll call you back.

189
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,030
Shona, you know we don't
care if you have children.

190
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,590
Oh, no, no, it's not that. It's erm...

191
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,570
Oh, that's embarrassing.

192
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,510
No, it's fine, I get it. I mean,
it was his first marriage, it's...

193
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,320
Shona, we just like the
frame, that is why we have it.

194
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,710
- Really? - Genuinely, and that
woman was a complete idiot.

195
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,230
She thought France was
the capital of France.

196
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,800
Did she?

197
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,110
I've taken some really
nice pictures of you today.

198
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,870
I'm going to put you in it instead.

199
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,270
Oh no, you don't need
to put me in a frame.

200
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,950
I mean, it's a very nice frame.

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,510
I want you to help me choose
because I always get this wrong.

202
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,040
The women always get annoyed when I put
their picture on Instagram without editing.

203
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,110
All they want is a Valencia
filter and no smiling.

204
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,360
Wouldn't be the worst.

205
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,880
Sorry. They're awful.

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,670
Oh! So the sun is actually boiling
up the worm? That's disgusting.

207
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,910
Poor little wormie, he
needs to get inside.

208
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,750
- He's got no way because...
- Any reply from the old boy?

209
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,550
I'm not waiting for a reply from old
boy. What was that about the worm?

210
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,200
The worm crawled up...

211
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,240
- Isn't that nice?
- Mm.

212
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,030
He's a real softie, isn't he?

213
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,830
- Our Shona always loved
being round her dad. - Mm.

214
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,590
- What's he doing? Is he
flirting with you? - Yeah.

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,150
Really nice to see you.
You'll never get rid of us.

306
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,590
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Thank you. The food was delicious.

307
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,470
Where's your coat?

308
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,110
- I'm gonna stay here for a bit so you
two head back together, yeah? - What?

309
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,470
I'll bring your bag. Aine
has my key to let you in.

310
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,510
Er... But h-how will we
find the train station?

311
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,830
- We'll be grand if you draw us a map.
- No, you'll be grand

312
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,190
because you have phones and
you're not five years old.

313
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,550
- Right. - Right. - Bye,
see you back at your place.

314
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,270
- Love you.
- Love you too.

315
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,880
I really do.

316
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,310
- It's been lovely.
- Are you pissed off with me?

317
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,470
- I'm not pissed off with you.
- No tears, hmm?

318
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,020
- Thank you for a lovely day.
- Bye!

319
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,910
Your singing was really good.

320
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,350
Shouldn't have said to
Shona about having kids.

321
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,390
You shouldn't have been so narky
cos some old fella never texted you.

322
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,560
I work for him so just try and hurry
up, we're gonna miss this train.

323
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,430
Excuse me, that's my mother!

324
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
- Sorry.
- She's disabled. Jesus!

325
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,000
- Sorry.
- Christ!

326
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,000
Mam, stop, you all right?

327
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,190
And you did love coming to set with me.

328
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,350
All those things I did. Like
wearing those stupid hats.

329
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,590
That's what paid for your drama
classes and Shona's riding lessons

330
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,470
- and all those Ad-eedas shoes.
- Adidas.

331
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,320
Adidas shoes.

332
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,030
I was just trying to do my best.

333
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,510
Yeah, well, your best
didn't work cos look at me.

334
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,590
Why you so angry all the time?

335
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,590
- What have I done? I didn't do anything.
- Exactly, Mammy! Exactly!

336
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,990
- You didn't do anything.
- What are you on about?

337
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,190
- You didn't come and get me.
- Come and get you? - Yes.

338
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,470
What?

339
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,470
I wanted you to come and get me, Mammy.

340
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,830
I wanted you to come down to that
place and take me out of there.

341
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,470
And take me home and make me better.

342
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,710
Those people in there
knew what they were doing.

343
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,150
What help would I have been?

344
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,320
You're my mammy, that's why!

345
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,830
I just wanted you to try.

346
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,990
Instead of all this... all this pretence,

347
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,310
like I'm fine, like everything's
fine, like it's grand.

348
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,110
- Like she broke her leg.
- That's what you told me to say.

349
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,320
Only to family if they
asked me where I was.

350
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,510
I was so alone, Mammy. You've no idea.

351
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,790
- Oh, I have an idea, believe
you me. I know. - Oh, really?

352
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,200
- Oh yeah, what, was bingo difficult
one night? - I bloody know.

353
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,950
I left Shona. When she
was born, I left her.

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,240
For three months I left her
because... I didn't want her.

355
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,560
Mam.

356
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,280
I just... I just couldn't.

357
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,040
I'm sorry, Mam.

358
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,070
- But you are brilliant.
- Oh... - You are.

359
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,240
And why wouldn't you be
brilliant? You're my daughter.

360
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,550
I just want you to find someone
who'll make you see that.

361
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,950
Mammy, a man isn't gonna fix me.

362
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,480
No.

363
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,680
- Bit of sex'd be nice.
- Oh, God, yuck, don't.

364
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,550
Oh and if you tell Shona
I left her I'll kill you.

365
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,870
And...

366
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,670
Well, could you just ring me sometimes.

367
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,710
You have to work out how to use
FaceTime. The top of your head --

368
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,910
It's very lonely, Aine.

369
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,920
Most of my friends, half of them are dead.

370
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,840
Did you kill them?

371
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,350
Only Louise Gallagher because
she was so fucking annoying!

372
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,910
- Oh, my God, Mammy, he texted back.
- Go on, what did he say?

373
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,680
Wait a minute.

374
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,870
"Ha ha."

375
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,070
That's a bit of an anticlimax.

376
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,430
Jesus.

377
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,110
You have to be careful with
men. They don't always get jokes.

378
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,750
No.

379
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,590
Also annoyingly Shona didn't
get us return tickets.

380
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,510
- What?
- Don't worry, I'll get them.

381
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,070
No, I'm getting the tickets.

382
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,150
- No, you're disabled so it'll be half price.
- I am not disabled.

383
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,160
I am getting both tickets and
they will both be full fares.
