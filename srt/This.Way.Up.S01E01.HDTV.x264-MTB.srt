1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,990
- And there's your receipt.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,470
It just... Erm...

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,870
Right. So, erm...

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,910
Do we, do we just go, or...

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,630
do you do a bit of a
speech, or what happens now?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,790
Well, we're sad to see Aine go.
We've loved having you here.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,190
Oh God, I've had the time of my life, I hope
to come back as often as my schedule allows

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,190
I'm sorry you didn't have a great time.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,830
No, I didn't expect it to be a
great time, Teresa, I'm not stupid,

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,910
- I just, it's a lot of... Shona's money...
- Don't worry about it.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,950
No, I'm just saying cos I think the
facilities could have been nicer,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,990
- like the website shows.
- Yeah, I know.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,790
In fairness to Aine, when I booked her in,

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,270
- the website did make it look
like there was a jacuzzi... - Yeah.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,630
And the jacuzzi was half how I convinced
her to come here in the first place!

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,630
- Yeah! - You know, cos
I said, you know...

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,990
- at the worst, if she came, at
least there'd be a jacuzzi. - Yeah.

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,470
Of course, as it turned out,
it's just a picture of a...

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,830
- Duck pond. - Duck
pond. - Yeah. - Which...

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,790
But, like I said, this is not
a spa, it's a rehab facility,

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,030
- so we plough our money into care
and therapists. - Yeah, I know,

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,230
- but I just don't see how a jacuzzi...
- Or a plunge pool.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,030
.. would be a bad thing for people
who just needed a bit of a boost.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,550
Mm-hm.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,430
Come on, Sho, it doesn't matter.

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,400
So, any other... feedback,
before you head off?

27
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,110
Why are you saying it like that?

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,990
Why are you saying "feedback" like that?

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,950
All businesses should
appreciate feedback, OK?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,430
I'm in business, I love feedback.

31
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,070
- And yeah, I do, actually, and
don't take it the wrong way...
- Oh, just leave it, Sho. - Just on

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,470
e second.

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,550
Also on your website, you say you
get all sorts of people here.

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,670
But Aine tells me, when they were
having the group therapy sessions,

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,390
- they mainly dealt with addiction
and not with... - Nervous breakdown?

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,790
Oh, is that what I fall under?

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,910
- I thought it was mostly Bs,
creative type. - Don't be sarky!

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,870
- I'm not, I'm being sassy!
- I'm gonna punch your face in a minute.

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,390
I actually have some practical feedback.

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,510
- Oh, good.
- Just as regards snacks.

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,070
So I was thinking,

42
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,390
mini-bars...

43
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,910
I'm actually being serious,
Teresa! Because one day,

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,030
when I was really low,
I would've happily paid

45
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,470
double the recommended
retail price to eat a Kit Kat

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,350
without everyone gawping at me.

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,720
And ideally, in a fucking jacuzzi.

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,830
I'm sorry for cursing there.

49
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,950
That's OK.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,510
Erm, can I have the...

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
- car keys?
- Mm.

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,630
Erm... Yeah.

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
Thanks, er, for everything, Teresa.

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,520
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,990
Oi, oi!

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,790
Take me with ya!

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,590
Is she, um...

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,110
Is she fixed?

59
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,230
It's just, I didn't really
see this coming, so...

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,990
I can see you guys are close, yeah?

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,750
Yeah, well, she's my only
sister. Or brother, or...

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,470
I know this must have been a shock.

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,990
Cos with someone like Aine, we
try and get them back to a place

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,270
where they can care about themselves
enough to take care of themselves.

65
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,630
When she got here, she
could hardly open her eyes,

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,990
and now she's...
complaining about Kit Kats.

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,600
She's made of hardy stuff.

68
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,630
OK.

69
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,270
- Yeah?
- All right.

70
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,760
Cool, thank you for that.

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,360
- Bye. - Bye. - Oh, and, um...

72
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,190
I mean, that's kind of
what I meant. Earlier.

73
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,750
You know, when I said about
a speech, what you just did.

74
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,070
So, I don't know, next time...
I mean, this is feedback.

75
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,240
Yeah. Thanks.

76
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,470
Right, guys, OK.

77
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,110
This should be easy by
now, OK? The family.

78
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,950
We all know that Kourtney is the...

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,190
Eldest.

80
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,710
Very good, yes.

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,110
But Kim is the...

82
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,950
- Second eldest.
- Second eldest, very good.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,950
But after that, then we have Khloe.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,830
- Khloe is the...
- Middle.

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,910
Middle, Mo! Yes, fantastic!

86
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,310
Now, she was -- past tense
-- WAS the youngest.

87
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,950
Until along came...

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,830
- Kendall and Kylie.
- Kendall and Kylie.

89
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,110
And they are the daughters...
The daughters of...

90
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,270
- Kris.
- Kris! Yes, very good.

91
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,910
Give me a high five -- lovely.

92
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,190
Now, Kris, who is the...

93
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,750
- Mother.
- Mother!

94
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,230
Welcome, Victor! Hello!
Yes -- mother. Fantastic.

95
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,550
OK, so they are the daughters
of Kris and Caitlyn.

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,030
Also the mother.

97
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,070
.. Is Caitlyn Jenner, the mother.

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,150
Eh...

99
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,390
I don't think that

100
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,510
she... is the mother...

101
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,430
She's Caitlyn?

102
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,550
She is Caitlyn. Exactly.
And that ends that chat.

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,950
I love this TV Friday.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,560
Oh, yeah. And who doesn't
love the Kardashians?

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,230
No, that was a rhetorical,
not a real question.

106
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,670
So you can put your hands down.

107
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,870
Uh, in Romania, I see
Kardashians all the time.

108
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,430
I have big TV.

109
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,910
Oh!

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,350
But here, Sky TV, a lot money.

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,950
Only laptop, or BBC.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,230
So Sky TV

113
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,390
costs... You getting
this down, on your thing?

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,590
Costs too much money. Mm-hm.

115
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,750
Rent costs too much money.

116
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,870
Yes, rent costs too much money.

117
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,190
And guys, listen. I know it can be tough.

118
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,270
It can be tough. But you know what?

119
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,950
Love...

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,550
costs...

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,950
nothing!

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,350
- Aw!
- Aw!

123
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,990
Love costs zero pounds.

124
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,430
And I love you.

125
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,790
And we love you!

126
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,990
Ah, stop it, you're breaking my heart!

127
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,110
Right, fill out all of those
worksheets by Monday, though,

128
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,030
or I will Brexit the lot of you.

129
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,350
It's the weekend!

130
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,430
Give yourselves a round of applause!

131
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,230
It's the weekend!

132
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,590
- Keeping it professional in here?
- Yes, very much so.

133
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,590
Actually, Mo, can you
take out those plugs,

134
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,150
I spilled water all over the
sockets. So just be careful.

135
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,950
No, Mo, don't touch that
socket if it's wet. Aine...

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm a-joking! It's one of
my little jokes for you.

137
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,790
Hi, Emma, Aine here.

138
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,630
Just wondering what to
bring for dinner tonight,

139
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,230
I'm thinking pavlova or a bag of ketamine!

140
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,030
I'm super-psyched to
meet all your friends...

141
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,590
You are literally just texting
me as I talk to you on the phone.

142
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,470
"Sophie being weird about
people she doesn't know coming,

143
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,430
"don't think I can bring
you along any more..."

144
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,630
Oh, yeah, that is totally fine!

145
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,550
Eh, I totally get that.

146
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,750
Um... Eh... Yeah, I had loads
of other things to do anyways.

147
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,870
Yeah, I'll just eat the
pavlova and ketamine myself.

148
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,950
Have a great night. Bye!

149
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,630
'Hi, you've reached Shona's
voicemail. Leave a message.'

150
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,910
Uh, hello, Shona, it's
me, Dr Morag Sporran

151
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,590
from the STD clinic.

152
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,030
I'm ringing re your test results.

153
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,550
Unfortunately, confirming our worst fears,

154
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,030
your fanny is rotten from the inside out.

155
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,790
So we're going to have to remove it.

156
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,910
Ah...

157
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,510
Hi, it's me. What are you doing tonight?

158
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,270
Ring back when you get this. OK, bye!

159
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,030
Archway Psychotherapy.

160
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,510
Hiya, yeah, could I
speak to Helen, please?

161
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,070
Are you a patient, or family?

162
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,190
Um, patient.

163
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,190
I'm afraid she's not free right now.
Want to schedule a call for next week?

164
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,310
Eh, could I just not speak
to someone... Helen, now?

165
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,630
Just cos I've, erm....

166
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,430
I've just shoplifted a
smoothie, so feeling a bit...

167
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,990
Actually, could I speak to Helen
about this rather than you?

168
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,430
I'm waiting schedule a call for next week.

169
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,400
No, cos I said... What if
I was about to kill myself?

170
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,310
Are you?

171
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,760
Would that get me through
to Helen, if I said I was?

172
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,550
No. As I say, she's unavailable.

173
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,360
Thanks for nothing. Bye.

174
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,230
- Hey.
- Hi, you OK?

175
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,710
What are you doing here?

176
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,270
What am I doing here? Stop flirting with
me, Vish, you're my suster's boyfriend!

177
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,150
Look, she is five minutes behind me, OK,

178
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,550
so don't make her late.

179
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,430
Is that you, Aine?

180
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,790
No, it's your elderly neighbour, Mildred!

181
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,030
Psst! Hey! That is a sourdough
I'm proving under a tea towel.

182
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,550
It is my little newborn. So don't poke it.

183
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,470
I will not make her late and I
will not poke your sourdough.

184
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,270
- Love you! - Bye.
- Please don't be late.

185
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,630
Hey, that homeless man out the front of
your building's nice. You get my voicemail?

186
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,110
No, I got your text, what's wrong?

187
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,710
Listen to it, it's really funny.

188
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,510
What do you mean, listen
to it, I'm in a rush!

189
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,870
You have that party
tonight, the dinner party?

190
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,950
Eh, no..?

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,870
Oh, no! Why, what happened?

192
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,230
Oh, no, it's just turned
into like a pub thing later.

193
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,590
Oh, that's more fun, probably.

194
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,190
- Yeah.
- Chance to meet new people.

195
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,790
- Mm-hm. - Bruce reckons he
makes £200 a day out there.

196
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,110
Who?

197
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,390
"Who". Homeless guy.

198
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,390
Don't eat that fruit salad!

199
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,840
It's Vish's breakfast.

200
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,870
God, Vish is driving me nuts right now.

201
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,710
Just keeps alluding to moving in.

202
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,190
You know, but in a sneaky way,
like, he makes his sourdough here.

203
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,110
He says the butter fits in his house.

204
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,870
Oh, that's so sneaky!

205
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,510
Imagine loving you so much that he'd...

206
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,150
want you to live in his
mahoosive house, rent-free?

207
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,190
And anyway, if I move in, then what next?

208
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,190
We'd either break up, or get married.

209
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,630
I wish you guys would get married so I
can do my hilarious best man speech.

210
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,830
Honestly, my opening gag is

211
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,030
mwah-mwah-mwah, mwah-mwah!

212
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,270
- What's your opening gag?
- Oh, I'm not going to tell you

213
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,510
because I want the look on your
face on the day to be real.

214
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,510
Right, well, I've no interest for
marriage so you may as well tell me now.

215
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,150
Shona! Don't say that. If you don't
get married, I can't get married.

216
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,310
Because it's bad luck and unnatural

217
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,510
for the younger sister
to wed before the elder.

218
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,710
Stop talking about it now,
cos I'm getting stressed.

219
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,950
Can you do my back?

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,790
No, last time I did this, my
hands were brown for two days!

221
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,680
Just do it, it's wash-off!

222
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,110
- What were you doing in Green
Park the other night? Ow! - Shona!

223
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,110
I'll unmatch you on Find My Phone if you don't
stop stalking me, you're like a creepy uncle!

224
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,430
I'm not stalking you, I'm
just checking where you are

225
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,840
so I can sleep at night.

226
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,270
What are you doing there?

227
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,990
Can you do it a bit
gentler, it's gonna smear.

228
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,230
I, er, I went for a walk.

229
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,750
10pm at night?

230
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,550
Yes, after the cinema.

231
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,190
Oh, OK, who did you go to the cinema with?

232
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,750
No one, who would I have
to go to the cinema with?

233
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,670
- Don't say that, that just makes me sad.
- Well, it's true, isn't it?

234
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,550
I'll go to the cinema with you!

235
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,750
What did you see?

236
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,430
I saw a big porno

237
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,710
with loads of young lads riding holes...

238
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,190
Look, just don't go walking
around at night on your own, OK?

239
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,670
It stresses me out -- you'll
get raped or murdered.

240
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,270
- Chance would be a fine thing.
- Jesus...

241
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,430
- No, I know I shouldn't...
- Why would you say that?

242
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,280
- So sorry, I shouldn't have said
it, touch wood. - Touch wood.

243
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,590
- Oh, Sho...
- What?

244
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,710
You've just got... a
little spot, can I pop it?

245
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,030
- No, you cannot pop it!
- No, I don't want to,

246
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,390
but what if someone sees
your back tonight and vomits?

247
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Oh, Jesus, OK, then!

248
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,990
- Ow, fucking hell!
- Oh, God! Sorry.

249
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,190
That's disgusting.

250
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,550
Don't wipe it on my bedding!

251
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,510
What, I wipe it on your back, then?

252
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,190
OK, you can go now.

253
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,910
Thank you, master!

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
Don't make me laugh, I'll sweat.

255
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,920
Are you OK?

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,310
Oh my God, what are you wearing?!

257
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,550
- What?
- WHERE did you get that?

258
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,990
Forever 21.

259
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,910
Well, that's a bit of fucking
irony if I ever heard of it.

260
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,510
Oh, is it awful? I thought I
looked kind of Wonder Woman-y.

261
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,400
Ah, no! It's just a bit...

262
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,520
- .. prostitute-y. - Aine! - Shona!

263
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,950
You've a sweatshop full of clothes,

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,350
- why don't you wear something
from that? - No, I don't.

265
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,000
And I look old and awful
and I've nothing to wear.

266
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
What are you wearing under your cardigan?

267
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,150
My black pleather mini.

268
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,670
Literally just help yourself
to anything that's on there, OK?

269
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,830
- Mm-hm. - Except for the dry cleaning
stuff. Oh, and the white dress.

270
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,390
What time are you heading out?

271
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,640
Oh, they're gonna text me soon.

272
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,830
Uh?

273
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,800
Yeah, but I'll probably just
scoot straight after you.

274
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,390
Are you OK?

275
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,270
Yeah, I'm grand!

276
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,310
Grand, yeah, course!

277
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,670
- Cos you can come to this thing with
me if you want. - No, you're mad!

278
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,190
You doughnut. Imagine me at
an event with all the suits.

279
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,790
Oh hey, listen, can I show you my thing?

280
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,390
- Ah honey, I've got to...
- No, no, wait.

281
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,550
- Just wait a second. Look at this.
- Show me.

- You OK?
- Yeah, sorry. Distracted.

303
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,310
The way you looked at me, I thought
I'd made an Irish name mistake.

Listen, I'll answer to any
Irish name -- Siobhan...

turned around for Seamus...

I'm glad you're here.

307
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,950
I thought I was gonna be
the only womb present.

308
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,470
- Yeah, God, me too.
- You coming in?

309
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,110
Erm...

310
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,200
Yeah.

311
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,790
God, I can smell the Lynx Africa already.

312
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,590
See, I knew Aine was gonna make you late!

313
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,430
There they are, the
power ladies of finance!

314
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,670
Freddie! I knew you'd turn
up for a night of free drink.

315
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,920
I just hope we can squeeze some
juice out of these wealthy lemons!

316
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,270
How's Aine, Sho?

317
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,990
Yeah, she's absolutely fantastic.

318
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,270
Uh, hey, Sho, so we have one woman
and three brown people up there

319
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,110
out of 150, so it's like Christmas.
Sho and I have this favourite game

320
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,670
where we drink a shot every time
we see a brown person or a woman

321
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,790
- working in finace.
- It's a shit drinking game,

322
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,470
- cos you stay really sober.
- Does that make me a double threat?

323
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,550
Yeah! So you'd be two tequilas.

324
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,870
And I'm, obviously, minus points.

325
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,480
Yeah, you are.

326
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,030
Right, well, let's get in there!

327
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,030
See what juice we can squeeze
out of these wealthy lemons!

328
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,710
Oh my God, you already said that, mate.

329
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,830
- What's going on? - I just don't
know where she... She's gone home.

330
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,470
I don't know why she's gone home.
Getting changed, or something.

331
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,990
- What are you doing?
- Just be here.

332
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,470
Be here, all right? She's
fine. She's with her friends,

333
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,510
- making new friends...
- I am here! - Just chill.

334
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,230
I am. I'll see you up...

335
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,150
What are you hanging out with
Freddie for anyway, you Judas?

336
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,310
Judas? He's part of the group!

337
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,630
- Well, don't tell Aine.
- I won't tell Aine!

338
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,150
I won't tell her how sexy
her sister looks tonight.

339
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,440
- Ah, thanks, hon. It's
Aine's skirt. - Ew.

340
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,450
- Oh, God, fucking Jesus.
- No, just me. Hello, sunshine.

341
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,490
Hello. My God, Bradley, where you off to?

342
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,010
I'm just gonna go and meet Emma.
Sorry about all the laundry.

343
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,210
- Not doing it and stuff.
- Oh, God, that's so cute.

344
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,250
- What? Have you been to the gym?
- Sorry, no, my sister took my skirt.

345
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,850
- Ah.
- So...

346
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,500
Yeah, OK, have fun.

347
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,660
Police! Open up!

348
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,470
Ah!

349
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,250
Oh no, I thought it was gonna
be that stripper I ordered.

350
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,090
Hi! Hi!

351
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,290
- Good to see you.
- Hi. Yeah.

352
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,410
It's weird seeing you in the real world.

353
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,810
You look well out of
tracksuit bottoms though.

354
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,850
- Been watching Queer Eye, haven't I?
- I love it, I love it.

355
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,400
- Yeah? What do you reckon?
- You look like a male model.

356
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,490
So erm... you still drinking, then, yeah?

357
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,250
Oh, yeah, yeah, but my problem
wasn't that I was drinking, Tom.

358
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,610
It was that I was too much
of a... fucking legend!

359
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,810
Anyway, will you take
these over to the couch?

360
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,250
Er, yeah, yeah, why not.

361
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,740
Young lady.

362
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,850
I got called a gay
knobhead by my best friend.

363
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,010
For watching football
with an orange juice.

364
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,090
You should just go and watch
the football in Starbucks.

365
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,010
Oh yeah, shout "Who are ya?
Who are ya? Who are ya?"

366
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,010
over a mocha fucking latte!

367
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,010
I never get that with "Who are
ya?" It's like, "Who are ya?"

368
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,930
Are you supposed to
answer? Like, "I'm Aine."

369
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,260
All right.

370
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,780
W-what's going on here?

371
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,300
I know, they remind you
of two lovely melons.

372
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,980
Oh, Jesus.

373
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,050
We shouldn't do this, Aine.

374
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,770
- What?! - You know we
don't fancy each other.

375
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,250
No, I don't know that, no.

376
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,010
Look, you've got cracking boobs but...

377
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,690
Think what Theresa said.

378
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,490
- You know, one year of celibacy --
- Fuck celibacy!

379
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,610
- Don't be silly.
- No, no, no! Don't you get it?

380
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,450
I'm trying to fucking
respect you here, you mug!

381
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,330
God! Could you not have
respected me after we had sex?

382
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,650
Oh, come on, you know this is a bad idea.

383
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,490
Oh, God, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, I know, I know, I know, Tom.

384
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,930
But do you ever just wanna feel
something for five fucking minutes?

385
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,170
Course I do. I just don't want us
to set each other off or anything.

386
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,050
Shit. They really are cracking boobs.

387
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,170
- I know.
- I'm sorry, babes.

388
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,210
I... You're gonna thank me
for this in the morning.

389
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,020
I will not thank you for
this in the morning, Tom.

390
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,690
What? What's wrong? Do you
wanna give it another go?

391
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,450
No. Th-the thing is...

392
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,980
The erm... Is the trains.

393
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,050
Oh, Jesus on a stick!

394
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,290
I always thought Vish was American.

395
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,690
Oh, God, no, he just
spent ages in New York.

396
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,250
- Then a bit of time in Hong Kong.
- Thought I detected Hongkongese.

397
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,530
I'm so glad you're here.

398
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,450
I hate going out but it has
given my cat a chance to miss me.

399
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,010
- I can't imagine you as a cat erm...
- La... A cat lady?

400
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,180
Is that what you're
calling me? Unbelievable.

401
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,090
- Somewhere else you need to be?
- Oh, shit, sorry, that's so rude.

402
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,410
No, my sister er... I don't wanna
bore you with my personal life.

403
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,690
Spent most of the day on
my own eating noodles.

404
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,650
Yeah? Is that your cat's name?

405
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,610
No, erm... Freddie's
actually my sister's ex.

406
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,650
Oh, God! Oh, my God.

407
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,890
You know Helen who we
were talking to inside?

408
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,610
- Yeah. Bit of a dullard.
- She's my ex.

409
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,810
Is she?

410
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,060
- So sorry. Though in fairness...
- Yeah, she is a dullard.

411
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,610
Sorry if I made it
awkward earlier but er...

412
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,730
I wasn't in the mood to pretend
to like Freddie. Ah, shit, Aine.

413
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,930
Erm... Do you know what,
I'm gonna have to skedaddle.

414
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,690
Sorry to leave you at the
frat party on your own.

415
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,010
No, go, go, but can we hang out again?

416
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,410
- Yeah.
- Is that uncool to ask?

417
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,820
No, I'd love that. We can bitch
about everyone who isn't us.

418
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,500
- See you.
- See you.

419
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,130
Stop stalking me.

420
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,980
Don't go walking on your own
in the park at night, Aine.

421
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,980
Come here.

422
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,180
I knew you weren't feeling right.

423
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,260
I'm grand.

424
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,860
And a crack addict just told
me I looked thin so, you know...

425
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,700
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

426
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,820
Take it when you can get it.

427
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,260
- Did you leave the party early?
- No, no. It was over.

428
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,900
- Anyone interesting there?
- No.

429
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,820
- Do you wanna see some dogs who
look like celebrities? - Course.

430
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,250
So funny.

431
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,820
Wait till you see this.

432
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,570
- Look, that's Richard Gere.
- Oh, yeah!

433
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,130
Yeah!

434
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,220
- Geri Halliwell!
- Yes! Geri Halliwell!

435
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,170
Yeah!

436
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,330
That lad I actually think looks like you.

437
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,810
That doesn't look like
me, it's a fucking pug!

438
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,090
Exactly, look at its short forehead.

439
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,370
That's Nicolas Cage!

440
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,450
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
That's totally amazing.

441
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,690
Show me that again.

442
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,690
Oh, wow! That's brilliant.

443
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,220
I think I fancy that dog more
than I fancy actual Nicolas Cage.

444
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,490
A guy has put out the
job with his French kid.

445
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,170
- You speak French.
- Oui, monsieur. Je parle un peu.

446
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,370
His mother died recently
and I'm his legal guardian.

447
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,610
- His father?
- Yeah. Yeah. That too.

448
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,210
Oh, my God! Jesus! Victor,
what happened to you?

449
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,970
- You have children, Aine?
- Not that I know of.

450
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,090
- I'm such an idiot.
- Yeah. No news there then.

451
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,610
- Eat my arse, Shona.
- You don't have any arse.
