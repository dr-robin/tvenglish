Oh, my God, have you
ever known a better song?

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,150
There's your dad.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,470
Hi.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,590
Right, in you go.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,710
The good news is if dear Etienne
here needs to go to the doctor,

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,150
he can point out exactly where it hurts.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,430
Great.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,470
As long as it's his head, his
shoulders, his knees, or his toes.

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,670
Or his eyes, or his ears.

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,590
What if he breaks his finger?

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,710
Well, then he'll probably
find it difficult to type.

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,550
There it is.

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,630
Richard, can we put some
of my photos downstairs?

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,790
Oh, yeah, of course.

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,480
It is... It's your home, too.

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,790
Do you wanna join me for dinner?

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,990
Oh! That's nice.

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,190
I haven't actually eaten yet, so...

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,430
- Oh, I was talking to Etienne.
- Oh...

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,150
Oh, sorry.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,310
Just cos you were speaking
so formally to a child.

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,390
You can stay, if you want, er...

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,710
- Marcia's made plenty.
- That's nice, but, um...

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,550
Please... Please won't you?

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,230
Though she did say that she
put a poisoned pepper in it.

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,070
Hm?

34
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,230
I wasn't serious.

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,750
Oh! Right... God, OK.

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,840
Cos just you seemed very serious.

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,230
Yeah, my mother was
actually a TV personality.

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,630
Really.

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,790
She was just on Irish TV.

40
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,410
Um, she...

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,670
- She used to do the weather,
on television... - Right.

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,310
.. but every day she'd
wear a different hat.

43
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,310
How about that?

44
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,510
That was her thing.

45
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,710
Irish people loved it.

46
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,030
I mean, not this Irish person. I hated it.

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,280
- What about your dad?
- No, he only had the one hat.

48
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,510
He's dead, too.

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,510
OK, merci, monsieur.

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,160
Nice to see you're keeping
all the secrets I tell you.

51
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,670
Sorry to hear that.

52
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,350
It's OK, though it is
a bit of a sad story.

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
Um...

54
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,430
My mother's hat collection
fell on top of him.

55
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,830
And...

56
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,350
.. he was smothered to death

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,510
by the hats.

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,900
That's...

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,390
Oh, my God!

60
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,390
Are you laughing, Richard?

61
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,080
Stop! You're freaking me out, man!

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,630
Yeah, I guess laughing
hasn't been much of a...

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,310
- .. a priority of late.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,870
Obviously...

65
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,830
Listen, you don't need to
hang around here with us.

66
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,270
- Um...
- Oh, my God!

67
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,350
I'm so sorry for taking up your time.

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,870
- I'm not trying to shoo you out.
- Oh, no, no, no.

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,150
No, oh God, yeah. I shouldn't be...

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,310
- I mean, I invited myself for dinner.
- Thanks for joining us.

71
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,430
No, thank you for the...

72
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,750
I mean, you really know how to
pay someone to cook for you.

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,110
So...

74
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,070
- OK. - Yeah. - Right.

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,870
No...

76
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,270
Aine, please stay.

77
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,270
Do you know what I do
have to leave cos I've got

78
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,750
places to go and stuff.

79
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,120
- I'm sure you do.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,630
Um... Yeah, I'll see Monday.

81
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,910
And good luck with your photos and stuff.

82
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,750
I really wanna see them, so...

83
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,150
Um... Yeah.

84
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,120
- OK, see you Monday.
- Yeah, see you Monday.

Oh, my God!

88
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,550
I can't believe you've got
rats. That's disgusting!

89
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,310
Yeah, I know, it's awful!

90
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,350
I don't know how they got
there, but sixth floor,

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,270
they must have had a ladder, or something.

92
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,550
We're watching that
murdered nun documentary.

93
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,710
- Oh... - So what did your
man say, to smoke them out?

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,830
- Smoke them out?
- What?

95
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,070
No, Clint Eastwood's rat catching
service was closed, Shona.

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,710
What are you talking about?

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,360
Smoking out is a thing. How
else do you get rid of a rat?

98
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,430
You sound like a Cockney criminal.

99
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,230
How do you get rid of a rat, boy?

100
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,790
Do you want me to pause this
while we're talking about rats?

101
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,630
- No, no.
- I will if you want me to.

102
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,070
No, I'm dying to watch
this. I just like the nun.

103
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,920
Mm.

104
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,830
Have you eaten?

105
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,510
Oh, yeah, I have, actually.

106
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,990
I ate at Richard's house.

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,190
- Who? - Richard. The
man who I teach for.

108
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,510
- What?!
- Yeah, he included me in dinner.

- No, don't... - Be careful.
- I knew you'd say that.

111
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,950
- It was totally professional.
- Of course I'm gonna say that.

I'm watching this!

They've just moved that head

Oh, gosh. They're called
bishops, by the way.

115
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,510
- Bishops... whatever!
- Head priest. - Head priest!

116

Er, not from the waist up, no.

to knock next time.

139

Did you call your man?
When are the rats out?

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,590
I didn't know you started
eating chicken again.

When did you start eating chicken?

142
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,510
I thought you watched Cowspiracy.
It says it in your Netflix.

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,830
- Cows are the worst.
- Yeah.

144
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,270
Chicken is not a cow and I knew
you were logging into my Netflix.

- It's a little bit funny.

It's not, it's disgusting.

150
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,070
It's just I'm not used to boys
being here and having to knock.

Well, I don't wanna
stay here, but I have to

152
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,710
because your sister hates houses
that have private bathrooms

153

and underfloor heating.

154
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,030
I moved my toothbrush in three
weeks ago. That's enough for now.

Good luck! Sounds like hell.

159
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,750
It is, but he's the last one of our
gang that's getting married, so...

160

Unless one of us does it again.

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,950
Oh!

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,110
Well, let me know when you plan
to marry your ex-wife again.

163
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,190
She was too short for me, anyway.

164
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,150
All right. Thanks for this, love you.

165
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,750
Oh, love you, too, Vish.

166
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,070
I'm really sorry, again, about poo-gate.

167
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,710
OK, it was...

168
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,200
Hey!

169
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,790
You know, you don't have to
take care of her all weekend.

170
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,070
- Huh! - It's not good
for either one of you.

171
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,270
I'm not, I'm gonna kick her
out, get her some fresh air.

172
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,510
- I promise.
- Oh, OK.

173
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,750
- You need to relax.
- Yes.

174
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,470
- Chill out.
- Yes, I know!

175
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,750
- I'm not working. - Good.
- I'm gonna chill out.

176
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,830
- Bye.
- Bye.

177
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,470
- Don't get killed.
- I won't. Bye!

178
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,790
Oh, bye, Vish.

179
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,550
Um, when you're on the stag
just don't show anyone your penis

180
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,350
cos that's just for
Shona and me to see. OK?

181
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,280
Bye.

182
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,670
OK, what did your man
say when you called him?

183
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,310
- What?
- When are you getting back in?

184
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,430
Oh, the rats? Um...

185
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,910
Well, they'll all technically
be dead by tomorrow,

186
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,110
but then they have to do
something awful, like,

187
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,590
scoop up the bodies
afterwards, or something.

188
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,550
- So I think... Monday.
- In that case three things.

189
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,750
- Mm-hm. - Charlotte's coming
over to work, don't tell Vish.

190
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,590
My best friend, Charlotte.

191
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,790
Well, very funny, so make yourself scarce.

192
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,270
What?

193
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,270
Shona...

194
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,710
Can I not just hide in your room?

195
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,070
No, I'd feel bad asking you to do that.

196
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,480
So, just, you know, leave instead.

197
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,750
- What am I gonna do? - Aine, I'm
not your event and live planner, OK?

198
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,310
Just figure it out.

199
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,190
And it's Saturday, go do something fun.

200
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,630
OK.

201
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,550
Second and third things.

202
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,950
We've got a cousin in London.

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,870
Mam wants us to hang out with him.

204
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,030
Oh, fuck that! Is he Irish?

205
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,150
We have to, OK. Apparently they
were nice after daddy died.

206
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,870
What?

207
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,750
Yeah. They, um...

208
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,670
I don't know, they threw some money
in for the coffin, or something.

209
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,750
I don't know. Anyway, you
gotta hang out with him.

210
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,630
I can't cos I've too much on.

211
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,070
- Oh, and this lad's Irish.
- Who, her cousin?

212
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,350
Yeah, but no, the lad I'm
gonna fix you up with.

213
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,830
- No! Shona.
- Yes.

214
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,350
- I don't want...
- I swear to you you will love him.

215
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,750
- No. - I know him, he works
on the floor below me.

216
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,190
- No, no, no.
- He's nice,

217
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,670
a little bit weird, like you.

218
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,190
No set-ups, oh, my God.

219
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,670
I'm glad you've got dental floss.

220
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,790
I've had a bit of celery stuck in
my back tooth for, like, three days.

221
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,790
Aine, floss over the sink.

222
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,640
Oh! Don't walk around my house
getting bacteria all over the place.

223
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
OK, so...

224
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,190
Why don't you head out for a bit. Yeah?

225
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,830
It's not good for you to be
hanging around the house all day.

226
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,470
Or, just with me.

227
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,280
- Hey?
- Yeah, OK.

228
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,830
Well, if you're sticking
around I'm gonna Skype mam

229
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,110
- and you can have a chat
with her. - No, Shona. - What?

230
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,470
You don't need to threaten me.

231
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,670
I'm not. Oh, my God.
I'm not threatening you.

232
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,830
God! Fine! I'll leave this
house full of lies and deceit.

233
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,110
Smoked out, like a rat.

234
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,870
Look, you have to call her, anyway.

235
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,350
- You haven't talked to her in ages.
- Yeah, I'll...

236
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,230
We can Skype her later when I'm not here.

237
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,270
Oh, my God, you're such a baby.

238
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,590
You're a brat!

239
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,630
What? I text her last week
to see if she was dead, so...

240
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,910
- Ow! - That's not even
funny, don't say that.

241
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,230
Shona! You can't do the same place twice.

242
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,840
It's illegal.

243
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,840
- Bye.
- Bye!

244
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,150
What brings you here today?

245
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,350
Um...

246
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,670
So maybe romance, I suppose,
that's kind of a classic.

247
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,670
Anyone coming along who
thinks I'm not totally shite.

248
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,950
OK.

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,680
I'll just check-in.

250
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,390
Your ownish is very female.

251
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,390
Oh, my God, am I gonna
fall in love with a woman?

252
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,630
- Don't interrupt.
- Sorry.

253
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,510
Male energy is very exotic to you.

254
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,870
You're very star-struck by male energy.

255
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,270
Yeah.

256
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,560
A big dick energy.

257
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,230
You need to manage that.

258
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,150
- Mm-hm. - And I'm
getting a brother figure.

259
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,990
Oh, yeah, that's probably Vish.

260
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,230
He's my maybe brother-in-law.

261
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,750
OK, so I'm getting a three-figure.

262
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,310
Three is unbalancing.

263
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,470
What, so, like, I'm unbalancing...

264
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,830
What, so they don't want me there?

265
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,470
- Are you there a lot?
- Yeah.

266
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,350
I think they like having me there.

267
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,270
Do you think they don't
like having me there?

268
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
I don't know them.

269
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,550
You've got a fire in you.

270
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,190
- OK, what's your name
again? - Aine. - Aine.

271
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,430
You've got a fire in you

272
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,430
and you can use that to heat yourself up.

273
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,030
- That's why I try...
- Don't interrupt.

274
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,390
Sorry.

275
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,280
Or you can use that to burn yourself
and everyone else around you down.

276
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,150
Right, well, I was just, sort of,
hoping for the lottery numbers,

277
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,640
but OK.

278
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,430
I suppose that's the new crossing
the palm with silver, is it?

279
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,230
It's easier for the tax receipts.

280
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,870
Yeah. OK.

281
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,030
Well, thank you.

282
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,750
Er, bye.

283
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,070
Actually...

284
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,070
Um, before I go, I don't know if, um,

285
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,390
you know you've got your, er...

286
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,710
Like, phone thing, or
whatever, turned off.

287
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,840
Um, there wasn't any word from...

288
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,540
.. the angels whoever from...

289
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,200
.. my father, from my daddy, was there?

290
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,630
He's passed on, has he?

291
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,120
Er, yeah.

292
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,960
No... Sorry.

293
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,110
Right, yeah. Grand, just thought
it'd be worth a shot, so...

294
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,590
Sometimes people don't get in touch

295
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,140
until you're ready to hear
what they wanna tell you.

296
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,350
Yeah, OK.

297
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,760
Well, um... Have a great
day, anyway. See ya.

298
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,190
Er, we'll be closing soon.

299
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,870
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,390
Yeah, well, you know, I
have to be off, anyway, so...

301
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,430
Yeah, it'll be fine. If I can't
close up, I can't get home.

302
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,980
We all have homes to go to, mate.

303
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,120
Oh, my God, Freddie!

304
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,270
- 'Hey.'
- Hiya.

305
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,390
Can I come back yet?

306
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,390
'Come to the pub, will you,
the one near the park.'

307
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,590
Oh, er, the one where your
man with the hair worked?

308
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,110
- 'Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'
- Yeah, great.

309
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,470
Yeah, cool, brilliant.

310
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,080
I'm en route. I'll hop on a tube.

311
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,590
Um...

312
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,550
I actually have to go now.

313
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,750
Yeah.

314
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Sorry about that. See ya!

315
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,110
He's nice.

316
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,990
Ah, there she is.

317
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,430
Aine, this is Charlotte.

318
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,590
Oh, my God, hi!

319
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,670
- Oh, God, you do have
lovely skin. - What?!

320
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,670
I could make a soft bag out of that face.

321
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,310
- Should I be scared, or flattered?
- Ah, with Aine probably both.

322
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,310
And there's David back again.

323
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,390
Who?

324
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,590
David.

325
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,030
Aine, David. I was telling you about.

326
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,350
Right, we're off.

327
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,790
What?! Where are you guys going?

328
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,870
You know, I told you, we've
got all that work to do.

329
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,830
I thought David could
keep you company, there.

330
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,030
David bought you a pint,
which was nice of him.

331
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,950
- How did David know what I wanted?
- I told David, so David knew.

332
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,830
Well, it seems like David
has it all sorted out

333
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,870
and it's all very handy
and convenient for David.

334
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,630
- Why are you being so narky?
- It's nice to meet you, Aine.

335
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,750
Ah, there you go.

336
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,390
That's great. OK, let's go. It
was lovely seeing you, David.

337
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,470
Nice to meet you, Aine.

338
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,110
- You've lovely skin, too.
- Thank you.

339
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,510
Did you take my new lip balm?

340
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,270
No, I don't think so.

341
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,830
No, I was talking to Aine.

342
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,750
No, I used it, but I put it
back in your box, Princess Anne.

343
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,190
You didn't put it back in my
box cos I would have seen it.

344
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,950
- I put it back. - Do you know
what, forget it. It doesn't matter.

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,720
OK, have a great night. All the best!

346
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,440
Sensitive teeth.

347
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,970
And then later on he comes
up to me and he says,

348
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,970
"Word of advice. This
company's like a family.

349
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,650
And when Daddy's speaking the
little girl shuts the fuck up."

350
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,730
- No, he did not say that!
- Yes, he did.

351
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,930
Oh, my God! Did you
punch him in the balls?

352
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,450
I want to say yeah but, no, I
went into the toilet and cried.

353
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,930
Oh, no!

354
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,590
I'd be the same, actually.

355
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,090
That kind of thing makes me
really erm... emotional, you know?

356
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,250
- No, it's fine, honestly,
take it. - Yeah?

357
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,890
Yeah. It's like our little tradition now.

358
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,530
All right, I won't be
long. Hey. What's up?

359
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,970
- Hiya, can I come back yet?
- No. I left you an hour ago!

360
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,570
- Are you still with David?
- Course I am.

361
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,810
Nothing else to do that doesn't cost cash.

362
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,490
Just... Just stay out till 10ish, OK?

363
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,410
Have a laugh. Don't sleep with him though.

364
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,850
Yeah, right! You'd love that then I
could not come back to your house.

365
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,290
Don't get drunk, and get a taxi
home. Don't walk or I'll kill you.

366
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,340
OK, bye, love you.

367
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,050
That was quick. Did you wash your hands?

368
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,610
Er, no, I didn't need
to cos it was so quick.

369
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,650
Are you sure you don't want
any food? Got an empty belly.

370
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,690
- Getting my belly food.
- Yeah, go on, I'll go for food.

371
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,370
- Yes, get in!
- Do you wanna do some shots first?

372
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,780
Yeah? Shots? Er, I've actually
never done shots before.

373
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,140
Sorry.

374
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,370
Drama?

375
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,050
No. Why, does Freddie say
she comes with drama?

376
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,290
Shouldn't even be talking about
her, do you know that? Arse clown.

377
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,970
He didn't say anything.
That's not what I meant.

378
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,450
He's actually been asking
how she is a few times.

379
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,400
I know he's enemy number one.

380
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,930
Think he's seeing someone new now.

381
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,410
Is he? Who?

382
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,290
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

383
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,380
No, I -- Oh, God. Didn't
need to hear that.

384
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,730
Ugh. I don't think she needs to know that.

385
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,450
She's... She's had a bit of a...

386
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,770
tough run of it, you know. I
mean, she's great now but it's...

387
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,250
Does she... get depressed?

388
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,420
Erm...

389
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,090
No. No more than the rest of us.

390
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,530
I get it. I...

391
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,170
My brain's a bit shit.

392
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,370
But I take stuff for it
and I see a guy and...

393
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,210
And now I'm totally fine all the time.

394
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,610
Except when I... turn on the
news, scroll through Twitter,

395
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,300
then I wanna jump off a cliff.

396
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,290
Well, I mean...

397
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,090
She is totally fine now but... erm...

398
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,740
Last year she erm...

399
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,020
Well, we think she tried to...

400
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,330
But I got her in somewhere for a couple of
weeks and, you know, it's just really scary.

401
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,700
Yeah.

402
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,810
So that's why I'm...

403
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,930
The phone, like, you know.

404
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,770
Like, I know she's in the
pub, you know, where we were.

405
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,620
So, like, I don't need to worry.

406
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,210
OK.

407
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,290
Wow, wow, you need to keep eating steak.

408
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,330
Do you know, have you
watched The West Wing?

409
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,890
Oh my God, because actually apparently
that's exactly what it's like.

410
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,530
In the government in the White
House in America, very interesting.

411
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,970
This place is so random. Why
did you pick here for eating?

412
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
Cos my place is upstairs.

413
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,780
Your place is upstairs.

414
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,260
Oh, my God, how do I end up
in these fucking situations?

415
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,330
Blame Shona, that's how. Right, OK.

416
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,540
Right, yes, yes, yes, OK.

417
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,210
David, pretend to have your mind blown.

418
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,290
- What, you mean prepare to --
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,890
That's my gift to you there, David.

420
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,930
Erm... I've had a lovely evening.

421
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,610
Thanks very much for paying for
everything but I think you'll agree

422
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,250
that you got your money's worth
and it's time for me to go

423
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,610
and never call me again, OK? Thank you.

424
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,460
Something wrong with
that door man, mister.

425
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,620
Oh, my God.

426
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,370
You're not gonna rape me, are you?

427
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,010
I wish!

428
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,540
Mad man.

429
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,450
- What are you doing?
- Who the fuck is that on my couch?

430
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,210
- He's my neighbour and
he's Irish, Shona. - What?

431
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,850
- He's Irish.
- Jesus Christ!

432
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,850
- He's lost. - Do you have any
idea how dangerous that is?

433
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,410
Shona, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

434
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,770
And he's the only person in
the world who cares about me.

435
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,210
- And he is alone...
- Oh, for God's...

436
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,250
... so if you want to kick him out
on to the street then just do it.

437
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,970
I am gonna kill you in the morning.

438
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,730
If Vish knew about... He could rape us!

439
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,530
- Vish would rape us?
- The man on the sofa!

440
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,980
His name is... Pat.

441
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,890
And he promised he wouldn't.

442
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,450
I'm gonna lock my door.

443
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,730
OK, my own fucking bedroom door

444
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,980
because he is drunk and you
are drunk and I am... drunk!

445
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,580
But you are a fucking idiot, Aine.

446
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,580
I am so fucking angry with you right now!

447
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,410
- What?
- Let me in.

448
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
I'm sorry, Sho.

449
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,460
Please, sissy wissy,
don't be angwy with me.

450
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,930
I'm only a wittle girl.

451
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,810
I don't think he'd have sex with you
if he saw you with your retainer in.

452
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,410
Not funny, Aine! It's so dangerous!

453
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,450
I know, I'm so sorry. So sorry, so sorry.

454
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,420
So sorry...

455
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,340
Do you think Vish likes me?

456
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,780
- What?
- Nothing.

457
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,810
How was the rest of the
night with David anyway?

458
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,450
Oh, my God, bore fest.

459
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,950
I'm so glad.

460
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,930
Mam will be delighted you did it anyway.

461
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,460
How do you mean?

462
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,930
You went out with him. She'll tell the
family we took our cousin out, you know.

463
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,420
Showed him a good time. Made an effort.

464
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,340
- Shona...
- What?

465
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,860
I think I'm going to be sick.

466
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,170
♪ I can't wake up, see me
running round the corner

467
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,290

468
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,170
