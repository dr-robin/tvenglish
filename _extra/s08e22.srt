1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:09
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.Check it out.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Wow! It looks really violent!

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
I know. I'm coming soonto a theater near you.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
I'm in THX.I'm unsuitable for children!

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
- I cannot wait to see this.- It's generating Oscar buzz.

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
- I started that!- I thought I did!

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
I just talked to my agent...

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
...and the premiere is next weekand you're all invited!

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
- Will we take a limo?- Sure!

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
I love taking limoswhen nobody died.

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Well, I won't be able to come.

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
For those who haven't checkedtheir calendars, today's my due date.

14
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
I want to thank you guysfor how great you've been during this.

15
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
I couldn't have done it without you.I loved these last 9 months.

16
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
I'm looking forwardto the next part...

17
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
...but I am really gonna missbeing pregnant.

18
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
That's right. Still no baby.

19
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
Come on, people, make some room.

20
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
Sweetie, maybe you'd bemore comfortable here.

21
00:01:04 --> 00:01:05
You.

22
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
Like you haven't done enough.

23
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
I know you're miserable.I wish there was something I could do.

24
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
I wish I were a sea horse.

25
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
Because with sea horses, it's the male.They carry the babies.

26
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28
And then also,I'd be far away in the sea.

28
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
God.

29
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
I have never been so uncomfortablein my entire life.

30
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
I know. I remember toward the end...

31
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
That's a great story. Tell it whileyou're getting me some iced tea.

32
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
Oh, God, get out!Get out, get out, get out!

36
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

37
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
Do you want me to sit on you?Because I'll do it.

38
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
- What are you doing here?- They sent me home from work.

39
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
They said, "Start your maternityleave now. Just rest."

40
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
You know what? Screw them!

41
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
If they don't want me there,I'll hang out with you guys.

42
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
Or you could do volunteer work.

43
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
- Hello?- Joey, it's Estelle.

44
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
I was able to get you and one guesttickets to your premiere.

45
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
- You told me I could have six tickets.- I sold four on eBay.

46
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.

47
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
So that's it? I only getto bring one guest?

48
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
Yeah. What time do youwant to pick me up?

49
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
Hello?

50
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
You hear that?I only get one extra ticket.

51
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
So somehow I have to pickbetween you three and Ross.

52
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
- What about me?- You said you didn't want to go.

53
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
I would still liketo be acknowledged.

54
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
- Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?- Definitely not invisible.

55
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
Ross didn't care enoughto be here, so he's out.

56
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
- You snooze, you lose.- He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

57
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
Well, then somebody's snoozing.

58
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
And, Joey, not that this should affectyou at all, but if you pick me...

59
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
...I was planning on wearinga sequin dress cut down to here.

60
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
- I haven't seen this dress.- Star in a movie.

61
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
Pick whoever you want. Listento your heart. What does it tell you?

62
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.

63
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
Well...

64
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
I think I want to take Chandler.

65
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

66
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
- You want to take me?- Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.

67
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
But Chandler's alwayssupported my career.

68
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
He's paid for acting classes,headshots and stuff.

69
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
This will be my wayof paying you back.

70
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
So you're never actuallygoing to pay me back?

71
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
Just because he paid for yourheadshots, you're gonna take him?

72
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
I don't think you're comprehendingjust how slutty this dress is.

73
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
It's not just the stuff he paid for.It's everything, you know?

74
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
He read lines with me.He went with me on auditions.

75
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Then he consoled meafter I didn't get parts.

76
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
You always believed in me, man,even when I didn't.

77
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
I always knew you were gonna make it.I'm so proud of you.

78
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

79
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
Mon, maybe one of these guyswants to wear your dress.

80
00:05:07 --> 00:05:12
- I'm gonna go shave.- Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.

81
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
I have to pee.

82
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
If I don't come out, it's because I'vechoked to death on the potpourri stink.

83
00:05:22 --> 00:05:27
You hold her nose, I'll blow in hermouth and the kid'll just... out of her.

84
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
She's a week late.She's got to have it today.

85
00:05:31 --> 00:05:35
I don't know. I thinkit's still gonna be a while.

86
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
Care to make it interesting?

87
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
- I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.- You're on.

88
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
- Okay, how much?- One hundred thousand dollars.

89
00:05:44 --> 00:05:48
- How about 50 bucks?- I'll call Zurich and move some money.

90
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
All right, whose turn is itto help me get up?

91
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
No one's here.

92
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
Oh, damn it!

93
00:06:08 --> 00:06:12
This is exciting. So glamorous! Peopletaking our picture. How do I look?

94
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
- A little tall.- What?

95
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
Would you crouch down a bitso that I look taller?

96
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
There you go.

97
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
It's just so glamorous.

98
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

99
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
And you're still pregnant.

100
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
I'm sorry. I knowhow uncomfortable you are.

101
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
You know what? You look great.Yeah, like 50 bucks.

102
00:06:40 --> 00:06:45
I have to go pee. Apparently this babythinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

103
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

104
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
That's interesting that you lost.Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

105
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
All right, stop it.

106
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
- Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.- Fine.

107
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
Until then, General Grant, why don'tyou set up camp... right there?

108
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
- Rachel here? We have an appointment.- In the bathroom.

109
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
- Rach, we gotta go.- In a minute!

110
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
People ask why we're not together.I just don't know what to tell them.

111
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
- All right, let's go.- Do you want to go change first?

112
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
The doctor's staying open late for us,but if you hurry...

113
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
- No, I'm fine.- You don't think that's inappropriate?

114
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
- What?- Good God, man. Don't anger it.

115
00:07:32 --> 00:07:37
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.For the first time in weeks, I am...

116
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
Fine. Whatever you want.You're the mommy.

117
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
No! Don't call me "Mommy."

118
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
It's bad enough you callyour own mother that.

119
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
I'm actually with her on this one.

120
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
I thought I knew who the enemy was...

121
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
Okay, this is it. This ismy big fight scene coming up.

122
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
in the 82nd Ground Division.

123
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
Ross?Can I ask you something?

124
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
When Carol was pregnant with Ben...

125
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
...were you this irritating?

126
00:08:21 --> 00:08:22
- Excuse me?- Nothing. You're just...

127
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
You've been a little short with melately. I'm not trying to irritate you.

128
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
Well, then, you must havea natural talent for it.

129
00:08:30 --> 00:08:35
The doctor will be in soon.Why don't we not speak until then?

130
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.That's great.

131
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
We should ask the doctorif she even knows...

132
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
...how to deliver a babythat's half human, half pure evil!

133
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
- Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?- You're nice to her.

134
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
She has the drugs.

135
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
We'll do a quick check.

136
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
Eight days late, huh?You must be getting uncomfortable.

137
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
Yeah, just a tad.

138
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
You're 80%"%" effaced. You're on your way.It still could last a while.

139
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
- There are ways to help things along.- Do them!

140
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
Actually, they're thingsyou can do. Home remedies.

141
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
In my experience, I've foundsome are very effective.

142
00:09:22 --> 00:09:27
- Well, we are ready to try anything.- There's an herbal tea you can drink.

143
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
You can take some castor oil.There's spicy foods.

144
00:09:30 --> 00:09:31
We will do all of those.

145
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
- Taking a long walk.- Good. Done.

146
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
And there's the one that'sproved most effective: Sex.

147
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
You've got to be kidding me!

148
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

149
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
- You liked it? You really liked it?- Oh, yeah!

150
00:10:01 --> 00:10:05
- Well, which part exactly?- The whole thing! Here we go!

151
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

152
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
I loved the specifics.The specifics were the best part.

153
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
Hey, what about the scene withthe kangaroo? Did you like that part?

154
00:10:15 --> 00:10:20
I was surprised to see a kangarooin a World War I epic.

155
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
You fell asleep!

156
00:10:22 --> 00:10:27
There was no kangaroo! They didn'ttake any of my suggestions!

157
00:10:28 --> 00:10:32
- Thanks for coming. See you later.- Don't go. I'm so sorry.

158
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36
Look, this guy fell asleep!He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

159
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
Or call an ambulance!

160
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
What did the doctor say?Any news on when the baby will come?

161
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
No. She gave us ideason how to induce labor.

162
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
We tried them all.

163
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
We went for a walk, we tried tea,castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.

164
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
There is one thing we didn't try.

165
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
But someone thinks thatthat will open up a can of worms.

166
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
If it's gonna helpbring the baby here, today...

167
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
...I think you should do it.

168
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
- It's sex.- Do it!

169
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
- Monica.- It's been a really long time for you.

170
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
I mean, women have needs.Do it. Get yours.

171
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
Oh, I don't know about that.

172
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
I think if the two of you had sex, therepercussions would be catastrophic.

173
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
All right, let's be practical.

174
00:11:28 --> 00:11:33
If Ross isn't willing, he's notthe only guy you can have sex with.

175
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
You could borrow Chandler.Chandler is good.

176
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
Monica, what is the matter with you?

177
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
- I just want the baby to be born today.- Why today?

178
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
Okay, fine.

179
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
I bet Phoebe that you're gonna havethe baby, and I don't want to lose.

180
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
What? While she's been going throughthis hell, you've been making money?

181
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
You're betting on your friendstaying in this misery?

182
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
- I'll take that bet.- What?

183
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
I'm miserable. I may as wellmake some money out of it.

184
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
Can I get some of that action?

185
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
I'm betting against all of you?

186
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
I really feel liketomorrow it's gonna happen.

187
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
Okay.

188
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

189
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
Where have you been?I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.

190
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
Oh, no. Were you upset?Did you lose sleep?

191
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
I'm so sorry.

192
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
The reason I came over isto settle things between us.

193
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
I wanted to pay you backwith the premiere, but you missed it.

194
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
- So how much do I owe you?- What?

195
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
- I don't want to owe you anything.- You don't owe me.

196
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
- I don't want your...- We're doing this!

197
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
You got me my first headshots.How much?

198
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
- I don't know, $500.- Okay, $500. What else?

199
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
Then there was the second set.The infamous "booger" headshots.

200
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
Okay, so that's another $500.That's 500 and 500. That's...

201
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
- You want a calculator?- Please.

202
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
Here.

203
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
All right, what else?

204
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
Well, there's acting classes,stage-combat classes, tap classes...

205
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
Which we're still keepingunder our hats.

206
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
That dialect coach who helped youwith a Southern accent.

207
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
Which, after 20 hours of lessons,still came out Jamaican.

208
00:13:25 --> 00:13:30
What the hell are you talking about?The South will rise again, man.

209
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
Yes, money well-spent.

210
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
Okay, what else? Rent.

211
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
Two, three years of rent,utilities, food...

212
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
Okay, so I'm writing youa check for...

213
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
So you fell asleep during my movie.Big deal, right?

214
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
How do you clear this thing?

215
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
Finish your enchilada.

216
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.It's not working.

217
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

218
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

219
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
By the way, you don't want to touchthe pepper and then touch your eye.

220
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
I am feeling nothing.

221
00:14:20 --> 00:14:23
Speaking of hot,watching you do that...

222
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
...really makes me wantto have sex with you.

223
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
- Stop it.- Come on! Why are we wasting time?

224
00:14:29 --> 00:14:33
We know it's gonna work.It's doctor-recommended.

225
00:14:33 --> 00:14:38
I'm sorry. But we have to havesome boundaries. My God, I'm dying.

226
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
We've done it before.We'll do it again.

227
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
It'll be a nice wayto bookend the pregnancy.

228
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
I'm not gonna make love to youso you'll go into labor.

229
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
Make love? What are you, a girl?

230
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
Always a great way to getinto a man's pants.

231
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
You'll be performing a service.Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

232
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
Sometimes, you have to bang onthe end of it to get it to come out.

233
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
I love when you talk dirty to me.

234
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
I know it. You're right.That's not sexy.

235
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.

236
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
Let me just bend over and get it.

237
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
Oh, God!

238
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
Okay, enough.This is not going to happen.

239
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.

240
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
Come on, you started this,now you finish it!

241
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.

242
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
- You know what?- What?

243
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
Forget it.

244
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
What now, Ross,you're not gonna talk?

245
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
How on earth will you ever annoy me?

246
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

247
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
You'd think the jalapeno wouldclear up your sinuses, but no!

248
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
That's not enough...What are you doing?

249
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
I'm getting that baby out of you!

250
00:16:08 --> 00:16:09
- Oh, God!- I know.

251
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
Oh, no, no, no.

252
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
I think my water just broke.

253
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
I am good!

254
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
Okay, I got the pillow.I got the bag.

255
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
- You got the keys?- I got the keys.

256
00:16:28 --> 00:16:29
We're having a baby.

257
00:16:40 --> 00:16:44
I didn't have time to read this partof the books, but do we have time...?

258
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
- Not so much.- Okay, let's go.

259
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
- 200.- Thank you.

260
00:16:51 --> 00:16:55
That's it. I don't care whenthe baby comes. No more betting.

261
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
Hello?

262
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
I guess we could betone more time.

263
00:17:07 --> 00:17:10
- Is Rachel having the baby?- How did you know that?

264
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
- Joey! Chandler!- They're at the coffee house.

265
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
You know everything!

266
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
Wait. I bet you the babyis over 7 pounds.

267
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
I bet you it has hair!I bet you it's a girl.

268
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
- We know it's a girl.- I'll give you really good odds.
