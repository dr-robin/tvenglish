1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
Oh, that feels so good.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
Oh, lucky me.Coffee and a live sex show.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
- I'm sorry, what?- I'm sorry.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
- Nothing. I was just reading to Emma.- From "Cosmo"?

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Yeah. Yeah, it's:

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
"Climax Your Way to Better Skin."

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
So I have to go shopping today,which is my least favorite thing.

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
I'm so bad at picking out clothes.

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
So you need someone who knowsfashion to tell you what looks good.

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
Not me. Not me. Not me.

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
- Oh, hey, Rach?- Yeah?

12
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
- Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?- Oh, well...

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
- I'm sure you have better things to do.- You kidding?

14
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
Rachel loves to shop,and she has great taste.

15
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
She's the one that taught me notto wear white after Labor Day...

16
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
...and to always, always, always puton underwear when trying on clothes.

17
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
If you have the time,I'd really appreciate the help.

18
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
Okay. Yeah, let's shop.

19
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
Okay, you are gonna come backwith some very classy clothes.

20
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!

21
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
Okay, great. All right, bye.

22
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
Pain in the ass!

23
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
- That's off, right?- What's the matter, Pheebs?

24
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
Mike's sister just invited me toa party tonight and he's gonna be there.

25
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
She was like, "Don't worry. I asked himand he's totally okay with seeing you."

26
00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
So now I have to go so he'll thinkthat I'm totally okay with seeing him.

27
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
- Which you're not. You're hung up on him.- Exactly.

28
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
You want him to eat his heart out,so you have to look fabulous.

29
00:01:22 --> 00:01:24
I didn't even think about that.

30
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
Sexual politics!

31
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
Pheebs, I'm taking Charlie shopping.

32
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
- Come and I'll help you find something.- That'd be great.

33
00:01:31 --> 00:01:36
Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,trying on slutty lingerie together.

34
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
- That's not what we're gonna do.- Why'd you ruin it? Who was I hurting?

35
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
The One With The Donor

38
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
Fortunately, she hasa very pretty face.

39
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
I still can't believe this. My uterus isan inhospitable environment?

40
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
I've always tried so hardto be a good hostess.

41
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
I can't believe my spermhave low motility.

42
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
While I was growing up, they sureseemed to be in a hurry to get places.

43
00:02:34 --> 00:02:35
- Hi there.- Hi.

44
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
I'm sorry there wasn't better newsfrom your tests last week...

45
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
...but I wanted to talk to youabout your options.

46
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
Okay.

47
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
Even though your chances of conceivingthrough natural means aren't great...

48
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
...you never know,so keep having sex on a regular basis.

49
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
Oh, damn it!

50
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
Don't worry.After a while, you'll tune it out.

51
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
Given your situation, the optionswith the greatest chances for success...

52
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
...would be surrogacyor insemination using a sperm donor.

53
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
If you feel that neither of those isright for you, you could always adopt.

54
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
Is that a hint?

55
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly,but we don't want you to be our child.

56
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
Wow! Talk aboutan inhospitable environment.

57
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick upPhoebe and go shopping?

58
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
- Let's do it.- All right, have a good time.

59
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Not gonna find any clothes in there.

60
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
- Hey, you guys.- Hi.

61
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
Guess who's up for keynote speakerat the National Paleontology Conference?

62
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
- Chris Bailey?- Yeah, right.

63
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
When was the last time he madea submission deadline for an abstract?

64
00:03:41 --> 00:03:42
Why are you laughing?

65
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
Just seeing what it'd be liketo be a paleontologist.

66
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
It's fun. Yeah.

67
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
So you're up for keynote speaker?

68
00:03:49 --> 00:03:50
- Who's deciding?- Professor Sherman.

69
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
- I'm meeting with him today.- He's a pretty tough guy to impress.

70
00:03:54 --> 00:03:55
I think I know how to dazzle him.

71
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
You're not gonna to doa magic trick, are you?

72
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
No.

73
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
- Hey, guys.- I want to ask you something.

74
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
I may get to speakat this paleontology convention.

75
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
If I do, I'd love for you guysto come and hear me.

76
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
I think I can safely say that we all havefamily issues, work and/or are sick.

77
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
- It's in Barbados.- But you come first.

78
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
I'm there.

79
00:04:24 --> 00:04:25
- We'll see you guys.- Bye.

80
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
See you.

81
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
- So how did it go at the fertility clinic?- Not as much fun as last time.

82
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
Apparently, you only get pornif you're giving a sperm sample.

83
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
So, what did the doctor say?

84
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamther whole life of carrying a child...

85
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
...and she just felt that watchinga surrogate would be too hard for her.

86
00:04:43 --> 00:04:44
- So you're ruling out surrogacy?- Yeah.

87
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
So I don't have to learnwhat that means?

88
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
Aside from adoption, the onlyother choice is insemination...

89
00:04:50 --> 00:04:51
...so we're talking about sperm donors.

90
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
Enough said. I'm there for you, man.Where is she, upstairs?

91
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
How do you feel about all this?

92
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
I wish there was an easier way for usto have a child, but there isn't one.

93
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
Come on, Ross, be a good guy.Step up and do it.

94
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
What?

95
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
What?! No!I'm not gonna give them Ben!

96
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
The data we're receivingfrom MRI scans and DNA testing...

97
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
...of these fossils are staggering.

98
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
I mean, we've been acceptingLeakey's dates as a given.

99
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
But if they're offby even a 100,000 years or so...

100
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
...then you can just throwmost of our assumptions...

101
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
...you know, right in the trash.

102
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
So, what I'm saying is...

103
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
Is that...

104
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
Is that repercussions could be huge.

105
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
I mean, not just in paleontology,but if you think about it...

106
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
...in evolutionary biology,genetics, geology.

107
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
I mean, truly, the mind boggles.

108
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
Well, that's not what you want.

109
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
- Incentive for Men?- I'll take some of that.

110
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
- Pheebs, that's for men.- I know.

111
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
When I go to the party later...

112
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
...Mike will know I'm over himbecause I'll smell like another guy.

113
00:06:09 --> 00:06:10
Okay.

114
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Oh, good, I'm datinga Russian cabdriver.

115
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
Seriously, does anyone buy this?I smell like beets.

116
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
I really like those jackets with theshoulder pads in them. Where are those?

117
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
On Melanie Griffith in "Working Girl".

118
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
I think what you want is over here.

119
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
See, I told you I needed someone.

120
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
By the way, as a thank you,I would really love to take you out.

121
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
- Really?- Joey and I are going to a movie tonight.

122
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
- You want to come?- Oh, I can't.

123
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
Because I've seen them.

124
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
You've seen all the movies?

125
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
Yeah. I'm a big fan.

126
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
Of the movies.

127
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
You know, motion pictures.

128
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
The talkies.

129
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
Rach, will you come with meto a dressing room?

130
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
- Sure.- Okay.

131
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Maybe we could do something else.

132
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
You know, that depends on what it is.I've done a lot of stuff.

133
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
So, what were you doing out there?Do you not like Charlie?

134
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
She's okay. I don't know, I just don'tget a really good vibe from her.

135
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
- Why?- I don't know.

136
00:07:15 --> 00:07:20
You know, just the wayshe waltzed in here all smart...

137
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
...and tall, you know...

138
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
...and just swept Joey off his feet.Nobody else has a chance.

139
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
Who else?

140
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Anybody.

141
00:07:28 --> 00:07:28
You.

142
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
Me.

143
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
You know, Monica's mom.

144
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
You like Joey?!

145
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
Phoebe!

146
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
All right, look, I do.I have a little thing for him. Just...

147
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
- Oh, my God.- It's just physical.

148
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
I have it totally under control, okay?It's just when I see them together...

149
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
...sometimes, I just get a little jealous.

150
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Wow. Isn't that ironicthat he liked you, and now you like...?

151
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
I get it!

152
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
All right, as longas it's under control.

153
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
You can't do anything about it.He's already dating her.

154
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
She is a nice person.That wouldn't be right.

155
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
I know, I know.So it's just not a big deal.

156
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
- So can we keep this between us?- Sure.

157
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
Great, because I gotta get out of here.The smell of beets is killing me.

158
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?

159
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
- Hi, honey.- Hey.

160
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
I brought a friend home for dinner.This is Zack from work.

161
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
Oh, of course. It's so niceto see you again, Zack.

162
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
- You too.- You guys haven't actually met before.

163
00:08:28 --> 00:08:29
But, boy, you're both polite.

164
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
Have a seat. I'll get you a beer.

165
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
- I got it.- Thanks.

166
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
- So Zack's pretty nice, huh?- Yeah, I guess.

167
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
So how would you like to have a babythat's half yours and half his?

168
00:08:45 --> 00:08:45
Excuse me?

169
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
We're talking about sperm donors,and Zack may be the guy.

170
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,he's athletic. I mean, he's sperm-tastic!

171
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
Chandler, this is crazy.Well, what did you even say to him?

172
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
"Come up. Meet my wife.Give us your sperm."

173
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
I invited him to dinner so you'd geta chance to get to know him.

174
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
With a sperm bank, you nevermeet the guy, get to check him out.

175
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
- Chandler!- I'm telling you, he's great.

176
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
I mean, even if my sperm worked fine,I think he'd be the way to go.

177
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
I'm not going to be a part of this.

178
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
You can't bring some random guy homeand expect him to be our sperm donor.

179
00:09:18 --> 00:09:19
Okay.

180
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
- Zack?- Thanks.

181
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
Do you have a coaster?I don't want to make a ring.

182
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
Tell me about yourself, Zack.

183
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
Oh, God, do you think she heard?Lt'd be so bad if she heard.

184
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
Maybe she didn't hear. I'll go into thatdressing room and talk. You stay here.

185
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
- See if you can hear me.- Okay, great.

186
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
Oh, thank God,I can't hear a word that you're saying.

187
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
- I didn't say anything yet.- Well, get back in there and talk.

188
00:09:48 --> 00:09:48
I'm Rachel.

189
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
It's so annoying when I put Emmaon the phone to talk with my friends.

190
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
What?

191
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
Well, some things are just hardto say to your face.

192
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
Okay, well, I heard that.Which means that she heard it too.

193
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
- We have a problem.- Oh, what are we gonna do?

194
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
Just be honest with her.

195
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
Oh, my God!

196
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
It is annoying when parentsput babies on the phone.

197
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
All right, enough out of you!

198
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
- Hello?- I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?

199
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
No, she went shopping with Rachel.Why? What's up?

200
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
I'm meeting with Professor Shermanabout my being the keynote speaker.

201
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
- How's it going?- It could be better.

202
00:10:29 --> 00:10:30
He fell asleep.

203
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
What? But I already boughtmy ticket to Bermuda!

204
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
- Barbados.- Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.

205
00:10:37 --> 00:10:38
You have to get that job.

206
00:10:39 --> 00:10:40
What am I supposed to do?He's out cold.

207
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
In fact, he was just talkingin his sleep before...

208
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
...and evidently he wants someonenamed Fran to "spank him harder."

209
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
- Well, just wake him up.- I can't.

210
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
If he realizes that I'm the one whoput him to sleep, I won't get the job.

211
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
That's a tough one.

212
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
Oh, wait a minute.This happened to me before.

213
00:10:57 --> 00:11:01
Yeah, I was auditioning for a play,and the producer fell asleep. L...

214
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
No, wait a minute.

215
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
It was me who fell asleep.

216
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
I mean, hey, Shakespeare, how abouta chase scene once in a while?

217
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.- I'm gonna go wash up first.

218
00:11:14 --> 00:11:14
Thanks.

219
00:11:17 --> 00:11:21
What do you think? I want his genesfor my kid. Those eyes, those cheekbones.

220
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
Okay, there's enthusiastic,and there's just plain gay.

221
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
- You don't like him.- I think he's fine.

222
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
But we don't knowanything real about him.

223
00:11:29 --> 00:11:33
- I wish we could get more information.- All right, just follow my lead.

224
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
- You guys have a great place here.- Thanks. I'm crazy about our place.

225
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
Hey, speaking of crazy...

226
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
...do you have a historyof mental illness in the family?

227
00:11:42 --> 00:11:46
No. Although, I did have an unclewho voted for Dukakis.

228
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
That's really not the kind of thingwe're looking for.

229
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
Okay.

230
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
So tell me, how'd you guys meet?

231
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
Oh, friends first, drunk in London,you know the story.

232
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
I've got a better question for you:

233
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
Do you or any of your blood relativeshave diabetes?

234
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
No.

235
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
Heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?

236
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
You guys don't have peoplefor dinner a lot, huh?

237
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
We're just making conversation.

238
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
Yeah, well, okay.I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny.

239
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
You know what's not funny?Male pattern baldness.

240
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
You guys have shown a lot of interestin me tonight, and I'm flattered...

241
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
...and quite frankly, a little frightened.

242
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
Can we just talk about something else?

243
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
- Sure.- All right.

244
00:12:31 --> 00:12:32
This ravioli's delicious.

245
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
I notice you're enjoying that ravioliwith a beautiful set of teeth.

246
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Did you have braces as a child?

247
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
- No, I didn't.- Yes!

248
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
We're teeth people, Zack.

249
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
Let's just do it. Let's just goover there and see if she heard.

250
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
- Good plan.- Okay.

251
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
- What? Where are you going?- Oh, I'm sorry, Rachel.

252
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
I don't have timefor your childish games, okay?

253
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
I still have to find somethingincredible to wear...

254
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
...so I can beat Mikeat "Who's More Over Who"!

255
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
- Where have you been?- Trying on clothes.

256
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
Oh, really? In the dressing room?Well, that's so weird.

257
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
Phoebe and I were in the dressing room.Gosh, it's just such a small world.

258
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
Rachel, I heard youtwo guys whispering.

259
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
Oh, God, you did, you heard.Okay, look, let me explain.

260
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
There's nothing to explain.I heard you.

261
00:13:25 --> 00:13:26
Phoebe likes Joey.

262
00:13:30 --> 00:13:31
Yeah.

263
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
I don't understand it.I mean, Phoebe likes Joey...

264
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
...and then she's here to buy a dressto impress another guy?

265
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41
Yeah, that's Phoebe. That's Phoebe.You know, she just wants them all.

266
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
It's, like, she's nympho.

267
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
- Wow!- Yeah.

268
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
You know, by the way, I heard youtell her not to do anything.

269
00:13:49 --> 00:13:53
Thanks for sticking up for me.God, you are such a nice person.

270
00:13:54 --> 00:13:55
I try.

271
00:14:25 --> 00:14:29
Oh, my God, you really want meto be the keynote speaker?

272
00:14:30 --> 00:14:31
Thank you!

273
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
You're welcome.

274
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
Wow! You look...

275
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
...stop-eating hot!

276
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
Which is like the highest levelof hotness.

277
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
Okay, are you sure? Because I amreally dreading going to this party.

278
00:14:56 --> 00:14:57
Then don't go.

279
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
Mike knows I'm coming. If I don'tshow up, he'll think it's because of him...

280
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
...and then I'm gonna lose face.That's a very serious thing in my culture.

281
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
All right, then you go to that party,and you pretend to be over Mike.

282
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
Afterward, you come to my placeand I'll get you good and drunk.

283
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
You got it. Okay.

284
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
But not on the winethat you made, okay?

285
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
Because I just don't want to go backto the emergency room.

286
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
David?

287
00:15:27 --> 00:15:28
Phoebe! Hi.

288
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
- Oh, my God!- Hi.

289
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
Wow! You look unbelievable.

290
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
Oh, yeah, well...

291
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
What are you doing here?

292
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
Well, I'm back from Minsk.Permanently.

293
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
Well, what happened?

294
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
Remember how I was tryingto achieve...

295
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
...the positronic distillationof subatomic particles?

296
00:15:45 --> 00:15:46
Yeah.

297
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
Well, after eight years of research,I discovered...

298
00:15:49 --> 00:15:51
...that it can't be done.

299
00:15:52 --> 00:15:53
Well...

300
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
...great that you're back. How are you?

301
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
- Good. Good. Life is good.- Good.

302
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
Well, I'm seeing someone.

303
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
- Good for you.- Yeah.

304
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
She's also a scientist,so she's very smart and pretty and...

305
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
It's actually because of youthat we're together.

306
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
I mean, I saw what you hadwith that Mike guy...

307
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
...and I just said, "Boy, I want that."

308
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
- Mike and I broke up.- You're kidding me.

309
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
Because I'm not seeing anybody.I just totally made that up.

310
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
- Really?- I don't know why, I'm sorry.

311
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
I guess I just didn't wantto lose face.

312
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
I understand.

313
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
Yeah. Okay. So then, okay...

314
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
So we're both living in New York,not seeing anyone.

315
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
- That's so not like us.- Yeah, I know.

316
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
Well, this is probably a stupid question,seeing that you look like that...

317
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
...but do you have someplacethat you need to be right now?

318
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
Well...

319
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
No.

320
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
- Well, do you want to get a drink?- I'd love to.

321
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
- Great.- Okay.

322
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
Do you smell beets?

323
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
All right, stay upwind of me.

324
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
Hey, there's Phoebe.Is that Mike she's with?

325
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
No, that's David.

326
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
There's a third guy?

327
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
Tip of the iceberg.

328
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
I'm gonna take off now.

329
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
You're gonna let me go home,aren't you?

330
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
Sure you don't want to staya little longer?

331
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
No, I should get home.I'm kind of tired.

332
00:17:15 --> 00:17:16
Are you always tired?

333
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
Because that could bea sign of clinical depression.

334
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
No, it's tiring to figure out the ageat which all my grandparents died.

335
00:17:24 --> 00:17:25
- I'll see you tomorrow.- Okay.

336
00:17:25 --> 00:17:26
Bye.

337
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
I think we found our sperm.

338
00:17:30 --> 00:17:31
He does seem pretty perfect.

339
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
Yeah? You think so?Should I ask him?

340
00:17:35 --> 00:17:36
No.

341
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
Why not? Just because hisgreat-grandmother was obese?

342
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
Our kid's gonna get thatfrom you anyway.

343
00:17:43 --> 00:17:44
No, that's not it.

344
00:17:44 --> 00:17:48
It's just that when we were asking himall those questions before...

345
00:17:48 --> 00:17:52
...I just realized I don't care if heis the most perfect guy in the world.

346
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
- He's not you.- Yeah, he's better!

347
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
No, he's not.

348
00:17:58 --> 00:18:02
If I can't get pregnant with you, thenI don't want to get pregnant by him...

349
00:18:02 --> 00:18:03
...or anyone else.

350
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
- Really? Are you sure?- Yeah, I'm sure.

351
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
Thank God, because Idon't wanna do this either.

352
00:18:09 --> 00:18:12
I was just doing it because I thoughtthat was what you wanted.

353
00:18:12 --> 00:18:15
I'm the husband.I'm supposed to bring the sperm.

354
00:18:16 --> 00:18:17
That is so sweet.

355
00:18:18 --> 00:18:19
I love you.

356
00:18:22 --> 00:18:23
So you know this leaves us with...

357
00:18:24 --> 00:18:25
Adoption.

358
00:18:26 --> 00:18:27
How do you feel about that?

359
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
I think I feel okay about it.

360
00:18:31 --> 00:18:33
Actually, I think I feelreally good about it.

361
00:18:34 --> 00:18:35
Me too.

362
00:18:35 --> 00:18:39
I wanna find a baby that needs a home,and I wanna raise it with you.

363
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
And I wanna mess it upin our own specific way.

364
00:18:43 --> 00:18:46
So this is it?We're really gonna adopt?

365
00:18:47 --> 00:18:48
Yeah.

366
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
- Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!- We are gonna be great parents.

367
00:18:52 --> 00:18:53
And it could be soon.

368
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
I mean, think about it.Right now, somewhere out there...

369
00:18:56 --> 00:18:58
...our baby could be being conceived.

370
00:18:58 --> 00:19:01
Wait. If we're lucky,and we're really, really, really quiet...

371
00:19:02 --> 00:19:04
...we may be able to hearthe sound of a condom breaking.

372
00:19:09 --> 00:19:10
Hey, Zack.

373
00:19:10 --> 00:19:12
Hey, Chandler.

374
00:19:12 --> 00:19:13
I wanted to apologize for last night.

375
00:19:13 --> 00:19:15
I got the feelingwe made you uncomfortable.

376
00:19:16 --> 00:19:16
- No, you didn't.- Really?

377
00:19:17 --> 00:19:18
No, you did.

378
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
My wife and I havesome boundary issues.

379
00:19:20 --> 00:19:22
Sometimes we askinappropriate questions.

380
00:19:22 --> 00:19:23
We're working on it.

381
00:19:24 --> 00:19:26
- Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.- Thank you.

382
00:19:28 --> 00:19:31
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planningon keeping her baby, would you?

383
00:19:37 --> 00:19:38
