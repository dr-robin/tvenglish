Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
You should see the sizeof his Christmas balls!

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
How much did you tip the super?

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
We were gonna give 50,but we don't wanna look bad.

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
This year we made him cookies.

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
And 25 it is.

9
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
You gave cookies?

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
Money is so impersonal.

11
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
Cookies says someone cares.

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
We're broke,but cookies do say that.

13
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
I can see that.

14
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

15
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
Pheebs, let me ask you something.Were these "funny" brownies?

16
00:00:40 --> 00:00:41
Not especially.

17
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
But I think they had pot in them.

18
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
So who else did you tipwith cookies?

19
00:00:49 --> 00:00:51
The mailman, the super...

20
00:00:51 --> 00:00:54
And the newspaper delivery guy.

21
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
Oh, my God.

22
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
What?

23
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
You're not gonna like this.

24
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
These are cookies smashedto the sports section.

25
00:01:04 --> 00:01:05
He did my crossword puzzle.

26
00:01:05 --> 00:01:09

32
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
...Iords are a-leapingand geese are a-laying.

33

Everyone knows it's...

42
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
Just a big spring.

43
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
You're still madbecause of the whole...

44
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
Horrible list of reasonsnot to be with me?

45
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
How about we just call itthe "unfortunate incident"?

46
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
Hey, Gunther.You got stairs in your place?

47
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39

51
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47

This is a picture framefrom Ben to my parents.

00:03:09 --> 00:03:10
Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...

60
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14

63
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
Macy's, third floor,home furnishings.

64
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
This is my father!

65
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
This is a picture of my dad!

66
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
That's the guythat comes in the frame.

67
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
No, it's my dad.I'll show you.

68
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
I thought your dad was in prison.

69
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
No, that's my stepdad.

70
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
My real dad's the one thatran out on us before I was born.

71
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
How have you never been on "Oprah"?

72
00:03:41 --> 00:03:42
Look, see? This is him.

73
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
My mother gave me this picturebefore she died. Same guy!

74
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
This is a picture of the frame guy...

75
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
...posing in front ofa blue screen with a collie.

76
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
It's not a blue screen.It's just...

77
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
Maybe it was justreally clear that day.

78
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Okay, I have to talkto my grandmother.

79
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
Wait a minute, honey!

80
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
I'm trying to get my boss'sex-wife to sleep with me.

81
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
But when Phoebe has a problem,everyone's all ears!

82
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
Esther Livingston.

83
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
Gone!

84
00:04:23 --> 00:04:24
Hi, Pooh.

85
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
Hi, Gram. What you doing?

86
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
Just updating the phone book.

87
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
Gram?

88
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
Can I see the picturesof my dad again?

89
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
Sure, sure.

90
00:04:37 --> 00:04:37
How come?

91
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Just, you know, to see him.

92
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Sure. Here.

93
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
This is the oneof your father in a meadow.

94
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
And helping a little boy fly a kite.

95
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
And here he is at a graduation.

96
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Another graduation.

97
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
Another graduation.

98
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
Is this really my father?

99
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
Is it really your fa...?

100
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
Well, of course it is.

101
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
I smell smoke. Maybe becausesomeone's pants are on fire!

102
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
In all the years we've beengrandmother and granddaughter...

103
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
...you've never lied.

104
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
All right, that's not your father.It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

105
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
Oh, God.

106
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
It was your mother's idea.

107
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
She didn't want youto know your real father...

108
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
...because he hurt her so much.

109
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
I didn't want to do it.

110
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
But then she diedand it was harder to argue with her.

111
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Not impossible, but harder.

112
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40
All right. So he's nota famous tree surgeon?

113
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
And I guess he doesn't live in a hutin Burma where there's no phones?

114
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
Last I heard, he wasa pharmacist somewhere upstate.

115
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
That makes no sense.

116
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
Why would the villagersworship a pharmacist?

117
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
Honey.

118
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
Anyway, that's all I know.

119
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
That...

120
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
...and this.

121
00:06:10 --> 00:06:11
This...

122
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
...is the real him.

123
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
I remember my fatherall dressed up in the red suit...

124
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
...the big black bootsand the patent leather belt...

125
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
...sneaking around downstairs.He didn't want us to see him...

126
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
...but he'd be drunk, so he'd crashinto something and wake everybody up.

127
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
That doesn't sound likea very merry Christmas.

128
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Who said anything about Christmas?

129
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

130
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
No, nothing.

131
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
I hope she's okay.

132
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
I know exactlywhat she's going through.

133
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
How do you know that?

134
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
She told us.

135
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
What do you got there, Monica?

136
00:06:50 --> 00:06:50
Stuff for the party.

137
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
Aren't you guyssupposed to be shopping?

138
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
You didn't buy presents yet?

139
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!What are you gonna do?

140
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
Don't you have to beClaymation to say that?

141
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
I don't think the mailmanliked your cookies.

142
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
The ornaments your mom sent.

143
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.We just didn't give him enough.

144
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

145
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
Hey, Rach.

146
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
I think I know what willmake you feel better.

147
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
How about you make a list about me?

148
00:07:27 --> 00:07:28
Forget it.I'm not gonna stand here...

149
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
...and make a list...

150
00:07:30 --> 00:07:31
Okay, you're whiny...

151
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
...you are obsessive,you are insecure...

152
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
...you're gutless.

153
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
You don't ever just "seize the day".

154
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
You liked me for a yearand you didn't do anything about it.

155
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
And you wear too muchof that gel in your hair.

156
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
See, there...

157
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
All right, you did what I said.

158
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
And you know what?You're right. I do feel better.

159
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
Thank you, Ross.

160
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
Yeah, in Albany. Could I havethe number of Frank Buffay?

161
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
Okay. In lthaca?

162
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
All right, Saratoga?

163
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
Oneonta?

164
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
You know what? You shouldn'tcall yourself Information!

165
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
Hello, Grandma. If that is,in fact, your real name.

166
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
Come on now, Pooh.Don't still be mad at me.

167
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
- How's it going?- Not so good.

168
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
Upstate's pretty big.He's pretty small. You do the math.

169
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
Well, I think you'rebetter off without him.

170
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

171
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
But to me, he's stillthe irresponsible creep...

172
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
...who locked up your momand stole her Gremlin.

173
00:08:43 --> 00:08:48
I know. I just wanted to knowwho he was, you know?

174
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
Yeah, I know.

175
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
I wasn't completely honest with youwhen I said I didn't know...

176
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
...exactly where he lived.

177
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
What do you mean?

178
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
He lives at 74 Laurel Drivein Middletown.

179
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
If you hit the Dairy Queen,you've gone too far.

180
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
You can take my cab.

181
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
Thank you.

182
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
- Nobody else drives that cab.- Got it.

183
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
I'm gonna see my dad!

184
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
Thank you.

185
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

186
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

187
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

188
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
Hop in!

189
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
She'd better get here.The stores close at 7.

190
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
It'll be two hoursto Phoebe's dad's house...

191
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
...they'll meet, chat,swap life stories.

192
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
We'll have plenty of time.

193
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
Hey, here she comes!

194
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
Can you believe this?

195
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
In, like, two hoursI'm gonna have a dad.

196
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
Yeah, big stuff!

197
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
Okay, let's go!

198
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
Here, you have to hold this.

199
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
"Brake, left. Gas, right"?

200
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
That's my cheat sheet.

201
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
- Where's my seat belt?- There isn't one.

202
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
The paramedics had to cut through it.

203
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
Come on, just tell me.Please, please!

204
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
For the 16th time:No, I do not think you're obsessive!

205
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
- It's hot in here!- Rach, get the heat.

206
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
Ross, turn the heat down, please?

207
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
The difference between obsessive...

208
00:10:38 --> 00:10:39
Ross, the heat!

209
00:10:39 --> 00:10:44
Okay! Heat, heat, heat!And I'm the obsessive one?

210
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
This way is on.

211
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
So this is...

212
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
...off.

213
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
Did you just break the radiator?

214
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
No, I was turning the knob and...

215
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
...here it is.

216
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
Well, put it back!

217
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
It won't go back.

218
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
I'll call the super.

219
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
Here, let me try.

220
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
That's right. I forgot aboutyour ability to fuse metal.

221
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
Hey, it's Funny's cousin...

222
00:11:11 --> 00:11:12
...Not Funny!

223
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
Hi, Mr. Treeger?

224
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.

225
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
Yes, somebody broke our knobon the radiator...

226
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
...and it's really hot in here.

227
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
Yes, it's hot enoughto bake cookies.

228
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
Could we have a new one by 6?

229
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
Tuesday?We can't wait until Tuesday.

230
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
We're having a party tonight.

231
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
Okay, tip the man.

232
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
If he doesn't likeour cookies, too bad.

233
00:11:34 --> 00:11:35
I won't be blackmailed.

234
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
Look, if it gets a little warm...

235
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
...it can be a theme party.

236
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
Here's a theme:"Come on in, live like bacon!"

237
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
This is it!

238
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
Seventy-four.

239
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
So that's what this is for!

240
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
This is it.I'm gonna meet my dad.

241
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
This is likethe biggest thing ever.

242
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
Sure is.

243
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
Here I go. I'm going in.

244
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
All right!

245
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
Good luck, Pheebs.

246
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
Here I go.

247
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
Here I go.

248
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
I'm going.

249
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
Welcome to our tropicalChristmas party.

250
00:12:21 --> 00:12:25
Put your coats, sweaters,pants and shirts in the bedroom.

251
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
It's hard to tellbecause I'm sweating...

252
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
...but I use exactlywhat the gel bottle says.

253
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
An amount about the size of a pea.How can that be too much?

254
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
Ice?

255
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
Ice? Ice squares anyone?Take a napkin.

256
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
Monica!

257
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
Your guests are turning into jerky.

258
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
Really?I'm perfectly comfortable.

259
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
Hey! Get in line, buddy.I was next.

260
00:12:57 --> 00:12:58
Mr. Treeger.

261
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
You said there was a party.

262
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

263
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
Is it hot?My body always stays cool.

264
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
Probably because I have so much skin.

265
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
Hey, cheese!

266
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
Here's the chance.Monica, give him cash.

267
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
Rachel, give him your earrings.Something. Anything!

268
00:13:16 --> 00:13:17
No, I will not cave.

269
00:13:17 --> 00:13:18
I'm with Mon.

270
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
All right. You know how you sayI never seize the day?

271
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
Even though he's your super,I'm seizing.

272
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27

273
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30

275
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
Here's five back.

276
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
No, that's your Christmas tip.

277
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
Do you think there's a chanceyou can fix that radiator now?

278
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
No can do.Like I told the girl...

279
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

280
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
Ross?

281
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
He's playing baseball.

282
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
You mean hardball?

283
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
Whatever.

284

288
00:14:00 --> 00:14:01
Happy Hanukkah.

289
00:14:01 --> 00:14:05
Will this helpwith the knob-getting?

290
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
No, the place is not opentill Tuesday.

291
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
Am I not saying it right?

292
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
So you really did like my cookies?

293
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
Yeah, they were so personal.It really showed you cared.

294
00:14:20 --> 00:14:21
Nice seizing...

295
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
...gel boy.

296
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
Is this mistletoe?

297
00:14:30 --> 00:14:31
No, that...

298
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
That is basil.

299
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
If it was mistletoe,I was gonna kiss you.

300
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
No, it's still basil.

301
00:14:43 --> 00:14:48
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

302
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

303
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
- How far did you get?- Mailbo x.

304
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
All right, we're getting closer.

305
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
What's going on?

306
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
It's just likea whole mess of stuff.

307
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
Like yesterday, my dad wasthis famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

308
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
And you know, now he'sa pharmacist guy and...

309
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
Well, maybe he's thisreally cool pharmacist guy.

310
00:15:13 --> 00:15:17
Yeah, maybe!And I'll knock on the door...

311
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
...and he'll hug me,and I'll have a dad!

312
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
I'll go to his pharmacy andeveryone will be nice to me...

313
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
...because, you know,I'm Frank's daughter.

314
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
So why not go knock?

315
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
Because, I mean, what ifhe's not this great-dad guy?

316
00:15:34 --> 00:15:39
What if he's still the dirtbagwho ran out on my mom and us?

317
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
You know what?

318
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
I've already losta fake dad this week.

319
00:15:46 --> 00:15:50
I don't think I'm readyto lose a real one.

320
00:15:50 --> 00:15:55
Pheebs, that's okay.You took a big step today.

321
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
Someday, when you're ready,you'll make it past the hedges.

322
00:15:59 --> 00:16:02
And when you do,he'll be lucky to have you.

323
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
You guys...

324
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
Sorry about your shopping.

325
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
Oh, that's okay.We'll figure something out.

326
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
I know you're not going in there...

327
00:16:14 --> 00:16:18
...but you think it's okayif I go in and use his bathroom?

328
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
That's fine, never mind.

329
00:16:21 --> 00:16:22
Cool, snow!

330
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
Kind of like a blank canvas.

331
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap,is it hot in here!

332
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
You mind if I turn the heat down?

333
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
We could have usedthat kind of thinking earlier!

334
00:16:41 --> 00:16:42
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

335
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
Oh, I couldn't go in.

336
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
- Honey, I'm sorry.- Are you okay?

337
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
Yeah, it's okay,because I know he's there.

338
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
So that's enough for now.

339
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
Hey, it's after midnight!Merry Christmas, everyone!

340
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

341
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
The knob was broken...

342
00:16:58 --> 00:17:02
...so I turned it off from underneath.I hope that's all right.

343
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
Rach, these are for you.

344
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
Wiper blades!

345
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
I don't even have a car.

346
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
No, but with this new-car smell,you'll think you do!

347
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

348
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
Toilet-seat covers!

349
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
Is that what you didwhile I got gas?

350
00:17:34 --> 00:17:35
You guys!

351
00:17:36 --> 00:17:37
And for Ross...

352
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.

353
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
You got me a cola drink?

354
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
And a lemon-lime!

355
00:17:47 --> 00:17:52
Well, this is too much! I feel likeI should get you another sweater.

356
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
And last, but not least...

357
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
They're ribbed for your pleasure!
