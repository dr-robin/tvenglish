1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:03
Hey, I got you a present!

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
Oh, my, where did you hide it?

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
I ordered it for your weddingand it's finally here!

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
You didn't have to get us anything...

5
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it!

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
- It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!- Oh, my God!

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
I didn't know where to put it.

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
- We can put it in the guest bedroom.- Yeah, okay.

9
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
I kind of like it here.

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
Do you like it?

11
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
I practically spent myentire childhood at the arcade.

12
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
- This was my second favorite.- What's your first?

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
- I don't remember the name.- Well, what did it do?

14
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
You'd put a quarter in,pull some handles and win a candy bar.

15
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
A vending machine?

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
Don't feel bad for me.I won every time!

20
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
I'm so glad you guys are here.

21
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
Guess what happenedin the paleontology department.

22
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
Do you think he saw us,or can we still slip out?

23
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
Professor Newman, the department head,is retiring, so...

24
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
- They made you head of the department!- I'm teaching his advanced class!

25
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
Why didn't I get headof the department?

26
00:01:38 --> 00:01:42
Hey, Rach, I got a big date.Do you know a good restaurant?

27
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
Paul's Cafe. It's got great foodand it's really romantic.

28
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
Great, thanks.

29
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
Then take her to theFour Seasons for drinks.

30
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
Or go downtownand listen to some jazz.

31
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!

32
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
You sure are naminga lot of ways to postpone sex.

33
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
I miss dating. Dressing up,going to a fancy restaurant.

34
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
I won't be able to do that for so long.And it's so much fun.

35
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
Not that sitting aroundworrying about giving birth isn't fun.

36
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
Hey, you know what?Why don't I take you out?

37
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
You don't want to datea pregnant lady.

38
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
Yes, I do. We're gonnahave a good time.

39
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
I'll take your mind off of childbirth,and C-sections...

40
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
...and baby heads stretching out...

41
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
Okay, I'll go with you.

42
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
- It will be fun.- All right.

43
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
No, no! Yes!

44
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
Would you look at that.

45
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
I knocked off all your top scores.How sad.

46
00:02:37 --> 00:02:38
Okay, I'm next.

47
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
Don't start another game.I'm next! Phoebe?

48
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
Sorry, I couldn't hear youover all the winning.

49
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
- Phoebe's hogging the game.- It's a stupid game.

50
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
You think it's stupid becauseyou suck.

51
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
I don't suck. It sucks.

52
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
You suck.

53
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
If this game is gonna cause problems,I should keep it.

54
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
No, I love it. It is a great present.

55
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
Why don't you go home and waitfor the "Thank You" card?

56
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
- Why do you want to play this game?- It doesn't spit out a Clark Bar.

57
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
Okay. Phoebe, that's it.Out of the chair.

58
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
Joey, could you get that?

59
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
I thought you were in your room.

60
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
I'm picking you up for our date.For you.

61
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
Lilies. They're my favorite.Thank you.

62
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
And a brownie.

63
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
Well, half a brownie.

64
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
Actually, it's just a bag.

65
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
It's a long walk from the flower shopand I felt faint, so...

66
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
This is so great! I actually feellike I'm on a real date.

67
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
But I have morning sickness andI have on underwear that goes up to...

68
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
...there.

69
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Hey, come on. This is a real date.

70
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
So nice place you got here.

71
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
Foosball. Pizza box.

72
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
Oh, a subscription to "Playboy."My kind of woman.

73
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
That's my roommate's.

74
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
I'd like to meet him.He sounds like a standup guy.

75
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
He's protective of me,so you'd better watch yourself.

76
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
Your roommate, is he good-looking?

77
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
Must be tough to keep your handsoff him.

78
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
I'm pretty sure he's gay.

79
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
No! No, he's not! Why are you tryingto ruin the game?

80
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
Which brings us backto Greely's Theory of Dominance.

81
00:04:38 --> 00:04:39
That's it for today.

82
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
Does anyone know wherethe Freeman Building is?

83
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
It's the new building on Avenue A.

84
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
That's across town.I'm teaching there in 10 minutes.

85
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
Dude, that's not gonna happen.

86
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
Move it! Move it!

87
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Hey! I'm the teacher!

88
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
Hello.

89
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
Sorry I'm a little late.Whoa, a lot late.

90
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
Well, let me startby introducing myself.

91
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
I'm Professor Geller.

92
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
So to sum up...

93
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
...I'm Professor Geller.Good job today.

94
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
- What comes with the filet mignon?- Steamed vegetables.

95
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Instead of the vegetables...

96
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
...is there any way that I couldsubstitute the...

97
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
...three-pound lobster?

98
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
You know what? Bring her both.

99
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
And I'll have the same.

100
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
Wow, this is shaping upto be a pretty good date.

101
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
I almost forgot.I didn't pay you the rent.

102
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
No roommate stuff. It's a date.

103
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
Wow, so I get to see whatJoey Tribbiani is like on a date.

104
00:05:58 --> 00:05:59
Have any moves?

105
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
No, I'm just myself,and if they don't like me for...

106
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
I'm sorry, I couldn't evenget through that.

107
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
I knew it. Tell me your moves.

108
00:06:10 --> 00:06:11
All right.

109
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
Well...

110
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
I start by having a bottle of winesent to my table from a fan.

111
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
Oh, my God. And that works?

112
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
If you add, "This is embarrassing.I just want to have a normal life."

113
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
You poor little famous man.

114
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
Okay, how about this one?

115
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
I was gonna wait until the endof the night to kiss you...

116
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
...but you're just so beautiful,I don't think I can.

117
00:06:36 --> 00:06:37
Oh, my God!

118
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
Wow, that was fantastic!I almost leaned in. Really.

119
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
So tell me one of your moves.

120
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
All right.

121
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
So where'd you grow up?

122
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
That's your move?

123
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

124
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
- Come on, just answer the question.- Queens.

125
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
Were you close to your parents?

126
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
- With my mom. Not so much my dad.- Why not?

127
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
I don't know.There's just this distance.

128
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
We both try to pretend it's not there,but it is.

129
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
It's gotta be rough.

130
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
Yeah, it's really tough.Sometimes I think...

131
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
Wow!

132
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
Nice move!

133
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
- "Where'd you grow up?" So simple.- Thank you.

134
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
Now, excuse me.I'm gonna use the restroom.

135
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
- Now you're watching me walk away.- Yes, I am! So simple!

136
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
- You won't believe what I did today.- Clearly not shower or shave.

137
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
I played this all day,and now I rule.

138
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
They should change the nameto "Ms. Chandler."

139
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
Although, I hope they don't.

140
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
You stayed home and played Ms. Pac-Manwhile I went to work like a chump?

141
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
I got the top ten scores. I erasedPhoebe off the board. High-five!

142
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
What is the matter with your hand?

143
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
I played for eight hours.

144
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
It'll loosen up. Check out the scores.

145
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
Also, look at the initials.They're dirty words.

146
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
- Chandler, why would you do that?- Because it's awesome.

147
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
You think it's clever?

148
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
They only give you three letters,so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.

149
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
- This one's not dirty.- Put it together with that one.

150
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
Oh.

151
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
If you don't clear this off,you won't get one of those from me.

152
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
Ben's coming over.This can't be there.

153
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
- He won't know what they mean.- He's 7, not stupid.

154
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
- Have you talked to him lately?- I'm gonna unplug it.

155
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
I'll have nothing to show for my day.Like work.

156
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
No!

157
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
Hey, look! It's still there!

158
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
This thing must have some kindof primitive ROM chip!

159
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
- You gotta beat your scores.- With the claw?

160
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
Fine, I'll do it.We gotta get this off.

161
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
Carol's still upset thatyou taught him "Pull my finger."

162
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!

163
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
- I am not gonna answer that.- Oh, come on. Just pick one.

164
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
Between Monica, Phoebe,Chandler and Ross...

165
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
...if you had to,who would you punch?

166
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
We're friends.I wouldn't punch any of them.

167
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
Chandler?

168
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
Yeah, but I don't know why.

169
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
- I'm having a wonderful time!- Me too!

170
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
- This is the best date I ever had.- I know!

171
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
I laughed so hard. Did yousee the wine come out my nose?

172
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
Joey, I think everybody saw it.

173
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
I never knew I could enjoythe non-sex part of a date so much.

174
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
That's because you have neverbeen on a date with me before.

175
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
All right. Now don't judge me.

176
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
I normally wait till my date leaves,but I'm ripping into the swan.

177
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
Okay, then you don't judge me.

178
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
I'm gonna suck on the cellophanefrom that brownie.

179
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
So, what are Joey Tribbiani'send-of-the-night moves?

180
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
Well, if I want the girl to kiss me...

181
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
...first, I make my lipslook irresistible.

182
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
How do you do it?

183
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
Now you can't tell anyone, but...

184
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
...I put on shiny lip balm.

185
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
- Oh, my God.- Like a moth to a flame, I tell you.

186
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
- Okay, now you go.- No, I don't want to tell you.

187
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
- Why not?- It's embarrassing.

188
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
More embarrassing thanshiny raspberry lip balm?

189
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

190
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.

191
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
Okay.

192
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
All right, stand up.

193
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
Well, when we're at the door...

194
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
...I lightly press my lipsagainst his.

195
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
Then move into his body,just for a second.

196
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
And then I make this sound:

197
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
It doesn't sound like anything,but it works.

198
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.

199
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
All right, I gotta go to bed.I had such a wonderful time.

200
00:11:11 --> 00:11:12
Me too.

201
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
You were 50 minutes late?Did you crawl?

202
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
No, I ran, okay? It's really far.

203
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
When did people stop understanding"Get out of my way"?

204
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
Why didn't you take a cab?

205
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
With the traffic and one-way streets,it'd take me twice as long.

206
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
And I have class three times a week.Who am I, Rockefeller?

207
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
You won't be able to keep doing this.

208
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
If I don't, they'll take the classaway from me.

209
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
And I put it in my family newsletter.

210
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
- Your what?- You've seen it, "The Geller Yeller."

211
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
Right. Wow.

212
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
I figured out a faster route.I'm sure I can make it this time.

213
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
I just can't be afraidto get a little bit hit by cars.

214
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
- Hey.- Hi!

215
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
Remember when we talked about "Cujo"?

216
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
I can't believe you haven't seen "Cujo."

217
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
Relax, it isn't "Citizen Kane."

218
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
Have you ever sat through"Citizen Kane"?

219
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
Yeah, it's really boring.But it's, like, a big deal.

220
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
Anyway, I was thinkingabout renting "Cujo."

221
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
Well, let's do it tonight.

222
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
- Don't you have that big date?- Oh, right.

223
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
- Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?- Yeah.

224
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
After our date, did you feel weird?

225
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
Oh, my God. You did too?It freaked me out. What was that?

226
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
I don't know. I'm kind of thinkingit was the lobster.

227
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.

228
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
- I was up sick all night.- Me too. All night.

229
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
Really? We didn't cross paths.

230
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
Yeah, well, that's because...

231
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
...I stayed in my room.

232
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
You don't want to lookin my hamper.

233
00:13:03 --> 00:13:04
Okay, I got that.

234
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
I'll escape there.I'll come back here.

235
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.

236
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
Well, you're just a little bitch,aren't you?!

237
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
Hey, you guys?

238
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
I'm sorry that I washogging the game before.

239
00:13:20 --> 00:13:25
Oh, my God! Your friends havesome unfortunate initials.

240
00:13:25 --> 00:13:26
They're all Chandler.

241
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
Chandler couldn't get this good.

242
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
I did. But it came at a price.

243
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.

244
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
By age 7, kids havealready seen orgies.

245
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
Was it just me?

246
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

247
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
Okay, why don't we all...

248
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
...open our books to page 23...

249
00:14:03 --> 00:14:04
...where...

250
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
...where you will see...

251
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
...a bunch of red spots.

252
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
Okay, why don't you all start to readwhile I...

253
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
Are you all right?You seem a little distracted.

254
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
No, no, I'm fine. It's just...

255
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
Hey, can I ask you something?

256
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
Have you ever looked at someoneyou know...

257
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
...and suddenly seen themin a different way?

258
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
You mean like from behind?

259
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
Yeah. That's exactly it.

260
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
I saw this guy from behind,and he seemed totally normal.

261
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
And then he turned aroundand it was Stephen Baldwin!

262
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
So you know exactly what I mean.

263
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
Totally! Wow.

264
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
- Would you excuse me?- Sure.

265
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
- Phoebe! You're on fire!- I know!

266
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
You can do it!

267
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
- Don't touch me!- Don't touch her!

268
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
Go left! Go right! Go right!

269
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
I can't! I can't!

270
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
No! You son of a...

271
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
Phoebe?!

272
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
Oh, hi, Ben.No, don't look at the machine!

273
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
Thank God you're home!I'm watching "Cujo."

274
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
- Alone?- Yes! What is wrong with this dog?

275
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
Did you get to the part where Cujothrows himself at the car?

276
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
No, seriously,what's wrong with the dog?

277
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
Wait, what happened to your date?

278
00:16:04 --> 00:16:05
Oh, it didn't work out.

279
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
- Want to watch the rest of the movie?- Oh, okay. Yeah.

280
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
I never thought I'd say this...

281
00:16:12 --> 00:16:13
...but I hope this dog dies.

282
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
What are you doing?Sit here. Protect me.

283
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?

284
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
- That's him, that's him! That's Cujo!- I know.

285
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
It's gonna be okay.

286
00:16:35 --> 00:16:39
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?I can't watch.

287
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
How can you watch this?Aren't you scared?

288
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
Terrified.

289
00:16:56 --> 00:17:00
So is everybody here?I got here a little early, myself.

290
00:17:00 --> 00:17:01
Let us begin.

291
00:17:01 --> 00:17:06
Now, the hadrosaurids have beenunearthed in two main locations.

292
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
Here...

293
00:17:09 --> 00:17:10
...and...

294
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12

295
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
Now, as for the hydrosaurs...
