49
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
He's the happiest dog ever.I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.

50
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00

63
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
"Oh", "God", "it hurts!"

64
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Worst porn ever!Worst porn ever!

65
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
"- Oh", "make it stop!"- I am trying!

66
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!

67
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
You're cute, but you're not too smart.

68
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
Did I just throw this?

69
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
- Hi.- Hi.

70
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
I accidentally packed thesewith my stuff.

71
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
- Who is this?- Phoebe's friend's dog.

72
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
I don't know his real name.I call him Mozzarella.

73
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
You are so cute. I wish I could play,but I've gotta go to work.

74
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
I hope I stop talking like thisbefore my meeting. Yes, I do.

75
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Bye-bye, Joey.Seriously, I can't stop it.

76
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
Come here! Hey!

77
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
That's Rachel. She used to live here.

78
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
Might as well be honest with you.We love her.

79
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
But we can't have her.

80
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
I really miss her.

81
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
Hey, you understand, right?You're a guy.

82
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
Well, you used to be.

83
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
So, what do you think?

84
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
I've still got it.

85
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
- Why did you get me this?- What is it?

86
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.

87
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
Oh, the dilating!

88
00:05:25 --> 00:05:29
Is this the video of the birth? It'sPhoebe's. Why were you watching it?

89
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
I thought maybe you got me pornfor Valentine's Day.

90
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
If you thought I was gonnaget you porn for Valentine's Day...

91
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
...you were right.

92
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
It's about a girl who movesto the city in search of stardom...

93
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
...but ends up having sexwith a lot of guys.

94
00:05:50 --> 00:05:51
It got four stars.

95
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.

96
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
- Anyway, you wanna take a look?- Well...

97
00:05:57 --> 00:06:01
- I'm not really in a sexy mood.- Hey, what's going on?

98
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
Remember the first timeyou saw "Jaws..."

99
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
...how long it tookto go back in the water?

100
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
We can't let this tapewreck Valentine's Day.

101
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
- You don't know. You didn't see it.- Childbirth is beautiful.

102
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
Oh, beautiful? Really?

103
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
You think this is beautiful?

104
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
Oh, my God!No wonder my mother hates me!

105
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
- See, honey, there's...- Don't touch me!

106
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
- Hi!- Hey!

107
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
- How was Atlantic City?- Good.

108
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
I brought you back a present.

109
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
You didn't have to...

110
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
Saltwater taffy?!

111
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Thanks.

112
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Interestingly, it isn't madewith seawater.

113
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
It's actually madewith salted fresh water.

114
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
That's not interesting.

115
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
- I think it's interesting.- Me too. I missed you!

116
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
- How was your week?- Good.

117
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
- The baby started kicking.- How exciting!

118
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
It was amazing. The only thing is,I wasn't there the first time.

119
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
- Oh, no.- I was missing out on all this stuff.

120
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
- Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.- Yeah, right.

121
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
- What?- Joey cracks me up.

122
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
"Have your ex-wife move in.That wouldn't be awkward."

123
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
Lmagine, I go away for a few days...

124
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
...and my boyfriend is livingwith a woman he got pregnant.

125
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
So, what'd you tell him?

126
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
You didn't tell MonaRachel moved in?

127
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
She seemed to thinkit was such a crazy idea.

128
00:07:47 --> 00:07:50
Plus, she got me taffy.

129
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
- Really? I've never had any.- Ever?

130
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
My mom was too busy planning hersuicide to provide saltwater treats.

131
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
Thank you.

132
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
Are you gonna tell her?

133
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
I will. I want to butter her up first.

134
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
I'm gonna take her to dinner,do all this romantic stuff.

135
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
When she thinksI'm the best boyfriend ever...

136
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
...I'll tell her my pregnantex-girlfriend is living with me.

137
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
If I haven't said it before,she's a lucky, lucky lady.

138
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
So where are...?What the crap is up with this stuff?

139
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
Is it gum? Is it food?What's the deal?

140
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
Oh, it's nice.May I try a pink one?

141
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
So between her and me being friends,and her history with Ross...

142
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
...it just isn't gonna happen.

143
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
It'd be like you falling in lovewith a cat.

144
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
- Hey.- Hey.

145
00:08:45 --> 00:08:49
How's my favorite dog, huh?How's my favorite dog?

146
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
You're subdued.

147
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
- Did you give him a beer?- No.

148
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
- Will you excuse us? We need to talk.- Sure.

149
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
Oh, me, right.

150
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
- He's miserable. What happened to him?- Nothing.

151
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
- We talked about stuff.- What stuff?

152
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
Rachel stuff.

153
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!This is the happiest dog in the world.

154
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
He spends a day with you, and look!

155
00:09:18 --> 00:09:19
He's breathing.

156
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
- I'll take him to Wendy's.- He's fine.

157
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
Look.

158
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
Here's your ball!

159
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Get your ball!Get your ball!

160
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
God, what have I done to you?

161
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
I broke the dog, Pheebs!I broke the dog!

162
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
I'm going to pick up Mona.What are you doing tonight?

163
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans.

164
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
I've got Chinese food on the way,and your saltwater taffy.

165
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
Interestingly, it isn't madewith seawater...

166
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
We actually watchedthe documentary together.

167
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
Oh, my Chinese food.I'll get my cash.

168
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
Mona?

169
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
What are...?Hi! How are you?

170
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
I'm supposed to pick you up.

171
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
I made you a Valentine's dinner.Surprise!

172
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
- Oh! Hey, Mona!- Hi, Rachel.

173
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
What's she doing here?

174
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
I have no idea.

175
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
I'll be watching TVif anybody needs me.

176
00:10:23 --> 00:10:24
What is she doing?

177
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
Lately she just likeshanging out here.

178
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
- Why?- I think she's lonely.

179
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
But it's Valentine's Day.Can't we ask her to go?

180
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
Well, no, she's way too emotional.

181
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
And by emotional, I mean crazy!

182
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
That's just my Chinese food.

183
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
She has food delivered here?

184
00:10:45 --> 00:10:49
Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.

185
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
I'm gonna get in my sweatsand eat this in bed.

186
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
And you thoughtshe was gonna be in our way!

187
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
Open the champagne,and I will be right back.

188
00:11:03 --> 00:11:07
- I've got a surprise.- You got another ex-wife back there?

189
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
Please start drinking.

190
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
- I'm just gonna grab the phone.- Rachel, wait.

191
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
I hope you don't take thisthe wrong way.

192
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
- What are you doing?- Do you need the phone?

193
00:11:23 --> 00:11:24
No.

194
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
Ross is too nice to say it,but this is his apartment.

195
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
We need boundaries, so why don'tyou go back to your place?

196
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
But, Mona, I live here.

197
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
Happy Valentine's Day!

198
00:11:41 --> 00:11:45
Or, something to remember me by.

199
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
- How long has it been this time?- Ninety seconds.

200
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
Ninety seconds is a long timenot to think about it.

201
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
Except all I did was think about it.

202
00:12:00 --> 00:12:01
I know. It haunts me.

203
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
Till now, the worst thing I'd seen wasmy dad doing shots off the houseboy.

204
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
After this, I would gladlymake that my screen saver.

205
00:12:10 --> 00:12:14
We have to get past this.We'll pretend it never existed.

206
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
I could do that.

207
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
Now all we gotta dois get rid of this chair.

208
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
- Oh, thank God!- I know.

209
00:12:37 --> 00:12:38
Come in!

210
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
Hi. I'm sorry to barge inon your Valentine.

211
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
I had to get away from the yelling.Mona's dumping Ross.

212
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
- Oh, my God.- Poor Ross.

213
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
We watch him do yoga in his underwear,but for this he closes the drapes.

214
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
You know that birthing tapeyou wanted to see?

215
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
It's here.

216
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
We should warn you beforeyou watch it. Don't watch it.

217
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
You saw it? Is it scary?

218
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
It's ironic how footageof someone being born...

219
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
...can make you want to kill yourself.

220
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
Now I'm all freaked out.Will you watch it with me?

221
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
No, but I'll leave a sweater thatsmells like me right next to you.

222
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
Seriously, you're not gonnamake me watch this alone.

223
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
She's right. Of course not.

224
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
Honey, get the tape.

225
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
This reminds me of a very specificpart of the tape.

226
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
Here we go.

227
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
Okay.

228
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
Oh, my.

229
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
"All right", "baby. One more time."

230
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
Why is that baby torturing that woman?

231
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
Why have I seen this thingthree times?

232
00:13:54 --> 00:13:55
It's beautiful.

233
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
- It's horrible!- I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!

234
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
- You guys! You guys, look!- What? Did her ass explode?

235
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
No, the baby's out. Look.

236
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
Look at those little fingers and toes.

237
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
Look how happy the mom is now.

238
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
- Oh, Rach.- Screw you! You don't have to do it!

239
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
- Hey.- Hey!

240
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
- What's up?- Mona just dumped me.

241
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?

242
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
Lately, I haven't exactly beenthe perfect boyfriend.

243
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
I didn't tell herI got Rachel pregnant.

244
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
I gave her a key to my apartmentand then had the locks changed.

245
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
Then I lied to her about Rachelmoving in with me.

246
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
In a way, I judge her for notbreaking up with me sooner.

247
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
That really sucks.Especially on Valentine's Day.

248
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
Wait a minute.What are you doing here?

249
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
Joey without a dateon Valentine's Day?

250
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?

251
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
- Sort of.- Really?

252
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
You don't have to seemso happy about it.

253
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
Maybe I can help.

254
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
Whatever it is,I am sure it has happened to me.

255
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
You know, actually,once I got dumped during sex.

256
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
- So anyway, what is it?- Forget about it. It's no big deal.

257
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
- Come on, what is it?- It's nothing.

258
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
Hey, it's me.Why can't you tell me?

259
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
Okay. Sit down.

260
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
There's this woman that I like a lot.

261
00:15:38 --> 00:15:39
But it can't happen.

262
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
She's not a Tribbiani?

263
00:15:44 --> 00:15:45
No!

264
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
So is she someone from work?

265
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
Yes.

266
00:15:51 --> 00:15:52
Well, does she like you?

267
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
Sometimes I think she could.

268
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
But I can't do anything about it.

269
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
Why not?

270
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
It's complicated.

271
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
She was with this other guy.

272
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
Someone from work too.

273
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
I could never do that to the guy.We're friends.

274
00:16:11 --> 00:16:15
So this guy she used to go out with,is he still in love with her?

275
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
- No, I don't think so.- Okay.

276
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
Is he a good guy?

277
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
Yeah, he's the best.

278
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
- Then talk to him.- I don't know.

279
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
It's worth finding out,if you like her.

280
00:16:27 --> 00:16:28
I do, so much.

281
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
I can't stop thinking about her.I can't...

282
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
You know what?You have to go for it.

283
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
How often does this happen to you?You owe it to yourself.

284
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
Here's your warm milk.

285
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
I'm gonna put the bourbonin it at home.

286
00:16:48 --> 00:16:52
Anyway, seriously,just talk to the guy, okay?

287
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
Let me know how it goes.

288
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
It's Rachel.

289
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
and you need to prepare.

290
00:17:06 --> 00:17:10
the whole thing. Just do it!

291
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
to become a star.

292
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
- Anything?

293
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
how she gets pregnant.

294
00:17:27 --> 00:17:28
