1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
What am I sitting on?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
Top of the world?

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Dock of the bay?

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
I'm out.

5
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
Oh, undies!

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
Whose are they?

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:18
- Whose are they?- Not mine.

8
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
Joey's!Got to be Joey's.

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:25
They're mine.

10
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
See, Joey's.They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.

11
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
Why are they here?

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
I don't know.

13
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
I'm Joey.

14
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
I'm disgusting.

15
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
I take my underwear offin other people's homes.

16
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
Get them out of here.What's wrong with you?

17
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
- Take them!- I got them.

18
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
You can touch them.They're yours.

19
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
Chandler? A word?

20
00:01:01 --> 00:01:06
I'm tired of covering for you two.This has got to stop.

21
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
Tighty-whiteys?What are you, eight?

22
00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
Thank you, Joey, so much.

23
00:01:11 --> 00:01:12
You're not welcome, okay?

24
00:01:12 --> 00:01:15
Look, I hate this.You guys keep embarrassing me.

25
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
Yesterday, Rachel foundyour razor in our bathroom.

26
00:01:18 --> 00:01:23
I said it was mine, and thatI was playing a woman in a play.

27
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
Then one thing ledto another and...

28
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
And around the ankles,that is a tough spot.

29
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33
It was.All right, listen...

30
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
All this lying has beenhard on us too.

31
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
Yeah, I bet all the sexmakes it easier.

32
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
Yeah, actually.

33
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
We'll be more careful.

34
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
We don't want them to knowbecause it's going really well.

35
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
And maybe it's going wellbecause it's a secret.

36
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
It sounds weird,but we're so bad at relationships.

37
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
- We are. Help us!- Help!

38
00:01:55 --> 00:01:59
All right.But you do it with me once.

39
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
Didn't think so.

40
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
The One with Ross' Sandwich

41
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
What are you reading?

42
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
Wuthering Heights.

43
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
I have to finish it by tomorrowfor my literature class.

44
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
You're taking a class?That's so cool.

45
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
I really likedthat Lamaze class I took.

46
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
I thought this time I'd gofor something more intellectual...

47
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
...with a less painful final exam.

48
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
That sounds like fun.

49
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
Oh, you should come with me!

50
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
Then I'll have someone to sit with.

51
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
Do you have time to read it?

52
00:03:12 --> 00:03:13
I read it in school.

53
00:03:13 --> 00:03:17
This is going to be so much fun!I have to finish.

54
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
What's wrong, buddy?

55
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
Someone at work ate my sandwich.

56
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
What did the police say?

57
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.

58
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
I can't believe someone ate it.

59
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
It's just a sandwich.

60
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
Just a sandwich?

61
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
I am 30 years old, okay?

62
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
I'll be divorced twice andI got evicted.

63
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
That sandwich wasthe only good thing in my life!

64
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
Someone ate the only good thinggoing on in my life!

65
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
I have enoughfor one more sandwich.

66
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
I was going to eat it myself, but...

67
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
Mon, that would be incredible.Thank you so much.

68
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
I still can't believesomeone ate it!

69
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
Look, I left a note and everything.

70
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
"Knock-knock.""Who's there?"

71
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
"Ross Geller's lunch."

72
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"

73
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
"Ross Geller's lunch.Please don't take me. Okay?"

74
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
I'm surprisedyou didn't wear it home.

75
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
Want to keep your food?Scare people off.

76
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
I learned that on the street.

77
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
Really?

78
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
What would you say, Pheebs?

79
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
Stuff like:"Keep your mitts off my grub".

80
00:04:26 --> 00:04:31
Do you picture Phoebe on the streetwith the entire cast of "Annie"?

81
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
This'll keep them awayfrom your stuff.

82
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
Phoebe, you are a badass!

83
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
Someday I'll tell youhow I stabbed the cop.

84
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
He stabbed me first!

85
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
The Brontë sisters were remarkable womenfor their time.

86
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
They lived in a patriarchal society.

87
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
Sorry I'm late,but I left late.

88
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
So what is the book about?

89
00:05:01 --> 00:05:02
Didn't you read itin high school?

90
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
I started it, but thenthere was this pep rally.

91
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
And I was on top of the pyramid.

92
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
But anyway...

93
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
...what's the book about?

94
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
It's a tragic love storybetween Cathy and Heathcliff.

95
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
It takes place on thesecreepy moors in England.

96
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
Which I think represent the wildnessof Heathcliff's character.

97
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
I totally get symbolism.

98
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
How would you characterizethe theme of this book?

99
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
Let's see...Rachel Greene?

100
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
I would have to saythat it's a tragic love story.

101
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
That's sort of a given...

102
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
...but, yes.Anyone else?

103
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Symbolism!

104
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
And the wildness of the moors...

105
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
...which I think, is mirrored...

106
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
...in the wildnessof Heathcliff's character.

107
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
Excellent! What Rachelhas shrewdly observed here...

108
00:05:54 --> 00:05:55
You completely stole my answer!

109
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
Honey, that was pretty obvious.

110
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
How would you know?You didn't read it!

111
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
What do you think?You in the blue shirt?

112
00:06:05 --> 00:06:10
I think that yours is a questionwith many possible answers.

113
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Would you care to venture one?

114
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
Would you care to venture one?

115
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
Are you just repeating me?

116
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
Are you just repeating me?

117
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
All right. Let's move on.

118
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
Okay, then.

119
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
Why didn't you sayyou hadn't read the book?

120
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
I didn't want himto think I was stupid.

121
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
That was really embarrassing,what happened to you.

122
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
Your note?

123
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
Amazing!

124
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
Not only did no onetouch my sandwich...

125
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
...but people at work areactually afraid of me.

126
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
A guy called me "Mental".

127
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
"Mental Geller."

128
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
I've always wanteda cool nickname like that.

129
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
The best you got in high schoolwas "Wet Pants Geller".

130
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
It was the water fountain, okay?!

131
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
Anyway...

132
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
...people are writingreports for me...

133
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
...pushing back deadlinesto fit my schedule.

134
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
I tell you,you get tough with people...

135
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
...and you can getanything you want.

136
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
Hey, Tribbiani!Give me that coffee! Now!

137
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
This was really fun.

138
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
I've been wonderingif you'd ask me out.

139
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
So you still wondering?

140
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
No. We just went out.

141
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
You're smart.

142
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
I like that.

143
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
Oh, candles!

144
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
What is that, a blanket?

145
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
A video camera?Oh, my God!

146
00:07:45 --> 00:07:50
I can't believe you thought you'dtape us having sex on the first date!

147
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
Joey, is what she just said...

148
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
Oh, my God!

149
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
You're actually going...

150
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
What is going on here?

151
00:08:08 --> 00:08:12
And with Chandler in the next room.What are you, sick?

152
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
I'm Joey.

153
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
I mean, I'm disgusting.

154
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
I make low-budget adult films.

155
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
You promised to be more careful!

156
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
The good Joey name's beendragged through the mud!

157
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
We're so sorry.

158
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
I'm telling everyone.

159
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
It's the only explanation thatdoesn't make me look like a pig!

160
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
No, there's a better explanation.

161
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
Tell them you had to makean adult film for your...

162
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
...adult film class.

163
00:08:52 --> 00:08:53
I like that.But no!

164
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
How does that explainmy underwear at your place?

165
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
I don't know.

166
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
Get ready to come outof the non-gay closet.

167
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
I promise to come up with something.Just give us time.

168
00:09:06 --> 00:09:07
All right.

169
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
But it better make melook really good.

170
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
And another thing:

171
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
The video camera?

172
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
Nice!

173
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
May I have a word?

174
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
Of course, Donald.

175
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
We've been getting reportsof very angry behavior on your part.

176
00:09:29 --> 00:09:30
Threatening letters...

177
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
...refusal to meet deadlines.

178
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
Apparently people nowcall you Mental.

179
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
We want you to speakto a psychiatrist.

180
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
You don't understand.This is so silly.

181
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
This is all justbecause of a sandwich.

182
00:09:48 --> 00:09:49
A sandwich?

183
00:09:49 --> 00:09:53
You see, my sister makesthese amazing turkey sandwiches.

184
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
Her secret is, she puts an extra sliceof gravy-soaked bread in the middle.

185
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
I call it "The Moistmaker".

186
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
Anyway, I put my sandwichin the fridge...

187
00:10:03 --> 00:10:04
Oh, you know what?

188
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
I believe I ate that.

190
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
You ate my sandwich?

191
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
A simple mistake.It can happen to anyone.

192
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
Oh, really?

193
00:10:16 --> 00:10:22
Did you confuse it with your ownturkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?

194
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
Do you, perhaps, remember...

195
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
...seeing a note on top of it?

196
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
There may have been a jokeor limerick of some kind.

197
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
That said it was...

198
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
...my sandwich!

199
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
Now calm down.

200
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
Look in my office.Some may be in the trash.

201
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
It was quite large.I had to throw most of it away.

202
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
You threw my sandwich away?

203
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
My sandwich?!

204
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
What's this book about?

205
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
You didn't read it, either?

206
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
I was going to, but I accidentallyread something else.

207
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
Vogue.

208
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
So tell me about Jane Eyre.

209
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
No, read it yourself.

210
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
Come on,don't be such a goody-goody.

211
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
Fine.

212
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
All right.So, Jane Eyre?

213
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
First you'd think she's a woman,but she's not.

214
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
She's a cyborg.

215
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22
A cyborg?Isn't that like a robot?

216
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
This book was light yearsahead of its time.

217
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
Sorry I'm late.Let's get started.

218
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
What did you think of "Jane Eyre"?

219
00:11:31 --> 00:11:36
Rachel and I were discussing it,and she had very interesting insights.

220
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
Go ahead, Rachel.

221
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
Thank you, Phoebe.

222
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
What struck me mostwhen reading "Jane Eyre"...

223
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
...was how the book wasso ahead of its time.

224
00:11:46 --> 00:11:50
If you're talking about feminism,I think you're right.

225
00:11:51 --> 00:11:55
Well, feminism, yes.But also the robots.

226
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
Since that video camera thingdidn't work out...

227
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
...I thought that I would give youjust a little preview.

228
00:12:08 --> 00:12:09
You're naked!

229
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
I know!

230
00:12:25 --> 00:12:26
Are you okay?

231
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
I'm fine.

232
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.

233
00:12:30 --> 00:12:30
Why?

234
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
On account of my rage.

235
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
Which, if I may say,right now is out of control.

236
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
He gave me a pill for it.

237
00:12:40 --> 00:12:41
A pill?

238
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
When the psychiatrist told meto take a leave of absence...

239
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
...because I yelled at my boss,I started to get worked up again.

240
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
So he offered me a tranquilizer.

241
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
And I thought it was a good idea.

242
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
So I took it.

243
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
They're making you taketime off work?

244
00:12:57 --> 00:12:58
And you're okay with that?

245
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
I don't know.

246
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
It's going to be weirdnot having a job for a while.

247
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
But I definitely don't careabout my sandwich.

248
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
It's so embarrassing! I can't believeyou let me go on like that!

249
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
It was so funny when you compared"Jane Eyre" to "Robocop".

251
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
That was not funny!

252
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
I snapped, okay?You weren't taking the class seriously.

253
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
Come on!What is the big deal?

254
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
I thought it'd be somethingwe could do together.

255
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
I thought it would be fun.

256
00:13:30 --> 00:13:31
Fun is good.

257
00:13:31 --> 00:13:32
But I also wanted to learn.

258
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
People talk about what they learnedin high school. I never went.

259
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
So you really wanted to learn.

260
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
You know, Pheebs,I just wanted to have fun.

261
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
You know who should go?

262
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
I know! I know! I know!

263
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
Monica, you asked the question.

264
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
Oh, my god, that's Monica!

265
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
You get away from me,you sick, sick, sicko!

266
00:14:15 --> 00:14:16
What's going on?

267
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
Joey has got a secret peephole!

268
00:14:21 --> 00:14:22
He has a naked picture of Monica!

269
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
He takes naked pictures of us, thenhe eats chicken and looks at them!

270
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
Oh! Dude, that's my sister!

271
00:14:30 --> 00:14:31
Give me that!

272
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
Wait! Everybody calm down, okay?

273
00:14:33 --> 00:14:38
Let's give our friend a chanceto explain why he's such a big pervert!

274
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
I am not a pervert, okay?

275
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
It's just...

276
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
I just kind of...

277
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
I think I can explain this.

278
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
Thank you.

279
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
Joey's a sex addict.

280
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
What?! No, I'm not!

281
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
It's okay! It's good!

282
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
It's a disease.

283
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
I am not a sex addict!

284
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
Yes, you are!

285
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
That's the only wayto explain all this stuff!

286
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
No, it isn't. It's not.

287
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
Because you could also explain itwith the truth!

288
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
What is the truth?

289
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
- What's up?- What's going on?

290
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
I slept with Monica.

291
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
Well, let's see what everybodythinks of that.

292
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
You slept with my sister?

293
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
Yes, but it was...

294
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
We just did it once, in London.

295
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
This is not good for my rage.

296
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
Is this true?

297
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
Of course, it's true.

298
00:15:43 --> 00:15:48
How else would you explain all theweird stuff that's been going on?

299
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
Yes, it's true.

300
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
If it happened once, how come wefound your underwear in our apartment?

301
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
That was the underwearI was wearing that night in London.

302
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
Right, Monica?

303
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
I guess I wanted to keep it...

304
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
...as a souvenir.

305
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
My God, Monica!

306
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
Are you sure you're notjust a sex addict?

307
00:16:15 --> 00:16:19
If anyone's a sex addict here,it's Monica.

308
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
She has been trying to get me backin the sack ever since London!

309
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
That's why she gave youa naked picture of herself.

310
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
That makes sense.

311
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
And the video camera?

312
00:16:32 --> 00:16:37
I guess I set up the video camerato try and entice Joey.

313
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.

314
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Unbelievable!

315
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
You really kept Joey's underwear?

316
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
Why? Why would you do that?

317
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
I'm Monica.

318
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
I'm disgusting.

319
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.

320
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
I think we've all learnedwho's disgusting and who's not.

321
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
Now, I'm going to get backto my bucket.

322
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
I'm only eating the skin,so the chicken's up for grabs.

323
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
You were making a good point.

324
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
I mean, till you got cut off.

325
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
What's up with that girl Monica?

326
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
I don't know.I didn't come with her.

327
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
Hey, everybody!Everybody, guess what!

328
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
I just convinced Carlto give us a test.

329
00:17:30 --> 00:17:31
Test?

330
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
Come on!Tests make us all better learners!

331
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
Oh, yeah!We should have essay questions!
