1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
This kitty is Mittens.This one is Fitzhugh.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
And this little guyin the cat condo is Jinkies.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
That's a lot of cats, Jo Lynn.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
Single, are you?

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
Chandler Bing.

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
phone? Where's your crazy assistant?

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
What's up, Joe?

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
What have we always wantedto do together?

9
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
Braid each other's hairand ride horseback on the beach?

10
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
No. No. No. When you get hometomorrow night...

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
...you and I are gonna beat the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside!

12
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
- Yeah!

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
Maybe Michael Jordan will dive forthe ball and break my jaw with his knee!

14
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.

15
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
- Hello?- Joey just called.

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
He's got courtside Knicks ticketsfor him and me tomorrow night.

17
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
But tomorrow night's the only nightI get off from the restaurant.

18
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
If you go, we won't havea night together for a week.

19
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
But honey, it's courtside!The cheerleaders will be right in...

20
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
That's not the way to convince you.

21
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
I don't wanna be oneof those wives that says:

22
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
"You can't go to the game.You have to spend time with me."

23
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
So if you could just realizeit on your own...

24
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
I know. You're right.I wanna see you too.

25
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.He's looking forward to it.

26
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
your wife in a long time.

27
00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
Tell him that having a long-distancerelationship is really difficult.

28
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
Tell him that what little timewe have together is precious.

29
00:01:20 --> 00:01:21
I'll think of something.

Okay, stop looking at me like that.

40
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
- Last time that happened, that happened.- Right, right.

41
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
So are you excited aboutyour first night away from Emma?

42
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31

43
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
- Thank you for watching the baby.- It's fine.

44
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
Actually, I invited Mike over.

45
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
- Phoebe's Mike?- Yeah.

46
00:02:37 --> 00:02:38

47

48
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
Maybe have a little dinner,drinks, conversation.

49
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
That's so cute.Ross and Mike's first date.

50
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Will that be awkward?What are you gonna talk about?

51
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
I don't know. But you know, we havea lot in common, you know?

52
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
He plays piano.I played keyboards in college.

53
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
He's been divorced.I have some experience in that area.

54
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
- Yeah?- Hi!

55
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
Girl's night out indeed.

56
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
So I think Emma is probablydown for the night...

57
00:03:09 --> 00:03:10
...but if you need anything...- We'll be fine.

58
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
- You go have fun.- Okay, you too.

59
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
- Thanks.- And I hope you score.

60
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
- Okay. Bye.- Bye.

61
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
So, welcome.

62
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
- I got beer.- I got bottled breast milk.

63
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
- Why don't we start with the beer.- Okay.

64
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
- So Phoebe tells me you play piano.- Yeah.

65
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
You know, I used to play keyboardsin college.

66
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
Do you have one here?

67
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
No.

68
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
Okay.

69
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
You know, I'm divorced.

70
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
Phoebe... Phoebe says you're...You've been divorced?

71
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't really liketo talk about it.

73
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
That's okay. We'll talk aboutsomething else.

74
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
- So you're a paleontologist, right?- Yeah.

75
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
My cousin's a paleontologist.

76
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
Well, he and I would probably havea lot to talk about.

77
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
- Welcome home.- Well, look at you.

78
00:04:34 --> 00:04:35
Yeah. What do you think?

79
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
Well, it looks great. It's just...

80
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
I'm wearing the same thingunderneath, so...

81
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
You see what I mean?

82
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
Hey! How come your door's locked?

83
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
- Just a second!- No, no, no!

84
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
- Joey can't know I'm here.- Why not?

85
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
I didn't want to sayI couldn't go to the game...

86
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
...so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.- So you lied to him?

87
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
It's always better to lie than to havethe complicated discussion.

88
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
Except with you.

89
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
Hey, open the door! What's going on?

90
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
- What are you...?- Hi.

91
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
Why are you dressed like that?

92
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Because Chandler's gonna be homein a couple of days...

93
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
...so I thought I would just, you know,practice the art of seduction.

94
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
I thought I heard a man's voice before.

95
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
No, I was just doing Chandler's sideof the conversation.

96
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
You know, like, "Hi, how do I look?"

97
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
"Really sexy. Could I be any moreturned on?" You know?

98
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
Okay. Wait a minute.

99
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
Why are there two glassesof wine out?

100
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Because one of them is for you!

101
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.

102
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
You know, it's funny. I've beenpracticing the art of seduction myself.

103
00:05:45 --> 00:05:46
- You might wanna keep practicing.- Yeah.

104
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
- It's Joey.- What?

105
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
- Hey, Joe.- Dude, come home!

106
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
- What? Why?- Come home!

107
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
Look, I can't. What's going on?

108
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
I don't know how to tell you this,but I think Monica's cheating on you!

109
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
I told you, you shouldn't have marriedsomeone hotter than you!

110
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
If you can't deal with this,then I'm gonna.

111
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
- No!- I just heard him!

112
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
Can you hear him now?

113
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
No. All right, I'm going in.

114
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
- No, wait!- I heard him again!

115
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
All right, just stay there.I'm coming home.

116
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
I'll see you when you get here.

117
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
I'll wait out in the hallin case he comes out.

118
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
- Is that really necessary?- Absolutely. You'd do it for me.

119
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
Not that you ever have to, becauseI know how to keep my women satisfied.

120
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?

121
00:06:45 --> 00:06:50
I mean, they said 30 minutes or less.Well, how long has it been?

122
00:06:51 --> 00:06:52
Eleven minutes.

123
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
And now 12.

124
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
- So you like the beer?- I do. I do.

125
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
Although, it's actually a lager.

126
00:07:11 --> 00:07:12
What's the differencebetween beer and lager?

127
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
I don't know.

128
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
We could look it up.

129
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
Things are about to get wild.

130
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
Oh, God, remember the girls' nightswe used to have...

131
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
...sitting around talkingabout you and Ross?

132
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
Oh, God! It seems like forever ago.

133
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
I know.

134
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
So, what's going onwith you and Ross?

135
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
Well, I don't know. I mean,for a long time, nothing.

136
00:07:40 --> 00:07:43
But you know, actually,right before you picked me up...

137
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
...Ross and I had a little thing.

138
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
Oh, my God! I love things!What happened?

139
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Well, first he told mehe liked how I looked.

140
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
And then we had a little...

141
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
...eye contact.

142
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
Eye contact?

143
00:07:59 --> 00:08:00
I hope you were using protection.

144
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
Excuse me, these are fromthe two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

145
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
Should we send them something back?Let's send them mashed potatoes!

146
00:08:10 --> 00:08:11
No, wait! Don't do that!

147
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
That'll make them thinkthey can come over.

148
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
So, what if they do?

149
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
We're not here to meet guys. You havea boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.

150
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.We're just having fun.

151
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
You know, not everything has to goas far as eye contact.

152
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
Chandler, you have to tell Joeyyou're not in Tulsa.

153
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
Isn't it better for himto think you're cheating on me...

154
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
...than for him to thinkI'm cheating on him?

155
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
I heard it.

156
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
I don't want him to thinkI'm having an affair.

157
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
All right, I've got a plan.I'll go down the fire escape...

158
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
Because all good plans start with,"I'll go down the fire escape."

159
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
Hear me out, woman!

160
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
I'll go down the fire escape and wait.

161
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
Then it'll be like I just got backfrom Tulsa.

162
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
Joey and I will come inand see that there's no guy in here.

163
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
Aren't you afraid that Joey'sgonna figure all this out?

164
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
I heard it.

165
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
- I'm gonna wait.- The scary pigeon's back?

166
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
It's huge.

167
00:09:35 --> 00:09:39
I can't believe you live in that building.My grandmother lives in that building!

168
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
Ida Greene? No senseof personal space...

169
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
...kind of smells like chicken,looks like a potato.

170
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
- "Spuds" is your grandmother?- That's my "bubbe"!

171
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
So we're on our wayto a couple of parties.

172
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
Maybe we could get your numbersand call if we find something fun?

173
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't reallylooking for anything to happen...

174
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
...with you guys. I have a boyfriend.

175
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
- All right.- It's no big deal.

176
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
So she has a boyfriend.What is your situation?

177
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
Well, it's complicated.I don't actually have a boyfriend, but...

178
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
Then can I have your number?

179
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
I'm sorry, no.

180
00:10:13 --> 00:10:14
Okay.

181
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
Oh, sure!

182
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
Oh, my God, you're givingyour real number!

183
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
Okay, thanks. I'll give youa call later tonight.

184
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
- Great.- Bye.

185
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
Bye.

186
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
So that's great.

187
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
You, Bill, Ross and Emma aregonna be so happy together.

188
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
What were you thinking?

189
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
I don't know. He was cute,and he liked me. It was an impulse.

190
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
But what about Ross?What about your moment?

191
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
- Don't you wanna talk to Ross about it?- No.

192
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
No, because I know exactlyhow the conversation's gonna go.

193
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
"Hey, Ross, you know, I thinkwe had a moment before."

194
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
"Yeah. Me too."

195
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
"Well, but I'm not sure I really wantto do anything about it."

196
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
"Yeah. Me neither."

197
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
"Should we just live together...

198
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
...and not tell each otherhow we're feeling?"

199
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
"Yeah, that works for me."

200
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
Yeah, I see what you mean.

201
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
By the way, nice Ross imitation.

202
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

203
00:11:06 --> 00:11:07
- Well... Hey!- Better.

204
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
The point is maybe I should just stopwaiting around for moments with Ross.

205
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
You know? I should just moveon with my life.

206
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
So really, you're moving on from Ross?

207
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
I don't know.Do I have to decide right now?

208
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
You kind of just did.That guy is gonna call you tonight.

209
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
Ross will pick up the phone,and that's a pretty clear message.

210
00:11:25 --> 00:11:26
Oh, my God, Ross!

211
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

212
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
I have to get my number back.Oh, my God, he's gone!

213
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
"Oh, I have to get my number back!Oh, my God! He's gone! " Dead on.

214
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
- You know, I'm gonna take off.- So soon?

215
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
- Yeah.- Okay.

216
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
Well, thanks... Thanks for the beer.

217
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
- You mean lager?- Yeah. Good times.

218
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
- Hello?- Hey, Mike, it's me.

219
00:12:08 --> 00:12:09
Listen, is... Is Ross near you?

220
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
No, I just left.

221
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
Well, you have to go back in.

222
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
What? Go back? To the landwhere time stands still?

223
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
I'm so sorry, honey, but...

224
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
Okay, Rachel gave this guyher number...

225
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
...and she doesn't want Rossto answer the phone.

226
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
So you have to intercept all his calls.

227
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
I can't do that!

228
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
- He says he can't do that.- Give me the phone.

229
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
Hi, Mike. Hi, listen, I know that thisis a lot to ask, but you know what?

230
00:12:31 --> 00:12:35
If you do this, Phoebe will doanything you want.

231
00:12:35 --> 00:12:39
- Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.- All right. Thank you. Hello?

232
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actually,she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

233
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
All right, I'll do it.

234
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
But really, how much dirtiercan it get?

235
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
Oh, Mike.

236
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
Bye.

237
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
Hey, buddy.

238
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
Hi.

239
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
- Can I come back in?- Why?

240
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
Well, I was just thinking abouthow much more we have to talk about.

241
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
But you left.

242
00:13:17 --> 00:13:18
That didn't take long.

243
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
I thought you said Tulsa was,like, a three-hour flight?

244
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
Well, you're forgettingabout the time difference.

245
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
Yeah.

246
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
Chandler, you're home!

247
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
That's right! Your husband's home!So now the sex can stop!

248
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
What are you saying?

249
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
Joey said you're herewith another man!

250
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
There's no man in here!How dare you accuse me of that!

251
00:13:50 --> 00:13:55
All right. Then maybe you won't mindif me and my friend take a look around.

252
00:13:58 --> 00:13:58
What's he doing?

253
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
I arranged some pillows on the bedto look like a guy.

254
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
Bedroom's clear. Although you mightneed some new pillows.

255
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
All right, well, I'll checkthe guest room.

256
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
Why do I smell men's cologne?

257
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
I think that's you.

258
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazineon myself earlier.

259
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
There's nobody here, Joe.

260
00:14:29 --> 00:14:30
I guess not.

261
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
I can't believe you thought I wascheating. You owe me an apology.

262
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
- You're right. I'm so sorry.- It's an honest mistake.

263
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
It could happen to anybody. See you.

264
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

265
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
If you just got back from Tulsa,how did your suitcase beat you here?

266
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
I climbed down the fire escape,and you can't put that in the closet?

267
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
So, with the exceptionof the fermentation process...

268
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
...beer and ale arebasically the same thing.

269
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
Fascinating, isn't it?

270
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

271
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
I'll get it!

272
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.

273
00:15:14 --> 00:15:15
It's for you.

274
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
I don't understandwhat just happened here.

275
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
What's going on?

276
00:15:25 --> 00:15:26
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
I told you I was in Tulsa because Iwanted to spend the night with Monica...

278
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
...and I didn't know...I didn't think you'd understand.

279
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
You think I'm too dumb to understanda husband needs to be with his wife?

280
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
You think I'm, like...

281
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
- Joey?- Yeah.

282
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
I don't know what to say.We shouldn't have lied to you.

283
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
I feel so bad. Is there anythingI can do to make it up to you?

284
00:15:50 --> 00:15:53
You could go to the game with me.Even though you said you couldn't.

285
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
But then you lied to me and tricked meand gave me a bump on the head.

286
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can'tdo. I promised I'd be with Monica.

287
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
All right.

288
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
- You can go.- What?

289
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
You should go to the game.It's okay. I want you to.

290
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
- Really? You gonna be okay?- Yeah, I'll be fine.

291
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
You know, maybe I'll stay hereand practice the art of seduction.

292
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
- You're gonna put sweats on and clean.- It's gonna be so hot!

293
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
- Bye.- Bye.

294
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
Thanks.

295
00:16:19 --> 00:16:20
Here's your ticket.

296
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
Thanks. Hey, listen...

297
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
...I'm never gonna lieto you again, okay?

298
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
And I want you to knowthat nobody thinks you're stupid.

299
00:16:27 --> 00:16:28
Thanks, man.

300
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
- Where you going?- Game's tomorrow night, Joe.

301
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
Oh, God!

302
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
So glad you're back!

303
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
So, what did you guys do?

304
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
You know, we just drank some beer.

305
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
Mike played with the boundariesof normal social conduct.

306
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
It's true, I did.

307
00:16:53 --> 00:16:54
- Well, goodbye.- Okay.

308
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
- Bye. That was fun, Pheebs.- I know. It was fun.

309

310
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
Lock the door!Lock the door, seriously.

311
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
Shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebefor the drinks.

312
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
Wait, wait. Wait, sorry.Did he call? Did that guy call?

313
00:17:08 --> 00:17:09
No, just his mom.

314
00:17:09 --> 00:17:10
Around 8:30?

315
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
- Yeah.- Then again at 9:00?

316
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
Yeah.

317

319
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
Bill from the bar?

320
00:17:27 --> 00:17:31
Okay, Bill from the bar,I'll make sure she gets your number.

321
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
So... So how was it?

322
00:17:42 --> 00:17:43
Did you guys...?You guys have a good time?

323
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
We had so much fun.It felt so good to be out.

00:17:49 --> 00:17:51

325
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
Yeah?

326

- Hey, you guys.- Hey!

328
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07

329
00:18:19 --> 00:18:20
Stout. That's a kind of beer.
