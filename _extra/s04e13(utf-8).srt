1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
She's the star of the play,and she's my girlfriend.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
I get to have sex with the starof the play!

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
- People can hear you.- I know!

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
She looks great, doesn't she?

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
That is one good-looking man.

6
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
Is it just me, or can you actuallysee his abs through his overcoat?

7
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
So, you been doing this long?

8
00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
No. You're my first.Put the money on the table.

9
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
That's nice.

10
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
Dude!

11
00:00:47 --> 00:00:52
- Is that an expensive blouse?- If you want it to be.

12
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
Here's your girlfriend's button.

13
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
The One with Rachel's Crush

14
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
Do you still have yourold dresses from high school?

15
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
I think I have some. Why?

16
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
Maternity clothes are so expensive.

17
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
Rach, I made a pile of your stuff.If you could just...

18
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
...throw your purses at it.

19
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
Bloomingdale's eliminatedmy department.

20
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
Are you out of a job?

21
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
They stuck me in Personal Shopping,which is a huge step down.

22
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
What is that?

23
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
Where you walk around with rich peopleand tell them what to buy?

24
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
That sounds great!

25
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
We switched apartments. You can't eatour food. That gravy train has ended.

26
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
There's gravy?

27
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
In the big apartment,you deal with people coming over.

28
00:02:21 --> 00:02:26
That fridge has to be stocked.That's your apartment now.

29
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
- What are you doing?- I left a donut up here.

30
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
How was Kathy's play?

31
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sexwith a real good-looking guy.

32
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
It was like somebody wrote downmy worst nightmare...

33
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
...and then charged me $32 to see it.

34
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
That's a good idea for a business.

35
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
I'm screwed.They'll be hot and heavy on stage...

36
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
...then go to their parties,and he'll try to undermine me.

37
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
He'll be like, "Where'syour boyfriend Chester?"

38
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
She'll go, "It's Chandler."He'll go, "Whatever!"

39
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
That is a good trick.

40
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
All right, look.What am I going to do?

41
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
They're actors.They're there to do a job.

42
00:03:11 --> 00:03:12
It doesn't meanthey'll get together.

43
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
So it happened withSusan Sarandon and Tim Robbins.

44
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
That doesn't mean it'll happenwith them.

45
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

46
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

47
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

48
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
They're not a couple.

49
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
I get the game now.

50
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
When they were doing it on stage,was it like really hot?

51
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
So you're fine.

52
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
The rule is when two actorsare actually doing it off stage...

53
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
...then all the sexual tension is gone.

54
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
As long as it's hot on stage,you got nothing to worry about.

55
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
When the heat goes away,you're in trouble.

56
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
You've been to my plays.Have I ever had chemistry on stage?

57
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
You going to seethe play with me tonight?

58
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
I don't know how comfortable I am, goingto see how hot the sex is between them.

59
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
I know...

60
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
No, I'm there.

61
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
- Want some pancakes?- You made pancakes?

62
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
Grab a plate.

63
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Stay right there.

64
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
Getting closer.

65
00:04:23 --> 00:04:24
Don't worry...

66
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
...we also have cereals,muffins, waffles and...

67
00:04:26 --> 00:04:31
...jams, jellies and marmalades,which I'm sure are the same thing.

68
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
We're watching the game here Saturday,if people want to come over.

69
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
I wanted to have people over.

70
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
Yeah? Who's playing?

71
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
The players.

72
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
Somebody seems to be missingbeing the hostess.

73
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
It's a relief, is what it is,is what it is.

74
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Pheebs, your plate.

75
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
I'm quitting.

76
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
I just helped an old woman put ona thong, and she didn't even buy it.

77
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
I'm quitting.

78
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
I'm talking to my boss right now.

79
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

80
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
Call me when you get this message.

81
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Mr. Waltham?I need to talk to you.

82
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
A moment. I'm in the middle of a task.

83
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
And you have a customer.

84
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
I'm Joshua.

85
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
Rachel Greene.What can I do for you?

86
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
I need a new wardrobe. My wife...Well, my ex-wife...

87
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
I'm so sorry.

88
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Anyway, she burned all my clothes.

89
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
I got away with this suitand what turned out to be a skirt.

90
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
Well, at least that's a great suit.

91
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
It was no funat the dry cleaners in the skirt.

92
00:05:47 --> 00:05:52
I need everything down to underwear.If you're willing, I'm all yours.

93
00:05:53 --> 00:05:54
You needed to speak to me?

94
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
No, no, that wasn't me.

95
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
Let's get started.Let me show you my underwear.

96
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
Our selection of underwear.

97
00:06:07 --> 00:06:08
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
- It's this way.- This way? Sorry.

99
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
Right? There wasno chemistry between them.

100
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
Before, they had heat.Now there's none.

101
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
You know what this means.Joey told us.

102
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
Let's not jump to any conclusions.There was some sexual chemistry.

103
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
It was like cousins having sex.

104
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
Here she comes. Don't say a word.Just be cool. Don't be you.

105
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
Hey, you guys!

106
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
Thank you so much for coming again.

107
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
- Did you like it?- Absolutely.

108
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
Wasn't Nick funny whenhe couldn't get his match lit?

109
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
It's a good play, isn't it?

110
00:06:52 --> 00:06:53
I loved the play.You were great.

111
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
And Nick, ditto.

112
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
Clearly, you're having sex with him.

113
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?

114
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
It was obvious.There was no chemistry between you.

115
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
You're accusing me of cheating,and you're insulting my performance?

116
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
I can see how this could happen.You're up there every night, kissing.

117
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.

118
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
I'm playing a part.How can you not trust me?

119
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
You can understand,given how we started.

120
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
I can't believe you'dthrow that in my face.

121
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
I don't even see you denying this.

122
00:07:34 --> 00:07:37
I'll tell you what.Call me when you grow up.

123
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
Don't expect that to happenany time soon!

124
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
I have the best jobin the entire world!

125
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
The most adorable guy came over,and I got to dress him up all day!

126
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
Rachel has a new doll!

127
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
I wish he was. I'd get a Racheldoll and bump them together...

128
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
...and make kissing noises.

129
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
He's got the most beautiful name.I never realized! Joshua.

130
00:08:10 --> 00:08:11
What do I smell?

131
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
I don't know. It smells good.

132
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven.

133
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
Please have some.

134
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
I've been fiddling around,making delicious treats.

135
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
The new "Playboy".

136
00:08:27 --> 00:08:28
Just something I picked up.

137
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
Cookies and porn?You're the best mom ever!

138
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
What?

139
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
Something Joshua said aboutV-necks, but you had to be there.

140
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
How does Jason look in a V-neck?

141
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
- It's Joshua.- Whatever.

142
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
Wait. Wait. This isn't take-out!

143
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
- Hate to eat and run.- Please don't go!

144
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
I've got porn for you too.

145
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
I don't need it.

146
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
People are supposedto hang out here.

147
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
Why? What's the big deal?

148
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
I'm the hostess.

149
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
Not those guys.I'm always the hostess.

150
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
When I was little, the girlsbrought their dollies to my tea party.

151
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
I served the best air.

152
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
Why make a big thing out of everyonehanging out in the big apartment?

153
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
They took our apartment.I wanted to punish them.

154
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
I'm done now. They've suffered enough.

155
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
You should have justmade them hang out here.

156
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
That's true.

157
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
This place will be 10 timesbetter than that place.

158
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
Are we goingto trash their place?

159
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
Steps!

160
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
Slut!

161
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
You'll all be very happy to hearthat Kathy's sleeping with that guy!

162
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
- What?- You were right?

163
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
I confronted her,and she didn't deny it.

164
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
I don't live here!

165
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
Wait, are you sure?

166
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
I may be drunk,but I know what she said.

167
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
Then I went overto Beefsteak Chewley's...

168
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
- Beefsteak Charlie's?- Yes!

169
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
You and Ihave always been...

170
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
- Do you need help?- I got it.

171
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

172
00:10:25 --> 00:10:29
I was with Joshua for an hour today,and he has not asked me out.

173
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
- It's so frustrating.- Ask him out.

174
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Totally. That's such a turn-on.

175
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

176
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
That's the turn-on.

177
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
He just got a divorce.He's probably nervous around women.

178
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
Just make the first move.

179
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
- I've never asked a guy out.- You've never asked a guy out?

180
00:10:46 --> 00:10:47
No, have you?

181
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
Thousands of times!

182
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
That doesn't make mesound too good, does it?

183
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
I don't even knowhow I would go about it.

184
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
What I do is, I look a womanup and down and I say...

185
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
..."Hey. How you doing?"

186
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
Oh, please!

187
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
How you doing?

188
00:11:10 --> 00:11:14
I'm going to do that.I'm going to call and ask him out.

189
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
I can do that. Ask him out.

190
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
"How you doing?"

191
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
It's Rachel Greene, from Bloomingdale's.

192
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
I was just wondering if you...

193
00:11:30 --> 00:11:34
...left your walletat the store today?

194
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
We found a wallet, and we...

195
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
The license? Oh, that is a good idea.

196
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
Well, let's see.This license belongs to...

197
00:11:42 --> 00:11:47
...belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

198
00:11:49 --> 00:11:54
Sorry to bother you at home.I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

199
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
- You've done that 1,000 times?- I've never done that.

200
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
I just got so nervous that he'd say no.

201
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
You got to give him somethinghe can't say no to.

202
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
Invite him to a Knicks game.You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

203
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
- Really?- Absolutely, and if not, can I go?

204
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
What the heck is that?

205
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
Did she call?

206
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
No. Sorry.

207
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
Maybe I should call her.

208
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
Forget her, man. You don't need her.

209
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
He's right.What she did was unforgivable.

210
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
Well, yeah, but you know,what if I was wrong?

211
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
How might you be wrong?

212
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
What if she didn't actuallysleep with the guy?

213
00:12:40 --> 00:12:41
Tell me she told you this.

214
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
She didn't have to.I saw the play. There was no heat.

215
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
- Back me up.- That's your basis?

216
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
That's not backing me up!

217
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
Look, you said,with the offstage and the heat...

218
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
That was just a theory.A lot of theories didn't pan out.

219
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

220
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
Oh, my God!

221
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
"Would you like to goto a basketball game with..."

222
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
"It's funny, basketball,because I happen to have tickets..."

223
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
"Who likes the Knicks?"

224
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
What do you think?

225
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
Well, as a single woman,who is available...

226
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
...I think you look great.

227
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
Oh, yeah, you look great.

228
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
This looks great.

229
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
So you like it?

230
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
I do. I love it.In fact, I think I'll wear it home.

231
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
- Great.- Thank you so much for all your help.

232
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
Well, I guess this is it.

233
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
Thanks.

234
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
I'll see you in the springfor the bathing suits.

235
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
You don't want to do that now?

236
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
That's okay.

237
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
I'll see you around sometime.

238
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
Basketball!

239
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
Sorry?

240
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
I have two ticketsto the Knicks game tonight...

241
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
...just as a thank-you for this week.

242
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
That would be great!

243
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
- Really?- That would be fantastic!

244
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks!

245
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
This is fantastic.Thank you so much, Rachel.

246
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
Good morning.

247
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
I just wanted to come overto say that I'm sorry.

248
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
I acted like the biggest idiotin the world.

249
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
I can completely understandwhy you were so upset.

250
00:14:36 --> 00:14:37
I wish you'd called me.

251
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

252
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
I think this is a good thing.

253
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
We've had our first fight,and now we can move on.

254
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
I know for me, but...

255
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
Nick's pants?

256
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
I think our second fightis going to be a big one!

257
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
- For next time, what do you say?- "I have an extra ticket."

258
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
"An extra ticket."Not "two tickets".

259
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
The first time you asked a guy outhe turned you down?

260
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
He didn't turn me down.He's at the game.

261
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
I got the date.I'm just not on it.

262
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
Okay, it's ready.

263
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
Come on.

264
00:15:27 --> 00:15:28
What's ready?

265
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
Just come.

266
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
Oh, my God!

267
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
This is beautiful!

268
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
Did you work for two days straight?

269
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
Pretty much.

270
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
What do you think of the floor?

271
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
I don't know.Looks the same.

272
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
You used to have carpet.

273
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
I made snacks.

274
00:15:52 --> 00:15:53
Please, just hang out.

275
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
I'm going to rest my eyesfor just a bit.

276
00:15:57 --> 00:15:58
Do you want us to come back later?

277
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
No, no, no. Stay.Just keep talking.

278
00:16:02 --> 00:16:06
I'm always the hostess.

279
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
How'd it go?

280
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
- She wasn't sleeping with him.- Good!

281
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
She is now.

282
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
- What are you saying?- I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

283
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
You know a person, then theyturn around and sleep with Nick.

284
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
Nick and his rock-hard pecsand his giant man-nipples.

285
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
I hate him.And I hate her.

286
00:16:29 --> 00:16:33
I don't hate her. I love her.This is all my fault.

287
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
How? How is it your fault?

288
00:16:35 --> 00:16:36
I should have called.

289
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
If I'd called her, she neverwould have gone out with Nick.

290
00:16:39 --> 00:16:44
They wouldn't have ended up in bed.I threw her at his man-nipples!

291
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
This is not your fault.

292
00:16:47 --> 00:16:51
Your fight does notjustify her sleeping with someone.

293
00:16:52 --> 00:16:55
Well, if she thoughtthey were on a break...

294
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
One of your customers lefthis billfold. A Joshua Burgen.

295
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
- Will you call him?- Yes, I will. Absolutely.

296
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
Hello, Rachel.

297
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
Hi, Joshua.

298
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
- I left my wallet here on purpose.- Really?

299
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
I just wanted to see you again.

300
00:17:28 --> 00:17:29
Oh, I'm glad.

301
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
Rachel, I'd like to saysomething to you.

302
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
