Okay, there you go.

You know, with that goatee,[br]you kind of look like Satan.

48



49

00:01:25.14,00:01:28.21

50

So that's why the priest[br]threw holy water on me.

51



52

00:01:30.46,00:01:31.86

53

You have to cheer up.

54



55

00:01:32.38,00:01:34.49

You should come out with Ross and me.

Anything is better than sitting[br]here crying all day about Kate.

I was crying because[br]nobody believed Quincy's theory.

As a result of improper care,[br]they will be dead.

99



100

00:02:22.98,00:02:24.70

You guys got any of those baby chicks?

I was watching this commercial on Tv,[br]and, man, those things are cute!

How was your trip?

Hotel toiletries from Japan!

These are gonna go[br]in my permanent collection.

126



127

00:02:57.54,00:02:59.37

128

-Want some coffee?[br]-That'd be great.

129



130

00:03:03.38,00:03:04.57

131

Regular or decaf?

132



133

00:03:05.46,00:03:06.94

134

Whichever's closest.

135



136

00:03:08.46,00:03:11.21

137

-Ask me what I did today.[br]-What did you do today?

138



139

00:03:11.42,00:03:14.89

140

I bought a restaurant[br]and I'd like you to be the chef.

141



142

00:03:20.38,00:03:22.49

143

Can you believe he[br]offered me a restaurant?

144



145

00:03:22.74,00:03:25.70

146

What a jerk.[br]You want me to kick his ass?

147



148

00:03:26.38,00:03:29.13

149

It's been my dream since[br]I got my first Easy-Bake Oven. . .

150



151

00:03:29.38,00:03:31.89

152

. . .and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.

153



154

00:03:38.58,00:03:41.73

155

I would kill for this job.[br]I can totally do this job. . .

156



157

00:03:41.98,00:03:45.49

158

. . .and God knows, I've paid my dues.

159



160

00:03:46.90,00:03:49.54

161

But Pete's doing this[br]because he has a crush on me.

162



163

00:03:49.78,00:03:52.29

164

And you're still not[br]attracted to him at all?

165



166

00:03:53.78,00:03:56.29

167

How could I accept a restaurant[br]from him? I can't.

168



169

00:03:56.54,00:03:59.53

170

I couldn't accept a necklace[br]from Stu vincent in the 7th grade.

171



172

00:03:59.74,00:04:03.70

173

But, Mon, that was totally different.[br]He was your health teacher.

174



175

00:04:04.90,00:04:06.30

176

What, honey?

177



178

00:04:06.74,00:04:09.21

179

My side hurts from when[br]you crashed into me.

180



181

00:04:09.46,00:04:10.94

182

Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

183



184

00:04:11.18,00:04:12.37

185

Oh, God!

186



187

00:04:13.26,00:04:14.85

188

Hey, you guys. Guess what?

189



190

00:04:19.46,00:04:21.02

191

Got a job on a riverboat?

192



193

00:04:23.14,00:04:26.05

194

I didn't wear this suit for a year,[br]because you hated it.

195



196

00:04:26.30,00:04:28.33

197

You're not my girlfriend[br]anymore, so: : : :

198



199

00:04:28.58,00:04:30.69

200

I see. This suit is making a point.

201



202

00:04:30.94,00:04:35.01

203

Now that you're on your own, you're[br]free to look as stupid as you'd like.

204



205

00:04:35.74,00:04:36.61

206

You like it, right?

207



208

00:04:36.86,00:04:40.17

209

I like it even more on you[br]than I did on Colonel Sanders.

210



211

00:04:41.02,00:04:42.69

212

Ross, I'm kidding. Come here.

213



214

00:04:42.90,00:04:44.49

215

What were you gonna tell us?

216



217

00:04:44.70,00:04:47.26

218

Was it how you[br]invented the cotton gin?

219



220

00:04:48.82,00:04:51.38

221

So after you put the suggestion[br]in the box. . .

222



223

00:04:51.62,00:04:53.85

224

. . .how long did it take[br]for it to happen?

225



226

00:04:54.10,00:04:55.74

227

About three months.

228



229

00:04:55.98,00:05:00.26

230

So I guess that's about two weeks[br]before the topless thing kicks in.

231



232

00:05:05.58,00:05:08.69

233

I got you something.[br]Open it! Open it!

234



235

00:05:15.90,00:05:17.38

236

It's a chicken.

237



238

00:05:18.74,00:05:19.97

239

It's cute, huh?

240



241

00:05:20.18,00:05:22.41

242

You guys? Do you know[br]anything about chicks?

243



244

00:05:22.66,00:05:24.73

245

Fowl? No.

246



247

00:05:25.06,00:05:27.25

248

Women? No.

249



250

00:05:28.30,00:05:30.49

251

They are a huge responsibility.

252



253

00:05:30.74,00:05:33.41

254

Especially at this age.[br]They require constant care.

255



256

00:05:33.66,00:05:36.69

257

They need just the right food[br]and lots and lots of love.

258



259

00:05:36.94,00:05:39.33

260

Well, no problem there.

261



262

00:05:44.66,00:05:45.65

263

Easy, Lenny.

264



265

00:05:50.46,00:05:53.10

266

So, I mean, have you thought about it?

267



268

00:05:53.38,00:05:54.57

269

Okay, here's the thing.

270



271

00:05:54.82,00:05:57.62

272

Not "the thing. "[br]I hate "the thing. "

273



274

00:05:57.82,00:05:59.01

275

What's "the thing"?

276



277

00:06:00.58,00:06:01.73

278

I can't do it.

279



280

00:06:01.98,00:06:03.73

281

I'm sorry. I wish I could. . .

282



283

00:06:03.98,00:06:06.65

284

. . .but you have these feelings for me.

285



286

00:06:06.90,00:06:08.93

287

That's what you're worried about?

288



289

00:06:09.18,00:06:11.69

290

If that's the problem,[br]we've got no problem.

291



292

00:06:12.90,00:06:16.45

293

I was gonna tell you over dinner,[br]but I met somebody else, on my trip.

294



295

00:06:17.94,00:06:20.77

296

Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.[br]We met on the plane.

297



298

00:06:20.98,00:06:22.38

299

She wanted to finish off[br]my peanuts.

300



301

00:06:22.58,00:06:25.41

302

I thought she said something else.[br]We had a big laugh.

303



304

00:06:28.10,00:06:30.33

305

I got tired of waiting.

306



307

00:06:30.58,00:06:35.49

308

That's great. I'm sorry,[br]but I'm so happy for you.

309



310

00:06:35.86,00:06:37.89

311

-Now I can work for you![br]-I guess you can.

312



313

00:06:38.14,00:06:41.89

314

Oh, my God! This is incredible!

315



316

00:06:42.74,00:06:46.13

317

You know what? I'm gonna roll[br]right into that office and quit!

318



319

00:06:46.38,00:06:47.89

320

All right!

321



322

00:06:48.34,00:06:50.25

323

Could you give me a little push?

324



325

00:06:50.50,00:06:51.29

326

Good luck!

327



328

00:06:51.54,00:06:53.21

329

I'm quitting!

330



331

00:06:57.26,00:06:59.49

332

I'm okay! I'm all right!

333



334

00:07:02.66,00:07:06.21

335

That's exciting.[br]You went to Japan, made up a woman.

336



337

00:07:06.78,00:07:07.97

338

What?

339



340

00:07:08.26,00:07:12.01

341

I'm just saying, this "woman,"[br]I mean, she's fictitious, no?

342



343

00:07:12.86,00:07:14.97

344

-Why would you say that?[br]-You're still into Monica.

345



346

00:07:15.22,00:07:18.05

347

You said there's somebody else[br]so she'd work with you.

348



349

00:07:18.30,00:07:21.41

350

If you spend time together,[br]maybe something might happen.

351



352

00:07:22.78,00:07:24.65

353

You're good. You're good.

354



355

00:07:25.42,00:07:28.38

356

No, I'm fairly intuitive. And psychic.

357



358

00:07:28.78,00:07:30.69

359

It's a substantial gift.

360



361

00:07:32.06,00:07:34.53

362

Can you promise me[br]that you won't tell her?

363



364

00:07:34.78,00:07:38.29

365

Absolutely. I promise.[br]Tell her what?

366



367

00:07:39.18,00:07:40.37

368

Thanks a lot.

369



370

00:07:40.70,00:07:43.29

371

No, I'm serious.[br]I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

372



373

00:07:45.46,00:07:47.49

374

Okay, but this is the last time.

375



376

00:07:48.18,00:07:50.90

377

With a chick-chick here[br]And a chick-chick there

378



379

00:07:51.14,00:07:53.70

380

Here a chick, there a chick[br]Everywhere a chick-chick

381



382

00:07:53.94,00:07:55.29

383

Chicken....

384



385

00:07:58.98,00:08:00.49

386

How's she doing?

387



388

00:08:00.86,00:08:01.85

389

She?

390



391

00:08:02.46,00:08:04.10

392

Don't you think it's a she?

393



394

00:08:04.90,00:08:06.22

395

I don't know.

396



397

00:08:15.90,00:08:18.49

398

I can't tell. Whatever it was[br]went back in too quickly.

399



400

00:08:19.94,00:08:22.90

401

I gotta change. I'm meeting[br]some of the cast for drinks.

402



403

00:08:23.14,00:08:24.25

404

Excuse me?

405



406

00:08:24.50,00:08:25.49

407

What?

408



409

00:08:25.94,00:08:27.97

410

I stayed home while[br]you were at rehearsal. . .

411



412

00:08:28.22,00:08:30.65

413

. . .so somebody could be here[br]with our chick.

414



415

00:08:30.94,00:08:34.73

416

Who was up from 2:00 this[br]morning until 5:00. . .

417



418

00:08:34.98,00:08:36.89

419

. . .trying to get her back to sleep?

420



421

00:08:37.46,00:08:39.37

422

You don't think I get up[br]when you get up?

423



424

00:08:40.42,00:08:41.61

425

Oh, here it comes.

426



427

00:08:41.86,00:08:45.29

428

Yes! Here it comes![br]I'm stuck here all day!

429



430

00:08:45.54,00:08:48.45

431

And then you come in[br]and spend two seconds with us. . .

432



433

00:08:50.18,00:08:53.41

434

. . .and then expect to go off[br]gallivanting with your friends?

435



436

00:08:53.66,00:08:55.53

437

Well, I don't think so, mister!

438



439

00:08:56.54,00:08:59.57

440

I need to relax, okay?[br]I was working all day.

441



442

00:09:00.34,00:09:03.30

443

And you don't think[br]taking care of our chick is work?

444



445

00:09:05.94,00:09:08.33

446

That's not what I said.[br]I just meant--

447



448

00:09:08.58,00:09:11.09

449

I know what you meant!

450



451

00:09:16.98,00:09:19.70

452

Did you notice that ever since[br]we got this chick. . .

453



454

00:09:20.18,00:09:22.90

455

. . .we've been fighting[br]a lot more than we used to?

456



457

00:09:24.90,00:09:27.70

458

I don't know, maybe we weren't[br]ready to have a chick.

459



460

00:09:29.58,00:09:31.49

461

I'll take her back tomorrow.

462



463

00:09:32.10,00:09:33.45

464

We'll get our $3 back?

465



466

00:09:39.02,00:09:42.09

467

I have that Tv thing in two hours,[br]and I need your help.

468



469

00:09:42.30,00:09:46.26

470

What do you think?[br]This blue suit or this brown one?

471



472

00:09:46.58,00:09:48.41

473

The brown one brings out your eyes.

474



475

00:09:48.62,00:09:51.50

476

But your butt looks great[br]in the blue one.

477



478

00:09:52.74,00:09:53.93

479

Really?

480



481

00:10:07.66,00:10:10.30

482

That aspirin dance really works.

483



484

00:10:13.10,00:10:15.41

485

-Is that still. . .?[br]-I'm fine.

486



487

00:10:15.66,00:10:17.45

488

-No, you're not![br]-Yes, I am.

489



490

00:10:17.70,00:10:20.29

491

Look, I'm fine.[br]Watch. Look at that.

492



493

00:10:22.02,00:10:24.74

494

You've got to go to a doctor, okay?

495



496

00:10:24.98,00:10:27.81

497

I have to get ready and go[br]to a dinner at my boss's house.

498



499

00:10:28.06,00:10:30.17

500

There's people there[br]that I have to meet.

501



502

00:10:30.42,00:10:33.33

503

I'm sure you'll make a great[br]impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.

504



505

00:10:33.58,00:10:35.09

506

It's nice to meet you. "

507



508

00:10:36.50,00:10:38.25

509

Come on, you probably[br]have a broken rib.

510



511

00:10:38.50,00:10:41.65

512

I'll go to the hospital tomorrow.[br]It'll still be broken then.

513



514

00:10:41.86,00:10:44.09

515

But you know, I could use a hand[br]getting ready.

516



517

00:10:44.34,00:10:46.41

518

Either help me, or go.

519



520

00:10:46.66,00:10:47.93

521

Fine. I'll go.

522



523

00:10:49.38,00:10:51.61

524

But before you go,[br]could you help me first?

525



526

00:10:55.30,00:10:57.29

527

Sure. I'll help you.

528



529

00:10:58.22,00:11:01.45

530

Good! Do you guys know how[br]to get a chick out of a vCR?

531



532

00:11:10.38,00:11:14.61

533

You know what?[br]I cannot do this with my left hand.

534



535

00:11:14.86,00:11:17.21

536

Would you please help me[br]with this too?

537



538

00:11:25.10,00:11:26.82

539

Let's use this brush.

540



541

00:11:27.66,00:11:29.14

542

-This stuff?[br]-Careful.

543



544

00:11:29.38,00:11:30.25

545

Light.

546



547

00:11:30.50,00:11:34.62

548

Just sweep it across the lid.[br]Just sweep it.

549



550

00:11:35.30,00:11:36.45

551

Sorry!

552



553

00:11:37.14,00:11:38.57

554

That's just poking me in the eye.

555



556

00:11:38.78,00:11:40.01

557

I'm sorry. Close. . . .

558



559

00:11:40.26,00:11:42.13

560

-Just sweep it.[br]-I'm sweeping.

561



562

00:11:42.54,00:11:44.33

563

Sweep, sweep. . . .

564



565

00:11:44.78,00:11:46.77

566

Now make it even,[br]because we don't. . . .

567



568

00:11:47.22,00:11:49.86

569

I don't want it to be too much.[br]I want it to be subtle.

570



571

00:11:50.10,00:11:52.98

572

You don't wear enough of this.

573



574

00:11:57.14,00:12:00.81

575

Since when do you think[br]I don't wear enough of this?

576



577

00:12:01.06,00:12:03.53

578

Close your eye.[br]You're gonna like this better. . . .

579



580

00:12:05.26,00:12:07.17

581

-Close, close.[br]-Blow it.

582



583

00:12:08.38,00:12:11.73

584

Because I think this will make you[br]a little more sophisticated.

585



586

00:12:12.30,00:12:14.21

587

Sophisticated like a hooker?

588



589

00:12:18.22,00:12:19.97

590

-Guess what I'm doing tonight.[br]-What?

591



592

00:12:20.18,00:12:22.01

593

I'm checking out[br]the restaurant with Pete.

594



595

00:12:22.26,00:12:24.53

596

Monica, I am so excited for you!

597



598

00:12:25.86,00:12:27.18

599

I have to tell you something.

600



601

00:12:27.50,00:12:28.29

602

What?

603



604

00:12:28.54,00:12:29.94

605

I can't tell you.

606



607

00:12:31.50,00:12:34.89

608

Wouldn't it be easier to tell[br]me something that you could tell me?

609



610

00:12:35.14,00:12:37.09

611

Well, sure, in a perfect world.

612



613

00:12:38.86,00:12:42.49

614

But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,[br]and I swore to all my Gods.

615



616

00:12:45.58,00:12:47.61

617

Does it have to do with[br]Ross and Rachel?

618



619

00:12:48.62,00:12:49.81

620

Does it have to do with Joey?

621



622

00:12:50.94,00:12:54.33

623

Does it have to do with Chandler[br]and that sock he keeps by his bed?

624



625

00:12:56.54,00:12:58.33

626

No, but let's come back to that later.

627



628

00:13:02.38,00:13:05.73

629

There you go![br]Good enough for your party?

630



631

00:13:11.54,00:13:12.73

632

Sure.

633



634

00:13:13.46,00:13:17.61

635

Sure. I'll just sit next to[br]the transsexual from purchasing.

636



637

00:13:22.06,00:13:25.21

638

All right, I gotta go,[br]So good luck at the party.

639



640

00:13:25.46,00:13:28.21

641

Could you just stay[br]and help me get dressed?

642



643

00:13:30.58,00:13:31.90

644

Sure.

645



646

00:13:32.66,00:13:35.97

647

Great. Okay, just turn around.

648



649

00:13:36.38,00:13:37.29

650

What?

651



652

00:13:37.54,00:13:39.45

653

I don't want you to see me naked.

654



655

00:13:39.70,00:13:43.41

656

I've seen you naked a million times.[br]I ate hot fudge off you naked.

657



658

00:13:43.66,00:13:46.65

659

I sucked that mini-marshmallow[br]out of your bellybutton.

660



661

00:13:47.98,00:13:50.49

662

Yeah, but that was different.[br]We were going out then.

663



664

00:13:50.74,00:13:52.33

665

Now it's weird.

666



667

00:13:52.58,00:13:55.97

668

Rach, you know, I can see[br]you naked anytime I want.

669



670

00:13:56.58,00:13:57.53

671

What?

672



673

00:13:58.34,00:14:02.09

674

All I have to do is close my eyes.[br]See?

675



676

00:14:05.46,00:14:08.05

677

Ross, stop that!

678



679

00:14:08.98,00:14:11.45

680

Come on! Don't think of me[br]like that anymore.

681



682

00:14:11.70,00:14:13.34

683

Sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

684



685

00:14:13.58,00:14:16.01

686

It's one of my rights[br]as the ex-boyfriend.

687



688

00:14:19.06,00:14:22.25

689

Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!

690



691

00:14:22.50,00:14:24.53

692

I'm sorry. It will never happen--

693



694

00:14:24.78,00:14:26.13

695

Wait a minute! Wait, wait. . . .

696



697

00:14:26.38,00:14:29.49

698

Now there are 1 00 of you,[br]and I'm the king!

699



700

00:14:32.58,00:14:34.33

701

Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

702



703

00:14:35.86,00:14:38.37

704

All right. Fine.

705



706

00:14:42.50,00:14:45.46

707

See what you did?[br]I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

708



709

00:14:46.90,00:14:49.37

710

Oh, my God. All right, look, look. . . .

711



712

00:14:50.26,00:14:53.37

713

Easy. Easy.[br]You have to go to the hospital, okay?

714



715

00:14:53.62,00:14:55.34

716

I do. I really do.

717



718

00:14:55.58,00:14:57.97

719

I'll get your coat,[br]then I'll put you in a cab.

720



721

00:14:58.22,00:14:59.89

722

You're not gonna come with me?

723



724

00:15:03.38,00:15:05.49

725

Of course I am.

726



727

00:15:05.70,00:15:07.49

728

I just have to make a call.

729



730

00:15:08.58,00:15:09.81

731

Thank you.

732



733

00:15:15.66,00:15:16.65

734

What's wrong?

735



736

00:15:16.90,00:15:20.29

737

I'm sorry. I just can't go[br]to the hospital looking like this.

738



739

00:15:21.58,00:15:23.57

740

Does it involve travel?

741



742

00:15:23.86,00:15:25.93

743

Does it involve clogs?

744



745

00:15:26.18,00:15:28.53

746

Clogs or claws?

747



748

00:15:28.98,00:15:29.81

749

Clogs.

750



751

00:15:30.58,00:15:32.06

752

Claws?

753



754

00:15:34.74,00:15:38.45

755

So it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel[br]or Chandler or Joey.

756



757

00:15:38.94,00:15:39.97

758

What about Pete?

759



760

00:15:41.10,00:15:42.69

761

What is it?

762



763

00:15:43.46,00:15:46.05

764

-What about Pete?[br]-I don't know!

765



766

00:15:47.50,00:15:48.93

767

I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

768



769

00:15:50.94,00:15:54.33

770

-Phoebe, would you just tell me?[br]-I can't!

771



772

00:15:54.58,00:15:57.33

773

-I gotta go.[br]-But you're so close!

774



775

00:15:57.58,00:15:59.37

776

Something to do[br]with Pete's company?

777



778

00:15:59.62,00:16:01.10

779

Go! You'll never get it!

780



781

00:16:10.38,00:16:11.57

782

I know.

783



784

00:16:13.26,00:16:15.33

785

See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

786



787

00:16:15.54,00:16:18.21

788

She's a completely different[br]kind of chick.

789



790

00:16:22.06,00:16:23.89

791

I love you both.

792



793

00:16:25.06,00:16:27.53

794

But in very different ways.

795



796

00:16:32.42,00:16:35.09

797

What are you doing?[br]You were gonna take her back.

798



799

00:16:35.30,00:16:37.13

800

I did. But the store[br]wouldn't take her back.

801



802

00:16:37.38,00:16:40.49

803

Then I took her to the shelter.[br]You know what I found out?

804



805

00:16:46.26,00:16:49.49

806

If they can't find a home for her,[br]they kill her!

807



808

00:16:49.90,00:16:52.05

809

I won't let that happen[br]to little Jasmine.

810



811

00:16:54.34,00:16:58.54

812

Good, good, because I was[br]kind of having second thoughts too.

813



814

00:16:58.78,00:17:01.97

815

And it's not just chicks.[br]It's all kinds of other animals.

816



817

00:17:02.22,00:17:04.61

818

That's horrible.[br]You did the right thing.

819



820

00:17:04.86,00:17:07.74

821

Thanks. I'm glad[br]you see it that way.

822



823

00:17:18.78,00:17:20.29

824

Funny story!

825



826

00:17:22.90,00:17:24.85

827

I don't believe this!

828



829

00:17:25.10,00:17:28.29

830

Look at this refrigerator![br]It's gigantic!

831



832

00:17:28.54,00:17:32.09

833

I could live in this thing![br]I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!

834



835

00:17:33.78,00:17:37.05

836

Oh, my God! Look at these spider[br]burners! I love spider burners!

837



838

00:17:37.30,00:17:38.65

839

So you like it?

840



841

00:17:38.90,00:17:42.49

842

It is so perfect![br]Thank you so much.

843



844

00:17:42.70,00:17:44.13

845

You're welcome.

846



847

00:17:50.54,00:17:51.94

848

Did you just smell my hair?

849



850

00:17:53.10,00:17:55.29

851

No! No way! What?

852



853

00:17:56.10,00:17:57.82

854

-Oh, God.[br]-What?

855



856

00:17:59.50,00:18:01.25

857

You still have feelings for me.

858



859

00:18:01.50,00:18:05.17

860

I'm just excited about the restaurant,[br]that's all.

861



862

00:18:06.10,00:18:07.50

863

I love you. Is that so bad?

864



865

00:18:09.50,00:18:11.69

866

No, it's not bad.[br]It's not bad at all.

867



868

00:18:11.90,00:18:13.69

869

It's really nice.

870



871

00:18:14.14,00:18:17.73

872

The only one who stands to get hurt[br]is me, and I'm okay with that.

873



874

00:18:18.82,00:18:20.33

875

You may be okay with getting hurt. . .

876



877

00:18:20.58,00:18:23.69

878

. . .but I am not okay with being[br]the one who hurts you.

879



880

00:18:25.46,00:18:27.13

881

That's why I can't take this job.

882



883

00:18:27.38,00:18:28.49

884

What?

885



886

00:18:29.78,00:18:32.42

887

We probably shouldn't[br]see each other anymore.

888



889

00:18:33.38,00:18:34.70

890

I'm sorry.

891



892

00:18:37.22,00:18:41.05

893

I mean, if that's[br]really what you want, okay.

894



895

00:18:51.06,00:18:52.01

896

I'm sorry things--

897



898

00:18:52.22,00:18:56.10

899

Shut up for a second[br]and let me just see something.

900



901

00:19:09.78,00:19:11.13

902

You'd tell me the truth?

903



904

00:19:11.38,00:19:14.65

905

Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.

906



907

00:19:16.58,00:19:20.89

908

Now you stay out here[br]and you think about what you did!

909



910

00:19:22.54,00:19:24.97

911

-That's a duck![br]-That's a bad duck!

912



913

00:19:27.78,00:19:30.09

914

How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?

915



916

00:19:31.50,00:19:32.73

917

What thing? What thing?

918



919

00:19:32.98,00:19:35.89

920

Nothing. There was this thing[br]at the museum. Come on.

921



922

00:19:36.14,00:19:37.17

923

Easy.

924



925

00:19:38.82,00:19:43.10

926

Now, when you come back, I hope you[br]remember that that chick is not a toy!

927



928

00:19:47.14,00:19:48.93

929

What "thing"? What is this "thing"?

930



931

00:19:49.18,00:19:53.33

932

I was kind of supposed to be on Tv[br]tonight for the Discovery Channel.

933



934

00:19:53.86,00:19:55.65

935

Oh, my God!

936



937

00:19:55.90,00:19:57.57

938

Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

939



940

00:19:57.82,00:20:00.41

941

I knew that if I told you,[br]you'd make me go. . .

942



943

00:20:00.66,00:20:04.54

944

. . .and I knew you needed someone[br]to be with you tonight. Come on.

945



946

00:20:05.38,00:20:07.61

947

-I cannot believe you.[br]-What?

948



949

00:20:07.86,00:20:10.69

950

That is the sweetest thing.

951



952

00:20:20.58,00:20:22.01

953

You should get some sleep.

954



955

00:20:24.98,00:20:26.54

956

Sorry I spoiled your evening.

957



958

00:20:26.78,00:20:28.89

959

As long as you're okay.

960



961

00:20:29.10,00:20:32.06

962

So I'll see you tomorrow.

963



964

00:20:40.78,00:20:42.01

965

See you.

966



967

00:20:54.18,00:20:55.45

968

What did you do?

969



970

00:21:06.26,00:21:07.25

971

What you doing?

972



973

00:21:07.46,00:21:09.25

974

Having a swim.

975



976

00:21:09.78,00:21:11.69

977

What about the chick?

978



979

00:21:12.06,00:21:13.49

980

Chicks don't swim.

981



982

00:21:13.70,00:21:15.13

983

Are you sure?

984



985

00:21:16.94,00:21:18.50

986

I don't know.

987



988

00:21:19.82,00:21:21.61

989

-Should we try?[br]-Sure.

990



991

00:21:29.18,00:21:31.69

992

See, I told you.[br]They don't swim.

993



994

00:21:32.38,00:21:34.02

995

Well, give him a minute.

996



997

00:21:35.98,00:21:39.69

998

It's okay.[br]It's okay, baby, baby, baby.

999
