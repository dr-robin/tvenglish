1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
Did you know that during pregnancy...

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
...your fingers swell up to twicetheir size and never go back?

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Oh, my God! Let me see that.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
You fall for it every time.

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Hey! I brought youmy old maternity clothes.

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.Oh, those are so cute!

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
Look. See how they expandas the baby grows?

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:31
And after the baby's bornthey're great for shoplifting melons.

9
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
Good, you're all here.Thanksgiving, 4:00.

10
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
Guess who I invited? RememberWill Culvert from high school?

11
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
- No.- He was in Ross' class.

12
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
Marching band, was kind ofoverweight. Really overweight.

13
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
I was his thin friend.

14
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
I don't remember. Are you talkingabout your imaginary boyfriend?

15
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
No, that was Jared.

16
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
Wow. Haven't thought about himin a long time.

17
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
Will's here on businessso I invited him here.

18
00:01:04 --> 00:01:07
- That's nice.- Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.

19
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
He looks good.Okay, I mean really gorgeous.

20
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
- I still love Chandler.- Wouldn't hurt you to say it.

21
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
Just so you know,I'm not gonna make a turkey.

22
00:01:22 --> 00:01:24
- What?- Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.

23
00:01:24 --> 00:01:27
- Phoebe!- Turkeys are intelligent animals.

24
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
No, they're not! They're uglyand stupid and delicious!

25
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
It's not just Phoebe. Chandler doesn'teat Thanksgiving food...

26
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
...and Rachel hasher poultry aversion.

27
00:01:38 --> 00:01:41
I had to leave when you hadthat chicken.

28
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
I thought that was becauseI put it on my hand and made it walk.

29
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
It's not worth it to makea whole turkey. It's a lot of work.

30
00:01:50 --> 00:01:51
But you gotta have turkey!

31
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
Thanksgiving with no turkey is likeFourth of July with no pie.

32
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
Or Friday with no two pizzas.

33
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
Fine. But there's gonnabe a ton left over.

34
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
No, I will finish that turkey.

35
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
You can eat almost an entire turkeyin one sitting?

36
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!This is what we do.

37
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
We may not be greatthinkers or world leaders...

38
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
...we don't read a lot or run fast,but damn it, we can eat!

39
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22

00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
Isn't it weird how next yearthere will be a baby at the table?

44
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
Rachel's. But good to knowwhere you're at.

45
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03

- Can I help?- Yes.

48
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
Chandler usually helpsbut he's into the game.

49
00:03:09 --> 00:03:13
Could you fold these napkins?I'm gonna go check on the yams.

50
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
No, sweetie. No, not like that.

51
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
We're not at a barn dance.

52
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
Fold them like swans.I showed you at Christmas.

53
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
Yeah, it all just camescreaming back to me.

54
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
- So how's the game?- I have no idea.

55
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
- What?- I'm pretending to watch...

56
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
...so I don't have to help out.

57
00:03:35 --> 00:03:40
I don't believe you!That is brilliant!

58
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
- And Monica has no idea?- No. I just yell stuff at the TV.

59
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
'Ey! What? 'Ey!

60
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
- Your team winning?- Anderson just scored again.

61
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
There is no Anderson.

62
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?

63
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
I can't help you.I didn't realize this game was on.

64
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
- You like football?- Normally, I don't.

65
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
But, you know, Green Bay is playing.

66
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
- You like Green Bay?- It's only my favorite bay.

67
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
- Happy Thanksgiving.- Will, I'm so glad that you came.

68
00:04:24 --> 00:04:25
You must've lost...

69
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
150 pounds. I'll be on one of thoseSubway commercials.

70
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
- A pie!- It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.

71
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
- It's no good. Throw it out.- Meet some people.

72
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
This is my husband, Chandler.This is Will.

73
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
Oh, hey. I'd shake your handbut I'm really into the game.

74
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
Plus, it'd be better for my egoif we didn't stand together.

75
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
- This is Phoebe.- Hi.

76
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
Hey. Wow!

77
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
Well done.

78
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
- Wanna give me a hand?- I can't get over how great you look.

79
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
- You too. You're so fit.- I'm watching but I'm not deaf.

80
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
- I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.- Great, I love Ross.

81
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Good. And Rachel Greene too.

82
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
- Is there a problem?- No. It's okay.

83
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
It's just... God, I hated her.

84
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
- What?- I hated her.

85
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
She was horrible to me in high school.

86
00:05:27 --> 00:05:32
But hey, that was a long time ago.Might be fun to see her again.

87
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
Got any cakes or cookiesor something?

88
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
No, Will! No!

89
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
It's been a while since we screamed.

90
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
- Oh, okay. No!- Come on!

91
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!

92
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
What are you doing?You've got an entire turkey to eat.

93
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
Let me explain to you howthe human body works.

94
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
I have to warm up my stomach first.

95
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
- Eating chips is like stretching.- Okay.

96
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
- Tribbianis never get full.- I'm here to tell you something.

97
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
You can eat and eat, but nothingwill ever fill that void.

98
00:06:10 --> 00:06:15
- Who the hell is this guy?- This is Will, from high school.

99
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
- Will!- Ross!

100
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
Hey, you came! Man, youlook incredible! Hot stuff!

101
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
- Hot stuff?- It's good to see you, man.

102
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?

103
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
- I'm a commodities broker.- That sounds interesting.

104
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
- Yeah, it's not.- Oh.

105
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
- But I'm rich and thin.- Oh.

106
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
I haven't seen you sinceLance Davis' graduation party.

107
00:06:40 --> 00:06:41
That was such a fun night.

108
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
Would've been good if we hadgotten in, but still fun.

109
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
We were lame. Do you rememberhow into dinosaurs we were?

110
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
- Yeah.- So, what do you do now?

111
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
So how long are you in town?

112
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
- Hi.- Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.

113
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
Rachel Greene.

114
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Oh, that's right.Are you gonna be okay?

115
00:07:05 --> 00:07:10
Oh, I'll be fine. It's just...God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!

116
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
High school was a long time ago.

117
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
Look at her standing therewith those yams.

118
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
My two greatest enemies: Rachel Greeneand complex carbohydrates.

119
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
Oh, my God. Who is that?

120
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
- That's Will, from high school.- Oh! I do not remember him.

121
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
Wow, really got that sexysmoldering thing going on.

122
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
Oh, my God. Look at the wayhe's just staring at me.

123
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
He's trying to mouth something to me.

124
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
I hate you!

125
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
- Okay, dinner's ready!- Okay!

126
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
- Solid effort. Solid effort.- Oh, so who won?

127
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
- Green Bay.- Detroit.

128
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
- What?- The Lions technically won.

129
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
But it was a moral victoryfor the Green Bay Mermen.

130
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
Hi! Will, right?Right, hi. I'm Rachel Greene.

131
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
- Oh, I remember you.- Really? Aren't you sweet?

132
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
I gotta tell you, I'm havingthe hardest time placing you.

133
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
Hang on! I think I remember you.

134
00:08:16 --> 00:08:21
Did we fool around atLance Davis' graduation party?

135
00:08:21 --> 00:08:24
- You are unbelievable.- Thank you.

136
00:08:24 --> 00:08:29
Rachel? Why don't you sit here?And Will, you sit way over there.

137
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
That's it? I can eat that, no problem.

138
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
- At least give me a challenge.- This is Chandler's chicken.

139
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
This is the turkey.

140
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Oh. How big is that?

141
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
- About 19 pounds.- It's like me when I was born.

142
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
- Who would like some yams? Will?- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

143
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
What? Oh, can we please keepthe chicken...

144
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
...and the turkey on the other side?

145
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
- The smell is just...- Typical.

146
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
- What?- I said it was typical.

147
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
Typical of you. Queen Rachel doeswhatever she wants in Rachel-land.

148
00:09:18 --> 00:09:19
Seriously, who is this guy?

149
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
Sorry, do you have a problem with me?

150
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
- I don't know. Do I? Do I?- I think you do.

151
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
You were mean to him in high school.

152
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
- You made my life miserable.- I had no idea. I'm sorry.

153
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
Well, you should be.Screw it. Bring on the yams.

154
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
But you worked so hard.

155
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
- Yams!- Okay.

156
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
I'm real sorry for whateverI did to you in high school.

157
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
It wasn't just me. We had a club.

158
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
- You had a club?- The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!

159
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
So you all just joined togetherto hate me?

160
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
- Who else was in this club?- Me and Ross.

161
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
No need to point.She knows who Ross is.

162
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
- You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?- Yes, he was.

163
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
No, no.

164
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
- So who else was in this club?- That exchange student from Thailand.

165
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
But I don't think he knew what it was.

166
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
We went out for two yearsand you never told me?

167
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
You went out with her? We had a pact.

168
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
- It's not like it was binding forever.- It had the word "eternity" in it.

169
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
Monica? Did you know about this?

170
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
I didn't. Is that why you usedto lock the bedroom door?

171
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
- Yeah.- A little relieved, I gotta say.

172
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?I was a stupid kid, okay?

173
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
- The only reason I joined...- Cofounded.

174
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
Cofounded the club, was thatI was in love with you.

175
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
If you think about it,the "I Hate Rachel Club"...

176
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
...was reallythe "I Love Rachel Club."

177
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
But it was reallythe "I Hate Rachel Club."

178
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
So you'd get togetherand say mean things about me?

179
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
- We did a little more than that.- No, no, no.

180
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
What else did you do?

181
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
- We started a rumor.- What rumor?

182
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
Come on, Will.Take off your shirt and tell us.

183
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
- Ross?- It was no big deal.

184
00:11:31 --> 00:11:36
We said that... The rumor was that...

185
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
...you had both male and femalereproductive parts.

186
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
- What?- That's right. We said your parents...

187
00:11:44 --> 00:11:48
...decided to raise you as a girl,but you still had a hint of a penis.

188
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
- Oh, my God!- You started that?

189
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
- You heard that?- Everyone at our school heard it!

190
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
You were the hermaphroditecheerleader?

191
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
Oh, no!

192
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
It makes sense. This is whyAdam Carter wouldn't go out with me.

193
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
Why Billy would just stayin this region.

194
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
Billy's gay now, so that one'snot really our fault.

195
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
- Why didn't you tell me?- I thought it might be true.

196
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
I was afraid that you were gonna cryand then show it to me.

197
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
Stop staring! There's nothing there!It's not true!

198
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

199
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
You are my Everest.

200
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
- You don't have to finish.- I do. Otherwise, what's next?

201
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
Today I can't finish a turkey,but tomorrow I eat half a Power Bar...

202
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
...wrap it up and put itin the fridge? No!

203
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
I gotta change my pants. What wasI thinking? Jeans have no give.

204
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
Listen to what Sean McMahonwrote in my yearbook senior year.

205
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
"Dear Rach, you're such a greatperson. " Not girl, "person. "

206
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
I think you're reading a littletoo much into it.

207
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
"You're a great person.Sorry about your weenie."

208
00:13:16 --> 00:13:20
You want me to call everyoneand tell them it wasn't true?

209
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
- Yes.- Also, tell them I'm skinny now.

210
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
Oh! Me too!

211
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
I won't call anybody.It was a million years ago.

212
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
I don't care. You told peoplethat I was half and half!

213
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
I never did anything to hurt youin high school.

214
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
That's not totally true.

215
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
- What?- What?

216
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
You did start that rumor about Ross...

217
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
...making out with Mrs. Altmann,our 50-year-old librarian.

218
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
How did you know that?

219
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
- It's true?- No.

220
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
I saw you going at itbehind the card catalog.

221
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
Mrs. Altmann? She also made out...

222
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
...with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kekbefore he went back to Thailand.

223
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
In high school you made outwith a 50-year-old woman?

224
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
- Hey, she didn't look 50!- Did she look 16?

225
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
There's a picture of herin the yearbook actually.

226
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
- Wow.- She didn't photograph well!

227
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
She wasn't familiar with the process,having sat for oil paintings.

228
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
How did this happen? Did she lureyou to an early-bird dinner?

229
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
I was working late in the library.It was just the two of us.

230
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
She needed some helpwith her word jumble.

231
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
And one thing led to another.

232
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
If you must know,Anita was very gentle and tender.

233
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
May she rest in peace.

234
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
- Didn't she walk with a cane?- Only when it was damp!

235
00:14:56 --> 00:15:00
I can't believe you told peopleabout this. Everybody knew?

236
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
- You know what? I'm back in the club!- Yeah!

237
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
- I wanna join!- Phoebe?

238
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
I never got to be in a club.I didn't go to high school.

239
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
But three of us would meet behinda dumpster to learn French.

240
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
Fine, you can haveyour stupid, little club.

241
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
But what you did to me is way worsethan what I did to you.

242
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
- You gave me a teeny weenie.- Yeah!

243
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
You're silly.Even with that rumor you were...

244
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
...one of the most popular girls.Everyone wanted to be like you.

245
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
One girl stuffed her pantswith a Tootsie Roll.

246
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
Wow.

247
00:15:38 --> 00:15:42
If it weren't for her rumor,no one would've known who you were.

248
00:15:42 --> 00:15:45
- She put you on the map.- As a romancer of the elderly.

249
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
Mrs. Altmann used to be pretty.

250
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
The eyes did still sparkle.

251
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
This stuff is so way in the past.You've been through so much.

252
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
You got so much moreimportant stuff going on.

253
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
Can't you just let this go?

254
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
- She's right.- We are having a baby together.

255
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
Hold on.

256
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
- You got her pregnant?- Yeah.

257
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
- Are you getting married?- No.

258
00:16:14 --> 00:16:18
So you knocked her up but you'renot gonna marry her. Dude.

259
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
- Anybody?- Okay.

260
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
It's exactly how I imaginedit would be.

261
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
All right, where's that turkey?

262
00:16:37 --> 00:16:41
- Those are my maternity pants!- No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!

263
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
Well, that's it. I'm done.

264
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
Here come the meat sweats.

265
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
Well, Joey, we're allvery proud of you.

266
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
I believe we can expect a callfrom the president any moment now.

267
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
- Anything we can do?- Just nobody press on my stomach.

268
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
You can keep those pants, by the way.

269
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
What you got there?What is that, pie?

270
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
- You want some?- Just cut me a little sliver.

271
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
Little bigger.

272
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
Little bigger.

273
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
What are you afraid of?Cut me a real piece!

274
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
