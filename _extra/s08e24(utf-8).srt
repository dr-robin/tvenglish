"Previously on" Friends:

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
I've been at this for 17 hours.

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
- How many centimeters am I dilated?- Three.

4
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
Just three? I'm dilated three!

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
- We talk about having babies someday.- We're gonna try?

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
- Right here?- No, not here.

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Maybe here.

8
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
Your grandma's engagement ring,I want you to give it to Rachel.

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
- Mom, no.- This isn't some girl...

10
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
...you picked up in a barand humped.

11
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
I take it you're just visiting someone?

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
- Wanna visit someone else?- I would like that.

13
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
- That's him.- Great. Go get him!

14
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
Maybe you could go in first.

15
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.I have a few routine questions.

16
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
Do you sleep with womenand never call them again?

17
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
Oh, my God!

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
Should we tell Rachel there's an emptyroom right next to hers?

19
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

20
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
Well, let me think about that.While I remove my pants!

21
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!

22
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
Does that sound like Janice?

23
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
If it's not, then there's two of them.

24
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
And that would meanit's the end of the world!

25

00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
Hey.

29
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
- Hey.- Hi.

30
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
I can't believe this is taking so long.How are you?

31
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
Not bad. You know that feeling, tryingto blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?

32
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?

33
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
Mother of God, it's true!

34
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
Chandler Bing!

35
00:02:17 --> 00:02:17
Janice.

36
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.Contracting and everything.

37
00:02:22 --> 00:02:25
Oh, this should be easy.I have a very wide pelvis.

38
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
You remember, Chandler.

39
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
I didn't know you were pregnant.

40
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
Who's the unwitting humanwhose essence you've stolen?

41
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
It's you.

42
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
This is yours.

43
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
What?

44
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
Look how nervous he gets!We haven't slept together in years!

45
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
That's funny. Does it hurt?Does the labor hurt?

46
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
Okay, I have one.If you had to, which would you eat?

47
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

48
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

49
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
'Cause at least I could explain to himthat you're making me eat him.

50
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
- Oh. Somebody went to college.- Yeah.

51
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

52
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.

53
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
Oh. I'll get it.

54
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
I usually get to know a girl betterbefore I let her spoon me.

55
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

56
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
Oh, that's five, Ross.Five women have had five babies...

57
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
...and I have had no babies.

58
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
Why doesn't she want to come out?

59
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
I think you made such a nicehome for her...

60
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
...the last nine months,that she just doesn't want to leave.

61
00:03:45 --> 00:03:50
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.

62
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
- Oh, God.- Okay. Okay.

63
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

64
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
Do something! Get me drugs...

65
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
...or you light a fire up in thereand just smoke it out!

66
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
I think you're ready to goto the delivery room.

67
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
What?

68
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
Ten centimeters.You're about to become a mom.

69
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
Oh, my God. Okay.

70
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.

71
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
Oh, my God! That's the doctorwho was in my room before.

72
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.

73
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
I'm telling you, the guyfrom that show was here...

74
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
...asking me all these weird questions.

75
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
Do you really believe that a characterfrom a TV show was here?

76
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
Rachel's having her baby!

77
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
That's him! You know him?

78
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
Okay. Okay. L... Okay.

79
00:04:48 --> 00:04:52
I sent my friend, Joey,in here to find out stuff about you.

80
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
If it, you know, if it helps,you came off great.

81
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
A lot better than I'm coming offright now.

82
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
I don't believe this. You had himpretend he was a fake doctor?

83
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

84
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
- You tried making me think I was crazy?- That was wrong. I'm so sorry.

85
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
It's just that I liked you so much.Can we just start over?

86
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
I don't think so.

87
00:05:15 --> 00:05:19
If I may? You told me a lotof personal stuff about you, right?

88
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
Now, maybe it would help if you knewsome personal stuff about her.

89
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
She was married to a gay ice dancer.

90
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
She gave birth to herbrother's triplets.

91
00:05:31 --> 00:05:35
Her twin sister used to do porn.

92
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
- We're trying to dial down the crazy.- Right.

93
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
We don't know each other,so it'd be easy to forget this...

94
00:05:44 --> 00:05:48
...but there's something between us.I don't know about you...

95
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

96
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
- It doesn't happen to me, either.- Me, neither!

97
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
Push. Push. We're gonna pushfor five more seconds.

98
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
Five, four...

99
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Three, two, one! Oh!

100
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
The next contraction will bein 20 seconds.

101
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
- I can't push anymore!- You're doing great.

102
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

103
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

104
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
- Come on.- Push. Wait.

105
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
- I see something.- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!

106
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
- Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!- What is that?

107
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.

108
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
- I thought she had two heads.- Oh, God!

109
00:06:27 --> 00:06:28
Will she be okay?

110
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
- She'll be fine.- Yeah.

111
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
She's in a difficult position,so push hard.

112
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
- Okay.- Go. Come on. Go! Go!

113
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
You'll have to push harder.

114
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
- I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

115
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
I can't do it.Please, you do it for me!

116
00:06:43 --> 00:06:49
Let's go. One more time.One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

117
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
Good.

118
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
Keep pushing!

119
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
Are you okay?

120
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
You have no idea how much this hurts.

121
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
Keep going! Keep going!

122
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
Here we go!

123
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
She's upside down, but she's coming!

124
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
- Oh, God!- Oh! Oh, my God!

125
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
Oh, my God, she's here.

126
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
Oh, she's perfect.

127
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.

128
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
- Where'd she go?- They're just wrapping her up.

129
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
Okay. Well, be careful with her,she's really tiny.

130
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
Here she is.

131
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

132
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
I know. Oh.

133
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

134
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
- Do we have a name yet?- No, not yet.

135
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
Fine. For now we'll justcall her Baby Girl Greene.

136
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.

137
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
Hello, Baby Girl.

138
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
- Can we come in?- Oh, come on in.

139
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
- Oh, there she is.- Oh, she's so beautiful.

140
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
Here.

141
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

142
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunkand had sex.

143
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
It's incredible. I mean,one minute she's inside you...

144
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
...and then 47 hours later,here she is.

145
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
She looks so real.

146
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
You know what I mean.

147
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
- Okay, my turn. My turn.- Aunt Phoebe.

148
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!

149
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

150
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
I won't.

151
00:09:09 --> 00:09:13
- Honey, what's the matter?- Nothing. I just can't stop crying.

152
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
The doctor said it's normal,plus you're sleep-deprived.

153
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
You guys are all sleep-deprived.

154
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
I don't see you weeping because youput your slippers on the wrong feet.

155
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
Oh, God.

156
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
- What's the matter now?- I was reliving it.

157
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
Do you know what you're gonnacall her yet?

158
00:09:31 --> 00:09:36
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?I thought that was so original.

159
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
Actually, we've narrowed itdown to two.

160
00:09:39 --> 00:09:43
And you know what? I love them both.So just pick one, and that'll be it.

161
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
Wow, okay. Everyone?

162
00:09:48 --> 00:09:52
This is Isabella.

163
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
- Hi, Isabella!- Hi.

164
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
What?

165
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
That's not her name.

166
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feellike an Isabella.

167
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
- What was the other one?- Delilah.

168
00:10:05 --> 00:10:09
Oh, great! At least shesounds like a biblical whore.

169
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
So, I guess we're back to Baby Girl.

170
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
What will we do?

171
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
- You'll find a name.- Easy for you to say.

172
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
You know what yourkids' names will be.

173
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
- You do?- I had them picked out since I was 14.

174
00:10:25 --> 00:10:29
Oh, no, it's gonna be named aftersome snack or baked good, isn't it?

175
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36
- Well, tell us, what are they?- Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

176
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
- And if it's a girl?- I don't want to say.

177
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
Oh, stop. Tell us.We're not gonna want it.

178
00:10:43 --> 00:10:44
Okay. It's Emma.

179
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
Emma.

180
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
See, I don't want it.

181
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
- Take it.- What?

182
00:10:59 --> 00:11:00
She's clearly an Emma.

183
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

184
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
Yeah. But I love you more.

185
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.So I'm screwed.

186
00:11:16 --> 00:11:20
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would liketo say hello to his future bride.

187
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
Oh.

188
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,doesn't he?

189
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
He's a keeper.

190
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
- How are you feeling?- Oh, I'm fine.

191
00:11:37 --> 00:11:42
I really admire what you're doing.Just raising her all alone.

192
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

193
00:11:44 --> 00:11:49
Sure. Now. But what happens when hemeets somebody else and gets married?

194
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
Well, then he gets a divorce.It's Ross.

195
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
I'm telling you. Listen to Janice.

196
00:11:56 --> 00:12:01
They all say they're gonna be there,until they start their real family.

197
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
- That's never gonna happen with Ross.- That's what I thought.

198
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spenda weekend with her father...

199
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
...and little Miss New Boobs.

200
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
Really?

201
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
I hate to be the one to say it...

202
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
...but, honey, you two are on your own.

203
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
Well, that's, you know, that's...

204
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
We've been alone for the last20 minutes and we're doing okay.

205
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
Maybe we won't be alone.

206
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
Because lately things have beenhappening between me and Ross.

207
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
And right before I went into labor,we had this kiss. You know?

208
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
So it might be the beginningof something.

209
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
- Hey, Janice.- Oh, hi.

210
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
Who's this little guy?

211
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
- Aaron, your future son-in-law.- Oh, no, no.

212
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
- I'm gonna leave you three alone.- Okay.

213
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
Man, you see the kid on that nose?

214
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
You know what I was thinking about?

215
00:13:05 --> 00:13:10
That kiss before we left the apartment.That was something, huh?

216
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

217
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
But we, we gotta be careful.

218
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
We... You know, we can't letthat happen again, you know?

219
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
Right.

220
00:13:22 --> 00:13:27
- We don't want to go down that road.- No. That's why I brought it up.

221
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
- They didn't have any sodas?- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

222
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
I was talking to this nurse.Completely forgot.

223
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
And so it begins.

224
00:13:46 --> 00:13:46
She in there?

225
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
Yeah. She's putting her down now.That's her.

226
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
- Look at Emma.- I can't decide who she looks like.

227
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
Oh, what, are you kidding?She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.

228
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
I'm sorry. For the last time,why aren't you two together again?

229
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
No, I know.Because you're not in that place.

230
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
Which would be fine,except you totally are.

231
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
It's complicated, okay?

232
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
You love her, you always have,you have a child together.

233
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
There's no right answer.

234
00:14:21 --> 00:14:25
Look, we've been together.Then apart. Then together, then apart.

235
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
And now we have a baby.

236
00:14:29 --> 00:14:33
It's just, if we got together againand it didn't work out?

237
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
I could never do that to Emma.

238
00:14:37 --> 00:14:42
I mean, she came into this worldthinking everything... Now me.

239
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
What, do they put somethingin the water here?

240
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
It's just, Rachel and I,we're doing really well now.

241
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
I know. If you try to make it more,you might wreck it.

242
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
- Yeah, exactly.- Right.

243
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
Or you might get everythingyou've wanted since you were 15.

244
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
Hey.

245
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
I saw a woman breastfeedingtwins at the same time.

246
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
It is like a freak show up here.

247
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
- What's the matter?- Nothing.

248
00:15:15 --> 00:15:16
What is it? Hey?

249
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
- Really, it's nothing. I'm...- Rach, come on. What?

250
00:15:20 --> 00:15:25
I've just been thinking about howmy baby and I are gonna be all alone.

251
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
What are you talking about?What about Ross?

252
00:15:27 --> 00:15:32
Please. He'll be with his real family.The twins and little Miss New Boobs.

253
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
Okay, how longwas I watching that woman?

254
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
I'm just saying that, you know...

255
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
...someday Ross is gonnameet somebody...

256
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
...and he's gonna have his own life.

257
00:15:43 --> 00:15:44
Right?

258
00:15:45 --> 00:15:46
Yeah, I guess so.

259
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
I just never thought I'd be raisingthis baby all by myself.

260
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
That's pretty dumb, huh?

261
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

262
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

263
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
Okay? I promise Iwon't let that happen.

264
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
Joey. Oh, sweetie,what would I do without you?

265
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
You don't have to worry about that,okay?

266
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
Could you grab me my other boxof tissues?

267
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
- They're under Ross' coat.- Sure.

268
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
Oh, my God!

269
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
Joey?

270
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
Oh, my God.

271
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Okay.

272
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
- That was amazing.- I know.

273
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
Hey, do you realize that we may havejust changed our lives forever?

274
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
We may have started our family.In nine months we could be here...

275
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
...having our own baby.

276
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
And if not, we got to do iton a bucket.

277
00:17:30 --> 00:17:31
