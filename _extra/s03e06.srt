Janice has a question.[br]Who of the six of you. . .

18



19

00:00:06.93,00:00:10.53

20

. . .has slept with[br]who of the six of you?

21



22

00:00:11.65,00:00:13.88

23

Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

24



25

00:00:15.09,00:00:18.21

26

I'm sorry, the answer there[br]would be none of us.

27



28

00:00:18.45,00:00:21.89

29

Over the years, none of you[br]ever got drunk and stupid?

30



31

00:00:22.13,00:00:24.60

32

Well, that's really[br]a different question.

33



34

00:00:25.45,00:00:29.84

35

I can't believe a group of people[br]who spends this much time together. . .

36



37

00:00:30.09,00:00:32.00

38

. . .has never bumped uglies.

39



40

00:00:33.57,00:00:36.45

41

There was that one time[br]Monica and Rachel got together.

42



43

00:00:37.29,00:00:38.28

44

What?

45



46

00:00:38.81,00:00:41.01

47

Excuse me, there was no "time. "

48



49

00:00:41.21,00:00:43.60

50

Okay, but let's say there was.

51



52

00:00:44.01,00:00:45.49

53

How might that go?

54



55

00:00:48.21,00:00:49.72

56

Well then answer me this:

57



58

00:00:49.97,00:00:53.81

59

Have any of you ever almost. . .?

60



61

00:00:56.85,00:01:00.21

-Anybody need more coffee?[br]-Hey, there's a dog out there!

71

-That is so unfortunate.[br]-What?

72



73

00:01:52.65,00:01:55.17

74

Cute Naked Guy's[br]starting to put on weight.

75



76

00:01:56.77,00:01:58.60

77

I'll be back in just a minute.

78



79

00:01:58.85,00:02:03.00

80

I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks[br]on the phone.

81



82

00:02:03.21,00:02:05.60

83

You didn't leave lipstick marks[br]on the phone.

84



85

00:02:05.85,00:02:08.49

86

Then it must have been you. Bye.

87



88

00:02:09.65,00:02:10.56

89

Bye-bye.

90



91

00:02:12.05,00:02:14.69

92

-That's why I moved out.[br]-Hey, while we're on that. . .

93



94

00:02:14.93,00:02:18.37

95

. . .when are you gonna tell my sister[br]you don't live here anymore?

96



97

00:02:18.89,00:02:20.72

98

On some level, she already knows.

99



100

00:02:20.97,00:02:23.33

101

She doesn't know you sneak out[br]every night. . .

102



103

00:02:23.57,00:02:25.21

104

. . .and back every morning. . .

105



106

00:02:25.41,00:02:28.53

107

. . .and that you've been[br]at your grandmother's for a week.

108



109

00:02:28.77,00:02:31.00

110

Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

111



112

00:02:36.21,00:02:38.81

113

I'm never gonna find a roommate.[br]Ever.

114



115

00:02:39.01,00:02:39.92

116

Nobody good?

117



118

00:02:40.17,00:02:42.64

119

There was the guy with the ferrets.

120



121

00:02:42.85,00:02:43.68

122

That's plural.

123



124

00:02:45.25,00:02:48.45

125

The spitter. And the guy[br]who enjoyed my name so much. . .

126



127

00:02:48.69,00:02:51.21

128

. . .he made a noise[br]every time he said it.

129



130

00:02:51.41,00:02:54.01

131

"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.[br]Bing! "

132



133

00:02:54.37,00:02:57.44

134

"Great apartment, Chandler Bing.[br]Bing! "

135



136

00:02:57.69,00:02:59.52

137

-How many more tomorrow?[br]-Two.

138



139

00:02:59.77,00:03:01.92

140

This photographer[br]who seemed really dull. . .

141



142

00:03:02.17,00:03:04.84

143

. . .and this actor guy[br]who I'm not sure about.

144



145

00:03:05.09,00:03:07.45

146

When I answered[br]the phone "Chandler Bing" . . .

147



148

00:03:07.65,00:03:09.96

149

. . .he said, "Whoa! Short message! "

150



151

00:03:12.89,00:03:15.20

152

Foot on the floor[br]or come over no more:

153



154

00:03:16.45,00:03:19.12

155

Your dresser is missing,[br]but this she notices.

156



157

00:03:19.69,00:03:21.44

158

-What?[br]-I have to go.

159



160

00:03:24.09,00:03:26.45

161

Carol should be home by now, so. . . .

162



163

00:03:26.69,00:03:29.21

164

-How's it going with you guys?[br]-Better, actually.

165



166

00:03:29.41,00:03:32.40

167

I finally figured out why we're[br]having so much trouble.

168



169

00:03:32.61,00:03:35.05

170

-Oh, really?[br]-Yeah. You know how I have you guys?

171



172

00:03:35.29,00:03:38.20

173

She doesn't have any close[br]friends that are just hers.

174



175

00:03:38.41,00:03:42.40

176

But last week, she met this woman[br]at the gym, "Susan" something.

177



178

00:03:42.77,00:03:47.13

179

And they really hit it off, and[br]I think it's gonna make a difference.

180



181

00:03:50.01,00:03:51.21

182

So, Eric. . .

183



184

00:03:51.41,00:03:53.45

185

. . .what kind of photography do you do?

186



187

00:03:53.65,00:03:55.08

188

Oh, mostly fashion.

189



190

00:03:55.33,00:03:58.05

191

There may be models here sometimes.[br]I hope that's cool.

192



193

00:04:00.25,00:04:01.65

194

Yes, that is cool.

195



196

00:04:02.29,00:04:04.65

197

Because I have models here,[br]you know. . .

198



199

00:04:05.89,00:04:07.69

200

: : :never:

201



202

00:04:08.69,00:04:12.73

203

During the summer I spend most[br]weekends at my sister's beach house. . .

204



205

00:04:12.93,00:04:14.68

206

. . .which you're welcome to use.

207



208

00:04:14.93,00:04:18.00

209

Although I should tell you,[br]she's a porn star.

210



211

00:04:20.65,00:04:23.40

212

Well, I still have[br]one more person to meet.

213



214

00:04:23.65,00:04:26.40

215

But unless it turns out[br]to be your sister. . .

216



217

00:04:27.01,00:04:29.16

218

. . .I think your chances[br]are pretty good.

219



220

00:04:29.89,00:04:31.01

221

All right.

222



223

00:04:35.21,00:04:37.01

224

Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

225



226

00:04:37.21,00:04:40.89

227

This here is the kitchen,[br]and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

228



229

00:04:41.69,00:04:43.97

230

Don't you wanna ask me[br]any questions?

231



232

00:04:46.29,00:04:47.41

233

Sure.

234



235

00:04:49.29,00:04:50.52

236

What's up?

237



238

00:04:51.65,00:04:53.80

239

Well, I'm an actor.

240



241

00:04:54.29,00:04:55.49

242

I'm fairly neat.

243



244

00:04:56.57,00:04:58.24

245

I got my own Tv.

246



247

00:04:58.45,00:05:02.00

248

Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally[br]okay with the gay thing.

249



250

00:05:04.77,00:05:05.84

251

What gay thing?

252



253

00:05:06.81,00:05:11.65

254

Just, you know, in general.[br]The whole "people-being-gay" thing.

255



256

00:05:12.97,00:05:14.37

257

Totally cool with that.

258



259

00:05:17.97,00:05:20.41

260

Okay, Jerry.[br]Thanks for stopping by.

261



262

00:05:28.29,00:05:29.28

263

Oh, my God!

264



265

00:05:37.69,00:05:38.73

266

Hey, Mon.

267



268

00:05:39.69,00:05:42.81

269

-Wanna hear something that sucks?[br]-Do I ever!

270



271

00:05:44.09,00:05:46.65

272

-Chris says they're closing the bar.[br]-No way!

273



274

00:05:46.89,00:05:49.01

275

They're turning it into[br]a coffee place.

276



277

00:05:49.21,00:05:50.61

278

Just coffee?

279



280

00:05:51.25,00:05:53.81

281

-Where are we gonna hang out?[br]-You got me.

282



283

00:05:54.01,00:05:56.48

284

-Can I get a beer?[br]-Did you pick a roommate?

285



286

00:05:56.69,00:05:58.57

287

-You bet.[br]-Is it the ltalian guy?

288



289

00:05:59.09,00:05:59.89

290

Yeah, right.

291



292

00:06:01.65,00:06:02.45

293

He's so cute.

294



295

00:06:02.69,00:06:05.33

296

That's what I want.[br]A roommate I can walk around with. . .

297



298

00:06:05.57,00:06:07.80

299

. . .and be referred to[br]as "the funny one. "

300



301

00:06:08.37,00:06:10.60

302

Table's free. Rack them up.[br]Back in a minute.

303



304

00:06:10.81,00:06:13.01

305

Get ready for me to whip your butt.

306



307

00:06:13.21,00:06:16.01

308

Okay, but after that,[br]we're shooting some pool.

309



310

00:06:18.69,00:06:21.08

311

Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

312



313

00:06:22.25,00:06:24.45

314

My friend ordered an onion. . .

315



316

00:06:24.69,00:06:26.41

317

. . .not an olive.

318



319

00:06:26.61,00:06:29.41

320

And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke. . .

321



322

00:06:29.61,00:06:31.73

323

. . .which I don't think this is.

324



325

00:06:32.09,00:06:34.08

326

-I am so sorry.[br]-That's all right.

327



328

00:06:35.45,00:06:38.36

329

How hard is it to get a couple[br]drinks right, huh?

330



331

00:06:42.09,00:06:44.00

332

I would like to propose a toast. . .

333



334

00:06:44.69,00:06:47.65

335

. . .to the woman who, in one year[br]from today, will become. . .

336



337

00:06:47.89,00:06:50.88

338

. . .Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S.

339



340

00:06:51.61,00:06:54.41

341

I think it's time[br]to see the ring again.

342



343

00:06:58.29,00:07:03.05

344

Isn't it exciting? I mean,[br]it's like having a boyfriend for life!

345



346

00:07:05.81,00:07:07.93

347

Yeah. I know.

348



349

00:07:08.81,00:07:09.80

350

What?

351



352

00:07:10.05,00:07:11.96

353

Oh, I don't know.

354



355

00:07:12.69,00:07:15.57

356

Well, maybe it's just the idea. . .

357



358

00:07:15.81,00:07:18.25

359

. . .of Barry for the rest of my life.

360



361

00:07:18.45,00:07:19.80

362

I don't know, I think l. . . .

363



364

00:07:20.05,00:07:21.93

365

I feel like having[br]one last fling. . .

366



367

00:07:22.17,00:07:25.00

368

. . .just to sort of get it[br]out of my system.

369



370

00:07:27.17,00:07:29.64

371

-Rachel, stop![br]-You're so bad!

372



373

00:07:29.89,00:07:33.52

374

I'm serious. I really think[br]I need to just have. . .

375



376

00:07:33.77,00:07:35.81

377

. . .some meaningless sex,[br]you know?

378



379

00:07:36.01,00:07:38.65

380

With the next guy I see.

381



382

00:07:44.65,00:07:48.01

383

Excuse me, I seem to have[br]dropped my ball.

384



385

00:07:49.97,00:07:50.96

386

Yeah, so?

387



388

00:07:53.57,00:07:55.80

389

And now I've picked it up again.

390



391

00:07:59.01,00:08:01.65

392

My God![br]I went to high school with her.

393



394

00:08:06.81,00:08:09.20

395

Look! Hi! What do you think?

396



397

00:08:09.45,00:08:10.65

398

Oh, my God!

399



400

00:08:10.89,00:08:13.41

401

You can't even see[br]where the Titanic hit it.

402



403

00:08:14.01,00:08:17.37

404

Yes, his name is Barry.[br]He's a doctor, thank you very much.

405



406

00:08:17.57,00:08:20.04

407

Just like you always wanted.[br]Congratulations.

408



409

00:08:20.29,00:08:23.92

410

Thank you. So how about you?[br]Are you seeing anybody?

411



412

00:08:24.17,00:08:25.49

413

Not right now.

414



415

00:08:25.89,00:08:27.37

416

Oh, well, that's okay.

417



418

00:08:28.73,00:08:29.53

419

I know.

420



421

00:08:34.01,00:08:36.21

422

So I think I'll get back[br]to my friend.

423



424

00:08:36.41,00:08:38.69

425

Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

426



427

00:08:42.29,00:08:45.28

428

Can we have lunch[br]the next time I'm in the city?

429



430

00:08:45.53,00:08:46.60

431

That'd be great.

432



433

00:08:46.81,00:08:48.21

434

-Okay.[br]-Thanks.

435



436

00:08:50.01,00:08:53.48

437

Ten bucks says I never see[br]that woman again in my life.

438



439

00:08:54.25,00:08:56.53

440

No, honey, really. It's fine.

441



442

00:08:56.77,00:08:57.57

443

Just. . .

444



445

00:08:58.17,00:08:59.24

446

. . .go with Susan.

447



448

00:08:59.49,00:09:00.53

449

Really, I think--

450



451

00:09:01.25,00:09:03.69

452

I think girls' night out[br]is a great idea.

453



454

00:09:05.69,00:09:07.25

455

Okay. Okay. Bye.

456



457

00:09:07.77,00:09:11.00

458

-What are they doing?[br]-I don't know. Something girly.

459



460

00:09:14.69,00:09:15.92

461

Hey, you're early.

462



463

00:09:16.17,00:09:18.00

464

What are you doing with the lamp?

465



466

00:09:18.49,00:09:20.32

467

Just taking it to get rewired.

468



469

00:09:22.09,00:09:26.61

470

Don't take it where you took the[br]stereo. They've had that over a week.

471



472

00:09:34.41,00:09:37.13

473

Mr. Heckles, no one is making[br]any noise up here.

474



475

00:09:37.65,00:09:39.93

476

You're disturbing my oboe practice.

477



478

00:09:40.29,00:09:43.28

479

-You don't play the oboe.[br]-I could play the oboe.

480



481

00:09:44.17,00:09:47.00

482

Then I'm gonna have to ask you[br]to keep it down.

483



484

00:09:52.05,00:09:53.04

485

Who are you?

486



487

00:09:53.49,00:09:56.88

488

-I'm Eric, Chandler's new roommate.[br]-I'm Chandler's new roommate.

489



490

00:09:58.85,00:10:01.57

491

-I don't think so.[br]-I could be Chandler's new roommate.

492



493

00:10:02.29,00:10:05.04

494

-But he told me over the phone--[br]-He told me in person.

495



496

00:10:06.45,00:10:07.25

497

That's weird.

498



499

00:10:07.49,00:10:10.56

500

I'm going to go into[br]my new apartment now.

501



502

00:10:29.81,00:10:31.01

503

Hi again.

504



505

00:10:38.77,00:10:40.05

506

Thank you so much.

507



508

00:10:40.29,00:10:43.49

509

Don't thank me.[br]Thank the jerk that never showed up.

510



511

00:10:43.69,00:10:45.84

512

Okay, I gotta get to work.

513



514

00:10:46.89,00:10:49.25

515

-You want some help?[br]-No, thanks. I got it.

516



517

00:10:49.45,00:10:50.33

518

No, I don't!

519



520

00:10:51.85,00:10:53.00

521

You okay?

522



523

00:10:55.17,00:10:57.61

524

I stood up too fast.[br]Got a little head rush.

525



526

00:10:58.49,00:10:59.84

527

It's the heat.

528



529

00:11:03.05,00:11:04.64

530

And the humidity.

531



532

00:11:07.01,00:11:08.24

533

That's. . .

534



535

00:11:08.49,00:11:10.21

536

. . .a tough combination.

537



538

00:11:14.49,00:11:16.64

539

Do you want to come in[br]for some lemonade?

540



541

00:11:17.29,00:11:18.52

542

Like you wouldn't believe.

543



544

00:11:25.69,00:11:27.28

545

This is a great place.

546



547

00:11:28.57,00:11:29.56

548

Thank you.

549



550

00:11:30.49,00:11:32.61

551

Just make yourself comfortable.

552



553

00:11:33.57,00:11:34.69

554

Gotcha.

555



556

00:11:37.29,00:11:40.20

557

So this place is really[br]my grandmother's.

558



559

00:11:43.29,00:11:48.00

560

I got it when she moved to Florida.[br]Otherwise I could never afford it.

561



562

00:11:52.09,00:11:53.81

563

So if the landlord ever asks. . .

564



565

00:11:54.01,00:11:57.61

566

. . .I'm an 87-year-old woman who's[br]afraid of her vCR. You thirsty?

567



568

00:11:57.85,00:11:59.81

569

You bet I am!

570



571

00:12:01.29,00:12:02.09

572

Okay. . .

573



574

00:12:02.33,00:12:03.81

575

. . .here's your penis!

576



577

00:12:09.69,00:12:12.73

578

Oh, my God![br]What the hell are you doing?

579



580

00:12:12.97,00:12:15.61

581

You said, "You wanna come in[br]for some lemonade?"

582



583

00:12:15.81,00:12:17.04

584

So?

585



586

00:12:19.09,00:12:21.00

587

Were you just gonna give me lemonade?

588



589

00:12:22.37,00:12:23.44

590

Cover yourself up!

591



592

00:12:23.89,00:12:25.09

593

Oh, right. Sorry.

594



595

00:12:25.29,00:12:26.80

596

God, I don't believe this!

597



598

00:12:27.01,00:12:30.61

599

Someone asks you in for lemonade[br]and that means they want to have sex?

600



601

00:12:30.81,00:12:33.61

602

Usually, yeah.[br]Well, not just lemonade.

603



604

00:12:33.81,00:12:35.88

605

Iced tea, sometimes juice.

606



607

00:12:37.69,00:12:39.76

608

Look, sorry. I just--

609



610

00:12:40.41,00:12:41.64

611

I thought you liked me.

612



613

00:12:41.89,00:12:43.64

614

I'm such a jerk.

615



616

00:12:45.77,00:12:46.76

617

It's okay.

618



619

00:12:48.09,00:12:50.32

620

I suppose it could happen to anyone.

621



622

00:12:50.57,00:12:52.16

623

Not anyone I know, but. . . .

624



625

00:12:55.09,00:12:57.29

626

By the way, I can still see it.

627



628

00:13:09.89,00:13:10.93

629

Where's your bed?

630



631

00:13:14.01,00:13:16.13

632

It's not in the apartment?

633



634

00:13:21.61,00:13:23.97

635

I can't believe this[br]is happening again.

636



637

00:13:25.09,00:13:28.40

638

-What?[br]-Okay, enough with the third degree!

639



640

00:13:30.21,00:13:32.49

641

I don't live here anymore.

642



643

00:13:33.09,00:13:36.05

644

-What are you talking about?[br]-I'm sorry.

645



646

00:13:36.29,00:13:39.01

647

I don't live here anymore.

648



649

00:13:40.89,00:13:44.80

650

I didn't know how to tell you.[br]But, you know, everybody else knows.

651



652

00:13:47.05,00:13:49.12

653

Everybody knows?

654



655

00:13:49.37,00:13:52.57

656

That was supposed to be a good thing.[br]I forget why.

657



658

00:13:55.89,00:13:58.33

659

Do you know I couldn't sleep[br]for a month. . .

660



661

00:13:58.57,00:14:01.80

662

. . .because I got a dot of ink[br]on one of the sofa cushions?

663



664

00:14:02.37,00:14:04.52

665

You could've just turned[br]the cushion over.

666



667

00:14:04.77,00:14:07.65

668

I would have, but I had[br]a spaghetti stain on the other side.

669



670

00:14:08.09,00:14:08.89

671

What?

672



673

00:14:09.13,00:14:10.93

674

This is what I'm talking about.

675



676

00:14:11.17,00:14:14.40

677

I need to live in a land[br]where people can spill!

678



679

00:14:15.65,00:14:17.21

680

Well, you can spill.

681



682

00:14:17.81,00:14:19.09

683

In the sink.

684



685

00:14:19.97,00:14:23.96

686

Oh, honey. It's not your fault,[br]you know. This is who you are.

687



688

00:14:24.17,00:14:27.00

689

And I love you.[br]And I want us to be friends.

690



691

00:14:27.21,00:14:29.81

692

And if I stay here,[br]I don't see that happening.

693



694

00:14:31.85,00:14:34.16

695

-I love you too.[br]-Good.

696



697

00:14:37.49,00:14:38.37

698

What?

699



700

00:14:40.09,00:14:41.52

701

What? I'm just sad.

702



703

00:14:42.25,00:14:44.81

704

No, you're not.[br]You're wondering which cushion it is.

705



706

00:14:51.05,00:14:53.36

707

So what are you watching?

708



709

00:14:53.77,00:14:54.57

710

Baywatch.

711



712

00:14:56.61,00:14:58.04

713

What's it about?

714



715

00:14:59.69,00:15:01.04

716

Lifeguards.

717



718

00:15:01.81,00:15:04.25

719

Well, it sounds kind of stup--

720



721

00:15:04.81,00:15:05.77

722

Who's she?

723



724

00:15:07.29,00:15:08.36

725

Nicole Eggert.

726



727

00:15:09.01,00:15:10.41

728

We like her.

729



730

00:15:16.25,00:15:17.81

731

Wow! Look at them run!

732



733

00:15:20.09,00:15:21.41

734

They do that a lot.

735



736

00:15:24.41,00:15:25.84

737

Hey, you want a beer?

738



739

00:15:26.09,00:15:28.92

740

-I'll get one.[br]-Don't get up. I got a cooler here.

741



742

00:15:35.09,00:15:37.40

743

Do you have any beers?[br]We're out of beers.

744



745

00:15:37.61,00:15:39.41

746

Help yourself.

747



748

00:15:40.01,00:15:41.29

749

You okay?

750



751

00:15:43.89,00:15:45.17

752

Phoebe moved out.

753



754

00:15:47.69,00:15:48.52

755

Right.

756



757

00:15:49.41,00:15:51.24

758

I don't understand.

759



760

00:15:51.49,00:15:55.80

761

Am I so hard to live with?[br]ls this why I don't have a boyfriend?

762



763

00:15:57.21,00:15:59.93

764

You don't have a boyfriend because. . . .

765



766

00:16:01.29,00:16:04.60

767

I don't know why[br]you don't have a boyfriend.

768



769

00:16:05.37,00:16:07.09

770

You should have a boyfriend.

771



772

00:16:08.17,00:16:09.57

773

I think so.

774



775

00:16:11.77,00:16:12.76

776

Come here.

777



778

00:16:12.97,00:16:13.96

779

Come here.

780



781

00:16:16.49,00:16:19.61

782

Listen, you are one[br]of my favorite people. . .

783



784

00:16:19.81,00:16:23.80

785

. . .and the most beautiful woman[br]I've ever known in real life.

786



787

00:16:40.57,00:16:42.13

788

Where is everybody?

789



790

00:16:42.33,00:16:46.29

791

It's already closed. Chris gave me[br]the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

792



793

00:16:46.53,00:16:49.28

794

I think my marriage. . .

795



796

00:16:49.65,00:16:50.80

797

. . .is kind of over.

798



799

00:16:51.29,00:16:53.01

800

Oh, no! Why?

801



802

00:16:53.21,00:16:55.25

803

Because Carol's a lesbian.

804



805

00:16:59.65,00:17:01.13

806

And I'm not one.

807



808

00:17:04.97,00:17:07.72

809

And apparently it's not[br]a mix-and-match situation.

810



811

00:17:08.41,00:17:09.92

812

Oh, my God!

813



814

00:17:11.25,00:17:12.73

815

I don't believe it!

816



817

00:17:13.77,00:17:15.60

818

Oh, you poor bunny.

819



820

00:17:17.25,00:17:18.45

821

I'm an idiot.

822



823

00:17:19.25,00:17:21.00

824

I mean, I should have seen it.

825



826

00:17:21.21,00:17:26.05

827

I mean, Carol and I would be out,[br]and she'd see some beautiful woman. . .

828



829

00:17:26.29,00:17:29.33

830

. . .and she'd be "Ross! Look at her! "

831



832

00:17:29.57,00:17:30.97

833

And I'd think. . .

834



835

00:17:31.69,00:17:33.76

836

. . . "God, my wife is cool. "

837



838

00:17:40.61,00:17:43.60

839

Hey, do you think that Susan person[br]is her lover?

840



841

00:17:46.45,00:17:48.17

842

Well, now I do!

843



844

00:17:49.97,00:17:51.01

845

I'm sorry.

846



847

00:17:53.49,00:17:55.13

848

Seven years!

849



850

00:17:55.81,00:17:58.80

851

I mean, we've been together[br]seven years:

852



853

00:17:59.45,00:18:02.01

854

She's the only woman[br]who's ever loved me.

855



856

00:18:02.25,00:18:04.72

857

She's the only woman I've ever. . . .

858



859

00:18:11.61,00:18:13.12

860

This is nice.

861



862

00:18:13.37,00:18:14.93

863

I know. It is, isn't it?

864



865

00:18:16.69,00:18:19.57

866

No, I mean it.[br]This feels really good.

867



868

00:18:21.77,00:18:24.00

869

Is it 1 00%%% cotton?

870



871

00:18:28.61,00:18:30.28

872

And I got it on sale too.

873



874

00:18:31.65,00:18:32.45

875

I should go.

876



877

00:18:32.69,00:18:36.73

878

One of the lifeguards was just about[br]to dismantle a nuclear device.

879



880

00:18:37.49,00:18:39.80

881

If you want to get[br]a drink later, we can.

882



883

00:18:40.01,00:18:41.41

884

That sounds great.

885



886

00:18:42.17,00:18:43.97

887

Oh, and listen, it's gonna be--

888



889

00:18:44.37,00:18:45.33

890

I know.

891



892

00:18:46.21,00:18:47.28

893

Thanks.

894



895

00:18:51.49,00:18:55.37

896

Maybe this wouldn't have happened[br]if I'd been more nurturing. . .

897



898

00:18:55.85,00:18:59.16

899

. . .or I'd paid more attention. . .

900



901

00:18:59.49,00:19:01.24

902

. . .or I had a uterus.

903



904

00:19:03.09,00:19:04.81

905

-I can't believe it.[br]-I know.

906



907

00:19:05.05,00:19:08.25

908

You know, you don't deserve this.[br]You don't, Ross.

909



910

00:19:08.49,00:19:10.13

911

-You're so good.[br]-Thanks.

912



913

00:19:10.37,00:19:12.01

914

And you're so sweet.

915



916

00:19:12.21,00:19:14.60

917

-Thanks.[br]-And you're kind.

918



919

00:19:14.81,00:19:16.01

920

Thanks.

921



922

00:19:26.89,00:19:27.85

923

Come here.

924



925

00:19:29.57,00:19:31.08

926

Wait, wait, wait.

927



928

00:19:35.81,00:19:37.01

929

It's okay.

930



931

00:19:43.25,00:19:46.32

932

Wait, wait, wait![br]My foot is stuck in the pocket.

933



934

00:19:47.81,00:19:49.48

935

-What?[br]-I can't get it out.

936



937

00:19:49.73,00:19:52.37

938

That's not something[br]a girl wants to hear.

939



940

00:19:52.69,00:19:54.33

941

Come on, don't start.

942



943

00:19:56.01,00:19:56.81

944

What?

945



946

00:19:57.05,00:19:59.41

947

Stupid balls are in the way.

948



949

00:20:17.29,00:20:18.33

950

Oh, well.

951



952

00:20:19.61,00:20:23.52

953

That probably wouldn't have been[br]the most constructive solution.

954



955

00:20:24.41,00:20:26.21

956

You have chalk on your face.

957



958

00:20:27.57,00:20:31.53

959

You're right. I don't know why[br]I always thought this was real grass.

960



961

00:20:38.41,00:20:39.81

962

Honey, you okay?

963



964

00:20:41.05,00:20:43.01

965

My wife's a lesbian.

966



967

00:20:43.65,00:20:45.21

968

Cool!

969



970

00:20:48.57,00:20:50.72

971

Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

972



973

00:21:00.69,00:21:02.73

974

I can't believe you came back.

975



976

00:21:03.65,00:21:05.48

977

Don't say anything.

978



979

00:21:06.05,00:21:09.04

980

I don't wanna speak.[br]I don't wanna think.

981



982

00:21:09.25,00:21:13.85

983

I just want you to take me and kiss me[br]and make love to me right here. . .

984



985

00:21:14.09,00:21:15.32

986

. . .right now.

987



988

00:21:27.49,00:21:29.16

989

You missed the exit.

990



991

00:21:31.01,00:21:31.81

992

Sorry.

993



994

00:21:32.05,00:21:34.80

995

My God, what were you thinking about?

996



997

00:21:37.09,00:21:38.32

998

Barry.

999
