00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
Hey, Eddie.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
- What are you doing here?- Watching you sleep.

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
Why?

6
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
It makes me feel peaceful.

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
Please.

8
00:00:17 --> 00:00:18
I can't sleep now!

9
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
You want me to sing?

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
That's it. I want youout of the apartment now!

11
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
Hannibal Lecter?

13
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
Better roommate than you.

14
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
I don't think you're being fair!One night you see me and you get scared.

15
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
What about the other nightswhen you don't see me?

16
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
Last night you wentand got some water...

17
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
...and I was nice enoughto hide behind the door.

18
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
I didn't realize that.

19
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
Get out now!

20
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
You really want me out?

21
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
Yes, please.

22
00:00:49 --> 00:00:51
Then I want to hear you sayyou want me out.

23
00:00:51 --> 00:00:52
I want you out.

24
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
I want to hear it from your lips.

25
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
Where'd you hear it before?

26
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
All right. You know what?Consider me gone.

27
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
I'll be out by the timeyou get home from work tomorrow.

28
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
- Thank you.- I heard that.

29
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
The One Where Eddie Won't Go

00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
English Subtitles byGELULA & CO., INC.

31
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
Well, look at you!

32
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
Finally got thattime machine working, huh?

33
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
You like it?

34
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
This guy was selling themon 8th Avenue and I thought...

35
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
..."You know what I don't have?"

36
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
A mirror?

37
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
Fine, make fun.I think it's jaunty.

38
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
For a guy who's recently lost his job,you're in a good mood.

39
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
I'll be all right.I'm not starting from square one.

40
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
I was Dr. Drake Ramorayon "Days of our Lives".

41
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
That's got to have some kind of cachet.

42
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
Cachet? Jaunty?

43
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
Chandler gave meword-of-the-day toilet paper.

44
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
I'm gonna get some coffee.

45
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
So? Did you read the book?

46
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
Oh, my God.It was incredible!

47
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
Didn't it, like,totally speak to you?

48
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
What book is this?

49
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
You have to read this book.It's called "Be Your Own Wind Keeper".

50
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
It's about how women needto become more empowered.

51
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
But there's wind.

52
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
And the wind can make us goddesses.

53
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
Do you know who takes our wind?Men. They just take it.

54
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Men just take our wind?

55
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
All the time. Because theyare the lightning-bearers.

56
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
That sounds kind of cool.It's like "The Hobbit".

57
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
It is nothing like "The Hobbit".

58
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
It's like reading aboutevery relationship I've ever had.

59
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
Except for Richard.

60
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
Richard would never steal your wind.

61
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
Because he's yummy.

62
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
But all the others.

63
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
And the part about howthey're always drinking...

64
00:03:11 --> 00:03:12
...from our pool of inner power.

65
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
But God forbid we should take a sip.

66
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
Anybody want a cruller?

67
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
This is a typicallightning-bearer thing.

68
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
It's like...

69
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
..."Hello. Who wants one ofmy phallic-shaped man-cakes?"

70
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
Don't worry about it, already!Things happen.

71
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
You're not mad at mefor getting fired and everything?

72
00:03:36 --> 00:03:37
Look at me.

73
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
Look at me!

74
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

75
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
Can we get back to me?

76
00:03:47 --> 00:03:50
Look, honey. People get firedleft and right in this business.

77
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
I already got you an auditionfor "Another World".

78
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
All right!

79
00:03:55 --> 00:03:56
"Cab Driver Number 2"?

80
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
You're welcome.

81
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

82
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
How can I go from beinga neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

83
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
Things change. Roll with them.

84
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
But this is a two-line part!

85
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
It's like taking a step backwards.

86
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
I'm not gonna do this.

87
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
I'm gonna tell you the same thingI told Al Minza...

88
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
...and his pyramid of dogs.

89
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
Take any job you can get,and don't make on the floor.

90
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
I'll see you.

92
00:04:29 --> 00:04:30
God!

93
00:04:31 --> 00:04:32
Oh, God!I mean, it's just so...

94
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Isn't it?

95
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
This is like readingabout my own life!

96
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
This book could have been called"Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel"!

97
00:04:40 --> 00:04:41
It wouldn't have solda million copies...

98
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
...but it would've madea nice gift for you.

99
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
Sweetie, we've got to go.

100
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
No! Why do we always have to doeverything according to your timetable?

101
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Actually, it's the movie theaterthat has the timetable.

102
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

103
00:05:01 --> 00:05:06
This isn't about the movie theater.This is about you stealing my wind.

104
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
You go, girl!

105
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
I can't pull that off, can I?

106
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
Excuse me, your wind?

107
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
Yes, my wind.

108
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
How do you expect me to growif you won't let me blow?

109
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
You know I don't...

110
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
...have a problem with that.

111
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
I just really need to bewith myself right now.

112
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
You're right.I don't have to apologize.

114
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
Sorry. Damn it!

115
00:05:55 --> 00:05:56
- What is it?- I don't know.

116
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
It's got all this stuffabout wind and trees...

117
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
...and some sacred pool.

118
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
I don't really get it.But she's pretty upset about it.

119
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
This is why I don't datewomen who read.

120
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
What's that?

121
00:06:09 --> 00:06:10
It's my VIS A bill.

122
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
Envelope one of two.

123
00:06:14 --> 00:06:18
- That can't be good.- Open it, open it.

124
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
Oh, my God!

125
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
Look at this!How did I spend so much money?

126
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
That's just the minimum amount.That's your total.

127
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
Thirty-five hundred dollarsat "Porcelain Safari"?

128
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
My animals.

129
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
The guy said they suited me. He spokewith an accent. I was confused.

130
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
I don't know what to do!

131
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
You can start by driving a cabon "Another World".

132
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
- What?- That audition?

133
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
That's a two-line part!

134
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Joey, you owe $ 1100at "I Love Lucite".

135
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
- So what?- So suck it up, man.

136
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
It's a job. It's money.

137
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
I don't need you getting judgmentaland condescending and pedantic.

138
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
Toilet paper?

139
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
I'm not being any of those things.I'm being realistic.

140
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
You're supposed to be my friend!

141
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
I am your friend.

142
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
Then tell me things like,"You'll be fine."

143
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
And "Something big's gonnacome along. I know it!"

144
00:07:08 --> 00:07:09
But I don't know it.

145
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
What I do know is you owe $ 2300at "Isn't It Chromantic?"

146
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
I'm aware of what I owe.

147
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
Then get some sense.It took you 10 years to get that job.

148
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
- How long till you get another?- I don't want to hear this!

149
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
I'm just saying...

150
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
Well, don't "just say"!

151
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
Maybe I should just go.

152
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
I'll see you later.

153
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
Just think about it.

154
00:07:33 --> 00:07:34
I don't need to think about it!

155
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

156
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
That was huge!

157
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
Big things are gonna happen!You'll see!

158
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
Ross!

159
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
You still there?

160
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
What are you still doing here?

161
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
Just some basic dehydratingof fruits and vegetables.

162
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

163
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
Aren't you forgetting anything?

164
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.

165
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
He's feistier than the last one.

166
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
Maybe because the last onewas made by Pepperidge Farm.

167
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
Eddie, isn't there somethingyou're supposed to be doing now?

168
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
Not unless it's got somethingto do with dehydrating.

169
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
Because right now,I'm a dehydrating maniac!

170
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
I thought we had a deal.I thought by the time I got...

171
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
You know what that is?

172
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
Your last roommate's kidney?

173
00:08:28 --> 00:08:29
That's a tomato.

174
00:08:29 --> 00:08:33
This one definitely goesin the display.

175
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
Hey, Gunther.Let me get a lemonade to go.

176
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
Lemonade?

177
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
You okay, man?

178
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
It's career stuff.

179
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
They killed offmy character on the show.

180
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
That's too bad.How'd they do it?

181
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
I fell down an elevator shaft.

182
00:08:53 --> 00:08:54
That sucks.

183
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
I was buried in an avalanche.

184
00:08:57 --> 00:08:57
What?

185
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
I used to be Briceon "All My Children".

186
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

187
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
There'll be no morewatching me sleep! No more...

188
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
...watching!

189
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
I got some great stuff to dehydrate.Grapes, apricots.

190
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
I thought it'd be cool to seewhat happens with these water balloons.

191
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
Get out.Get out, get out, get out!

192
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
- What?- You! Move out!

193
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
Take your fruit!Your stupid small fruit and get out!

194
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
You want me to move out?

195
00:09:50 --> 00:09:55
I gotta tell you, that's kind ofout of the blue, don't you think?

196
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
This is not out of the blue!

197
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
This is smack-dabin the middle of the blue!

198
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

199
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
You don't have to tell me twice.

200
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
Someone will be by for my stuff.

201
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
If you think I'm leaving youalone with my fish, you're insane!

202
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
You want some help?

203
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
No help required, "chico"!

204
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
All the way to the airport, huh?You know, that's over 30 miles.

205
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
That's gonna cost you about so bucks.

206
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
Excuse me, that's fifty bucks.

207
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
Five-O dollars.

208
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
You know what it is?It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

209
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
When I was on "Days of our Lives"as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

210
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
...they'd send overthe whole script on real paper.

211
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
That's great.

212
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
If you wanted to expand this scene,like have the cab crash...

213
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
...I could attend to the victims...

214
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
...because I have a backgroundin medical acting.

215
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

216
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
Don't thank me for coming in.At least let me finish.

217
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
We could take the expressway...

218
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
...but this time of dayyou're better off taking the budge.

219
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
You were going for bridge there,weren't you?

220
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
I'll have a good day.

221
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
Question number 28.

222
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
"Have you ever alloweda lightning-bearer to take your wind?"

223
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
I would have to say no.

224
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
And I would have to say...

225
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
What?

226
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
Do you not remember the puppet guy?

227
00:11:31 --> 00:11:36
You totally let him wash his feetin the pool of your inner power.

228
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
And his puppet too!

229
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
Well, at leastI didn't let some guy...

230
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
...into the forest of my righteoustruth on the first date!

231
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
- Who?- Paul!

232
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
Moving on, moving on.Next question.

233
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
Okay, number 29.

234
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
"Have you ever betrayedanother goddess...

235
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
...for a lightning-bearer?"Okay, number 30.

236
00:11:57 --> 00:12:01
Whoa, whoa, whoa!Let's go back to 29.

237
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
Not to my recollection.

238
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.

239
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
You know the bottlewas pointing at me.

240
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
Only because you took uphalf the circle!

241
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
Listen to you two.It's so sad.

242
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
Looks like I'll be going tothe goddess meetings alone.

243
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
Not when they find outyou slept with Jason Hurley...

244
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
...an hour afterhe broke up with Monica.

245
00:12:27 --> 00:12:28
One hour?

246
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
You are such a leaf blower!

247
00:12:43 --> 00:12:47
Be careful with that 3-D "Last Supper".Judas is a little loose.

248
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
Oh, my God! What's going on?

249
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
They're taking all my stuff back.I guess you were right.

250
00:12:55 --> 00:12:59
No, I wasn't right.That's what I came here to tell you.

251
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
I was totally hung upon my own stuff the other day.

252
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
No, listen. I need the wholesecurity thing, you know?

253
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
To know where my next paycheck iscoming from. But you don't need that.

254
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
And that's amazing to me.

255
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
I could never do what you do.

256
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
- Thanks.- You hold out for something bigger.

257
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
I can't tell youhow much respect I have...

258
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
...for you not goingto that stupid audition.

259
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
- I went.- Great! How did it go?

260
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
- I didn't get it.- Good for you!

261
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
You're living the dream!

262
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
All right, then!

263
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
Not my parrot.

264
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
I can't watch this.

265
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
Hey, hold on, hold on.

266
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
How much for the...How much to save the bird?

267
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
- Twelve hundred.- Dollars?

268
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
You spent $ 1200 on a plastic bird?

269
00:13:42 --> 00:13:44
It was an impulse buy.Near the register.

270
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
Go ahead with the bird.

271
00:13:46 --> 00:13:50
Do you have anything for around $ 200?

272
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
The dog.

273
00:13:55 --> 00:13:56
I'll take it.

274
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
My gift to you, man.

275
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
Thanks, Ross!

276
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
I really liked that bird, though.

277
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
But the dog!

278
00:14:11 --> 00:14:12
Here are your cakes.

279
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
We didn't order cake.

280
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
No, I know. They're from me.

281
00:14:17 --> 00:14:18
You guys, this is not good.

282
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
We have enough troublewith guys stealing our wind...

283
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
...without taking it from each other.

284
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
You're right.

285
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
I love you goddesses.

286
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
I don't ever wantto suck your wind again.

287
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
- Thank you. So are we good?- We're good.

288
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
We're good?

289
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
Let me take these back.They'll take it out of my paycheck.

290
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

291
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
Are you sure this time?

292
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
I actually saw him leave.

293
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
That guy is holding a human head.

294
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
He's holding a human head!

295
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
Check it out, man!

296
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
I tore it off a mannequinin the alley behind Macy's.

297
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
There's no alley behind Macy's.

298
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
So I got it in the junior missdepartment. Big diff.

299
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
It'll make a hell of a conversationpiece at our next cocktail party.

300
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
"Our next cocktail party"?

301
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
We'll put chips in it.We'll make it a chip chick.

302
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
Do you remember yesterday?

303
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

304
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
Do you remembertalking to me yesterday?

305
00:15:27 --> 00:15:28
So what happened?

306
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!

307
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
Oh, sweet Moses!

308
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
So on this road trip,did you win any money?

309
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!He cleans up!

310
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
$300! He buys me these new shoes.

311
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
Nice.

312
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
See you upstairs. See you, pals!

313
00:15:46 --> 00:15:50
Is anyone else startingto really like him?

314
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
May I help you?

315
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
Why doesn't my key work,and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

316
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:12 --> 00:16:13
Have we met?

318
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
It's Eddie, you freak!Your roommate.

319
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
I'm sorry...

320
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
...I already have a roommate.

321
00:16:25 --> 00:16:30
He's lived here for years.I don't know what you're talking about.

322
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
No, he moved out and I moved in.

323
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
Well, I think we'd remembersomething like that.

324
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
I know I would.

325
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
That's a good point.

326
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
Okay, wow.

327
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

328
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
- I'm terribly sorry.- Hey, no problem.

329
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
See you.

330
00:16:55 --> 00:16:59
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

331
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
- You want me to help you unpack?- Nah, I'm okay.

332
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
Just so you know, I'm notmoving back in because I have to.

333
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
I mean, I do have to, but...

334
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
It's just that that place,it wasn't really...

335
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
I mean, this is...

336
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
Welcome home, man.

337
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
- A little foos?- Absolutely!

338
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
What happened to the foosball?

339
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
It's a cantaloupe.

340
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
Are we gonna bring this outevery time Ross comes over?

341
00:17:36 --> 00:17:39
He paid a lot of money for it.

342
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
I'm gonna hold him a different way.

343
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
If you hated it so much,why'd you buy it in the first place?

344
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
Well, I had a whole ceramiczoo thing going over there.

345
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
But without the other ones,it looks tacky.

346
00:17:55 --> 00:17:58
Is he housetrained or will he leavelittle bathroom tiles all over?

347
00:17:58 --> 00:18:00
Stay.

348
00:18:01 --> 00:18:02
Stay!

349
00:18:02 --> 00:18:05
Good fake dog.
