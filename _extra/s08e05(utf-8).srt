1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
This one's rare.This one's medium. Go!

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
Hey, Phoebe!How was dinner?!

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:10
Dinner was good! Just saying hi!Now I'm gonna go!

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
- Well, hello there.- Hi.

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
I didn't see this on the menu.

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
This is Tim, my new sous chef.

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
- So you're Monica's boss?- No, she's my boss.

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
- "Sous" is French for "under."- I "sous-stand."

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
Tim, I need a caesar salad.And could you get me the pesto?

10
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
- You made pesto?- Yes, I did.

11
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
Would you say your pestois the best-o?

12
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
I don't know.I would say it's pretty good-o.

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
I still need the salad.

14
00:00:39 --> 00:00:40
- Great necklace.- I made it.

15
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
- You are so talented.- Well, it's no pesto.

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
Let's just cut to the chase.You're both single.

17
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
He gets off at 11.Call her.

18
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
I'll give him your number if I couldjust get a caesar salad!

19
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
I did not yell.I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

20
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01

23
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
- Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.- You know me, sir.

24
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
How can I getaround the computer network...

25
00:01:38 --> 00:01:42
...so I can accessthe really good Internet porn?

26
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
You're a joker, Bing.

27
00:01:45 --> 00:01:47
What's funny about that?

28
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
- Sorry I kept you waiting so long.- Where do you wanna go?

29
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
I think you know.

30
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
- The Hard Rock Cafe?- Yeah.

31
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
- Again?- Yeah.

32
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
- I'm telling you, I like the food.- You like the "Purple Rain" display.

33
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
- Hey, Bob.- Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

34
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
- Did that guy just call you Toby?- Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

35
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
- Why don't you correct him?- It's been way too long now.

36
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
The first time, I didn't say anything.

37
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
The next time he said,"Toby, want a doughnut?"

38
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
And I wanted the doughnut.

39
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
Five years later, the doughnut's goneand I'm still Toby.

40
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
- Chandler, you have to tell him.- That would be so awkward.

41
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
We don't work together.He's on the sixth floor.

42
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
So he calls me Toby once in a while.

43
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.

44
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
Muriel.Why would he call you Muriel?

45
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
Oh, my God.

46
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
Chandler "M." Bing.

47
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
It's not just an "M."Your middle name is Muriel!

48
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
It is a family name.

49
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
Chandler Muriel Bing.

50
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
Your parents never evengave you a chance, did they?

51
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
Drake, I've discovered the reasonfor your memory loss.

52
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
Your brain transplantwasn't successful.

53
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.

54
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
Is it serious?

55
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
Not if we extract tissuefrom the original body...

56
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
...and synthesize antibodiesto stop you from rejecting the brain.

57
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
That sounds simple enough.Let's just do that.

58
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
We would, but when we wentto exhume Jessica's body...

59
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
...it was gone.

60
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
Cut.Very nice, people.

61
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
I'll change and we can go.

62
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
- What happened to Jessica's body?- You'll have to see it on TV.

63
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
- You don't know, do you?- Couldn't care less.

64
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
- Good scene, man.- You too.

65
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
What? You weren't in it.

66
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
Kash, this is my friend Rachel.Rachel, Kash.

67
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
- Hi.- Why haven't I seen you here before?

68
00:03:58 --> 00:04:03
Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.

69
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
Which I'm not.I'm not.

70
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
Although, I do know your favoriteice cream flavor is butter pecan.

71
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
And your dog's name is Wally.

72
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
- Look, I'm just stroking your arm.- Let's go!

73
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
Bye, Kash.Say hi to Wally.

74
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
- Monica.- Hi.

75
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
I had the best timewith Tim last night. He is so sweet.

76
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
I can't waitto get "sous-neath" him.

77
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
- I have to fire him.- Why?

78
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
He's terrible.He's slow. He burns things.

79
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
He lit my pastry chef on fire.

80
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
He was nervous.You can be intimidating.

81
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
And your pastry chef can standto be taken down a peg.

82
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
Well, now she has no eyebrows.Mission accomplished.

83
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
But Monica, he loves his job so much.

84
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
Can't you just give himanother chance, please?

85
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
All right. But if he lightssomeone else on fire, he's gone.

86
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
That's fair. Thank you so much.

87
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Looks like he got youa little bit too.

88
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
I paid to have this done.

89
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
Love it!

90
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
Hey. You know,Kash really liked you.

91
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
He thought you were charming.

92
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
- I thought I was an idiot.- I'm with you.

93
00:05:21 --> 00:05:26
- He asked if you'd go out with him.- I think I'm gonna throw up a little.

94
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
- What did you say?- "No."

95
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
What?

96
00:05:29 --> 00:05:34
I figured since you're pregnant,you're not gonna be seeing people.

97
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
First of all, Kash Ford?Not people.

98
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Did you tell him I was pregnant?

99
00:05:40 --> 00:05:45
No. I didn't know if you told people.This was when Kash was still "people."

100
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
- Good. Just have him call me.- I don't think that's...

101
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
Go do it or I'll come backto that set. I'll meet more actors.

102
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
- Hey, Bob.- How's my pal Toby doing today?

103
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
If I see him, I'll ask.

104
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
Was that Bob from sixyou were just talking to?

105
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
- Yeah.- You know him?

106
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
We're on a semi-first-name basis.

107
00:06:08 --> 00:06:12
- What about adding him to our team?- Bob?

108
00:06:12 --> 00:06:17
Working here with us? Every day?I don't know if he has what it takes.

109
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
- They love him down on six.- But this is 11.

110
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
It's almost twice as hard up here.

111
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
- Okay, Bob will stay put.- I think it's best, sir.

112
00:06:26 --> 00:06:32
We do need to find somebody. I've gota stack of documents this high.

113
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
Just toss them in the shredderand claim you never got them.

114
00:06:37 --> 00:06:38
That's a good one, Bing.

115
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
What does a guy have to doto be taken seriously around here?

116
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
I gave him another chance,but Tim has got to go.

117
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
I called the chefwho recommended him to me.

118
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

119
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
- But don't fire him today.- Why?

120
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
- Because I'm dumping him today.- You said he was sweet.

121
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
He's too sweet.He calls me all the time.

122
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
"Did you get home okay?""Was your shower okay?"

123
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
- Don't pick up the phone.- Then he comes over!

124
00:07:11 --> 00:07:12
"I was worried."Be a man!

125
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
So I can't fire him?

126
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
And dump him the same day?He'll kill himself.

127
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
- Go out with him for another week.- Are you kidding? I'll kill myself.

128
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
Then he'll just have to deal with it.

129
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
Okay. But who's gonna go first?Whoever goes second is the bitch.

130
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
- What?- Fire a guy that's just been dumped?

131
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
Bitch!And dump a guy that's just been fired?

132
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
Blond bitch!

133
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
I wanted to do this days ago,so I think I should go first.

134
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
All right, that makes sense.

135
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
But screw you! I'm going first!

136
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
Toby, you got a sec?

137
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
I wanted to get transferred up here,but it's not gonna happen.

138
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
Apparently somebody thinksI'm not "11 th-floor material."

139
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?

140
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
What's the best excuse for whyI'm not drinking?

141
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
"I'm a recovering alcoholic,""I'm a Mormon"...

142
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
...or "I got so hammered last nightI'm still a little drunk"?

143
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
What do you want to do tonight?

144
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
There's a powerful Ukrainian filmplaying. Interested?

145
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
No. But I'll go seea normal-person movie with you.

146
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
- Rach, you wanna come?- I can't. I've got a date.

147
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
- A date?- Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

148
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.It's regular.

149
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
It's mundane.It's actually a little dull.

150
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
It's no Ukrainian film.

151
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
Earrings!

152
00:08:44 --> 00:08:49
- She's got a date? With who?- I set her up with this actor.

153
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
- You set her up?- No.

154
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
- What were you thinking?- That it was okay...

155
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
...because you two haven't datedin years.

156
00:08:58 --> 00:09:03
I'm worried about my baby.Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

157
00:09:03 --> 00:09:08
- Where is this "actor" taking them?- Hey! I'm an "actor" too.

158
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
They're taking the ferryto a place on Staten Island.

159
00:09:12 --> 00:09:17
My baby's going on a ferry? Do youhave any idea how dangerous those are?

160
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
Aren't we talking aboutthose big boats that go really slow?

161
00:09:20 --> 00:09:25
Why not just jump out of an airplaneor burn each other with matches?

162
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
- Hey, Joey.- Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.

163
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
Hey, I hear you're goingon a ferry tonight.

164
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
Bit of a daredevil, are we?

165
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
Do you guys think this is too slutty?Hi, Kash.

166
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
- Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?- Yeah. See you guys later.

167
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
Have a great time, you guys.And yes, it is too slutty!

168
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
I'm glad you called.I feel like I'm always calling you.

169
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
What's up?Is everything okay with Phoebe?

170
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
It will be in a minute.

171
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
- Tim, you're a really great guy.- That's because I'm with you.

172
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
It's just, I'm in a place in my liferight now where...

173
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
So sorry. "This just in."

174
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
It's the restaurant.Monica needs me.

175
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
No, she doesn't! I know what that is.You can stay.

176
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

177
00:10:29 --> 00:10:33
And I will be holding you right here.

178
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
What movie do you wanna see?And not one I have to read.

179
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
I get that from books.

180
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
- Books?- Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes...

181
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
...but it's enough!

182
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
Let's not see a movie.We'll just stay here and hang.

183
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
- Just wait for Rachel to come back?- Hey, if that's what you wanna do.

184
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
Dude, what is going on?

185
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
- I have to find out how it went.- Why?

186
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
- He could be my baby's stepfather.- One date and they're getting married?

187
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
He's not you!

188
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
I can't believe she's dating!

189
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
- What did you think she was gonna do?- I don't know.

190
00:11:17 --> 00:11:21
- I can't believe this is happening.- What do you mean?

191
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
I thought when I had another kid,it'd be different.

192
00:11:25 --> 00:11:30
I love Ben. But every timeI drop him off at Carol and Susan's...

193
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
...it breaks my heart a little.

194
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
I've always had this pictureof me and my next wife in bed...

195
00:11:36 --> 00:11:41
...my kid comes running in, leaps upon the bed and we all read the paper.

196
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
Maybe fight over the science section.

197
00:11:44 --> 00:11:49
- That's nice. You can still have that.- No. Rachel's out with some guy.

198
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
My baby went with her.

199
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
If anything, that picturekeeps moving further away.

200
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
Hey, can I ask you something?

201
00:11:59 --> 00:12:04
In this picture of you and your wife,is your wife Rachel?

202
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
It used to be.

203
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
Now she doesn't really have a face.

204
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
Smokin' body, though.

205
00:12:14 --> 00:12:18
Good call. But the face, Ross,the face isn't Rachel.

206
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
No. But how much easier would it beif it were?

207
00:12:22 --> 00:12:23
That's not what she wants.

208
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
I know. And I can't force myselfto fall in love with her.

209
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.

210
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
It won't be what you thought.But no matter what...

211
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
...there's gonna bea brand-new little baby. Your baby.

212
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
Who cares what the picture looks like?

213
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
Let's you and me go outand have some fun.

214
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
Whatever you want. Come on.

215
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51

216
00:12:53 --> 00:12:54
- Hey, Toby?- Hey, Bobby.

217
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57

Right there.Let me ask you, why?

221
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
I wanna talk to that bastard,see what his problem is.

222
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15

223
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
- Toby, don't.- Bob.

224
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
Toby, I'm not gonna let you coverfor him.

225
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Anything you say will just get memore upset with Chandler.

226
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
That puts mein a difficult position.

227
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
- Is everything okay?- That depends.

228
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
