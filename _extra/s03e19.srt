-Here you go.[br]-Thank you.

00:00:07.10,00:00:08.17

20

"Say, Rachel...

21



22

00:00:08.42,00:00:11.34

23

...l was wondering if you'd[br]go to a movie with me sometime...

24



25

00:00:11.54,00:00:13.02

26

...as my lover. "

27



28

00:00:16.22,00:00:17.37

29

Too out there.

30



31

00:00:17.62,00:00:20.30

32

"Maybe you'd like to have[br]dinner with me sometime...

33



34

00:00:21.18,00:00:22.58

35

...as my lover. "

36



37

00:00:26.74,00:00:28.38

38

All right, let's go shopping.

39



40

00:00:28.66,00:00:31.18

41

Before we go, there's something[br]I need to say.

42



43

00:00:36.62,00:00:39.06

44

I've kind of had this crush on you.

45



46

00:00:40.14,00:00:42.86

47

Since you were with Ross,[br]I didn't do anything about it.

48



49

00:00:43.10,00:00:46.86

50

Now that you're not, I'd really[br]like to ask you out sometime.

51



52

00:00:47.50,00:00:49.46

53

So that's what I'm doing. . .

54



55

00:00:49.78,00:00:50.61

56

: : :now:

57



58

00:01:06.30,00:01:07.58

59

I dropped a cup.

71

. . .will be standard[br]on any computer.

72



73

00:02:02.18,00:02:06.50

74

You know, so you could be, like,[br]"Wash my car. " "Clean my room. "

75



76

00:02:06.70,00:02:10.33

77

It won't be able to do any of those[br]things, but it'll understand.

78



79

00:02:11.74,00:02:12.97

80

Oh, this was so great.

81



82

00:02:13.18,00:02:14.46

83

Yeah, it was.

84



85

00:02:16.14,00:02:17.21

86

All right, then.

87



88

00:02:18.78,00:02:20.06

89

Bye.

90



91

00:02:25.58,00:02:28.14

92

Hello, people who do not live here.

93



94

00:02:32.22,00:02:34.37

95

I gave you a key for emergencies.

96



97

00:02:34.62,00:02:36.62

98

We were out of Doritos.

99



100

00:02:38.14,00:02:40.74

101

Hey, how'd the date go[br]with Mr. Millionaire?

102



103

00:02:40.94,00:02:43.94

104

"Mr. Millionaire.[br]New, from Snooty Playthings.

105



106

00:02:44.78,00:02:46.58

107

Third wife sold separately. "

108



109

00:02:47.54,00:02:50.26

110

He's great. We have such[br]a good time together.

111



112

00:02:50.50,00:02:55.34

113

He's so funny and so sweet.[br]And I'm not attracted to him at all!

114



115

00:02:55.74,00:02:56.73

116

Still?

117



118

00:02:57.66,00:03:01.13

119

It's driving me crazy. In every[br]other way, he's the perfect guy.

120



121

00:03:01.34,00:03:05.18

122

He has everything.[br]Plus, he actually has everything.

123



124

00:03:05.82,00:03:08.78

125

Life-sized lmperial Storm Troopers[br]from Sharper lmage?

126



127

00:03:09.02,00:03:10.42

128

Two.

129



130

00:03:10.98,00:03:13.05

131

Can Joey and I put them on and fight?

132



133

00:03:15.42,00:03:19.46

134

Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy![br]I am a big old baddy

135



136

00:03:20.22,00:03:23.74

137

Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy![br]I am a big old baddy

138



139

00:03:27.54,00:03:30.62

140

I guess he must've gotten the part[br]in that play.

141



142

00:03:30.82,00:03:32.74

143

Either that, or Gloria Estefan[br]was right.

144



145

00:03:32.98,00:03:35.34

146

Eventually, the rhythm[br]is going to get you.

147



148

00:03:41.02,00:03:42.98

149

-Joe, how's it going?[br]-Good.

150



151

00:03:50.30,00:03:51.86

152

So you're playing Adrianne?

153



154

00:03:52.10,00:03:54.49

155

Yes. Are you one of the[br]retarded cousins?

156



157

00:03:56.62,00:04:00.06

158

No. I'm playing your husband, victor.[br]I'm Joey Tribbiani.

159



160

00:04:00.30,00:04:02.53

161

Hi. Nice to meet you.[br]Kate Miller.

162



163

00:04:09.22,00:04:11.53

164

So the play's pretty great, huh?

165



166

00:04:11.78,00:04:14.14

167

Oh, yeah.[br]I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

168



169

00:04:14.38,00:04:18.34

170

She's so incisive when it comes[br]to deconstructing the middle class.

171



172

00:04:18.54,00:04:20.69

173

Oh, forget about it. She rocks!

174



175

00:04:26.10,00:04:28.14

176

Where do I know you from?

177



178

00:04:29.62,00:04:31.22

179

Dr. Drake Ramoray?

180



181

00:04:32.54,00:04:33.82

182

Days of our Lives?

183



184

00:04:34.30,00:04:36.98

185

voted most datable neurosurgeon[br]by Teen Beat?

186



187

00:04:38.30,00:04:39.82

188

No, that's not it.

189



190

00:04:40.82,00:04:42.54

191

So you're a soap actor.

192



193

00:04:42.74,00:04:45.86

194

This must be exciting for you,[br]being in a real play.

195



196

00:04:46.06,00:04:48.74

197

Hey, I've done plays before.[br]I'm a serious actor.

198



199

00:04:50.14,00:04:51.18

200

That infomercial!

201



202

00:04:53.38,00:04:55.18

203

For the milk-carton-spout thing!

204



205

00:04:55.42,00:04:57.89

206

You're the guy who doesn't[br]know how to pour milk!

207



208

00:04:59.42,00:05:03.50

209

I actually can pour milk. But I got[br]you believing that I couldn't.

210



211

00:05:03.70,00:05:05.26

212

Now, see, that's acting.

213



214

00:05:05.90,00:05:08.54

215

Right. At the end, you choked[br]on a cookie.

216



217

00:05:08.98,00:05:09.86

218

That was real.

219



220

00:05:12.10,00:05:15.18

221

-I cannot believe Mark asked you out.[br]-I know.

222



223

00:05:15.42,00:05:17.14

224

What are you gonna tell him?

225



226

00:05:17.34,00:05:21.18

227

I told him I would think about it,[br]but I'm gonna tell him no.

228



229

00:05:23.42,00:05:25.94

230

I think I'd say no[br]to anybody right now.

231



232

00:05:29.10,00:05:32.18

233

But it was so strange.[br]I mean, I'm standing there. . .

234



235

00:05:32.42,00:05:36.54

236

. . .with this charming, cute guy[br]who's asking me to go out with him. . .

237



238

00:05:36.74,00:05:38.54

239

. . .which I'm allowed to do. . .

240



241

00:05:38.78,00:05:42.57

242

. . .and I felt guilty, like I'd be[br]cheating on Ross or something.

243



244

00:05:43.18,00:05:46.18

245

Wow. So, okay, maybe that means. . .

246



247

00:05:46.38,00:05:50.14

248

. . .you're not over Ross yet[br]and you have issues with your father.

249



250

00:05:53.98,00:05:57.58

251

-I don't have issues with my father.[br]-So it's just the Ross thing.

252



253

00:05:59.82,00:06:01.74

254

I hate this woman! I hate her!

255



256

00:06:01.94,00:06:04.33

257

She told everyone[br]about that infomercial. . .

258



259

00:06:04.54,00:06:07.54

260

. . .and now they all keep asking me[br]to open their drinks!

261



262

00:06:07.78,00:06:11.86

263

And whenever I can't do it,[br]they're all, like, laughing at me!

264



265

00:06:17.02,00:06:18.50

266

So Rachel called.

267



268

00:06:19.78,00:06:21.10

269

Wants to see me.

270



271

00:06:22.54,00:06:24.02

272

Going over in a minute.

273



274

00:06:24.74,00:06:29.14

275

-What do you think she wants?[br]-Maybe the crazy fog has lifted. . .

276



277

00:06:29.38,00:06:32.30

278

. . .and she realizes that life[br]without me. . .

279



280

00:06:32.78,00:06:33.58

281

. . .sucks.

282



283

00:06:34.82,00:06:39.53

284

It's possible. You are very lovable.[br]I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

285



286

00:06:40.58,00:06:42.22

287

Just trying to be supportive.

288



289

00:06:43.34,00:06:45.10

290

Be supportive like a guy.

291



292

00:06:46.26,00:06:48.54

293

If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.

294



295

00:06:56.74,00:06:58.18

296

You wanted to see me?

297



298

00:07:03.14,00:07:05.53

299

Here's a box of your stuff.

300



301

00:07:09.14,00:07:13.70

302

It's just hats and a shirt and CDS.[br]Just stuff that you've left here.

303



304

00:07:14.30,00:07:17.54

305

What are you doing? Are you trying[br]to hurt me or something?

306



307

00:07:23.42,00:07:27.13

308

It just seems that, you know,[br]it's time we move on.

309



310

00:07:27.38,00:07:28.78

311

I mean, don't you think?

312



313

00:07:32.22,00:07:33.66

314

-Yes, I do.[br]-Good.

315



316

00:07:34.38,00:07:35.86

317

I really do.

318



319

00:07:39.54,00:07:41.46

320

This was a gift.

321



322

00:07:41.66,00:07:44.54

323

You got that for free[br]from the museum gift shop.

324



325

00:07:45.02,00:07:46.54

326

It's still a gift.

327



328

00:07:46.78,00:07:49.17

329

I got it from the "gift" shop.

330



331

00:07:50.82,00:07:53.74

332

Okay! All right! Give me the mug![br]I'll keep the mug!

333



334

00:07:53.98,00:07:55.38

335

Don't do me any favors.

336



337

00:07:55.62,00:07:56.98

338

In fact. . .

339



340

00:07:57.70,00:08:00.26

341

. . .where's the rest of my stuff?[br]Like my. . . .

342



343

00:08:02.58,00:08:04.14

344

This book is mine!

345



346

00:08:06.82,00:08:10.86

347

And that T-shirt you sleep in?[br]I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.

348



349

00:08:12.62,00:08:16.94

350

You know how much I love that T-shirt.[br]You never even wear that T-shirt.

351



352

00:08:17.30,00:08:19.66

353

I'm just trying to help you "move on. "

354



355

00:08:20.62,00:08:23.06

356

Oh, you are a petty man.

357



358

00:08:23.30,00:08:25.34

359

You are a petty, petty. . .

360



361

00:08:25.54,00:08:26.94

362

-Petty. . .[br]-. . . petty, petty. . .

363



364

00:08:27.18,00:08:28.38

365

-. . .small. . . .[br]-. . .small. . . .

366



367

00:08:32.26,00:08:35.34

368

You are so just doing this[br]out of spite.

369



370

00:08:36.46,00:08:39.38

371

I'm gonna wear this all the time![br]I love this shirt!

372



373

00:08:40.02,00:08:44.89

374

You haven't worn it since you were 1 5![br]It doesn't even fit you anymore!

375



376

00:08:59.62,00:09:02.93

377

If you don't mind, I'm gonna[br]take the rest of my stuff. . .

378



379

00:09:03.42,00:09:05.02

380

. . .and "relax" . . .

381



382

00:09:06.30,00:09:08.26

383

. . .in my favorite shirt.

384



385

00:09:10.14,00:09:12.14

386

You have a pleasant evening.

387



388

00:09:21.54,00:09:23.34

389

So you're, like, a zillionaire.

390



391

00:09:25.06,00:09:27.26

392

And you're our age.[br]You're our age.

393



394

00:09:27.98,00:09:30.45

395

You know what?[br]You should buy a state. . .

396



397

00:09:30.70,00:09:32.82

398

. . .and then just name it[br]after yourself.

399



400

00:09:33.42,00:09:34.70

401

Like, "Pete Dakota"?

402



403

00:09:36.38,00:09:37.94

404

Or "Mississi-Pete. "

405



406

00:09:39.78,00:09:42.22

407

I got it: "Pete Chicago. "

408



409

00:09:44.14,00:09:45.98

410

That's not a state, Joe.

411



412

00:09:46.42,00:09:48.73

413

Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

414



415

00:09:50.74,00:09:52.10

416

I gotta go.

417



418

00:09:52.70,00:09:54.14

419

I'll see you guys later.

420



421

00:09:54.34,00:09:55.86

422

You're our age.

423



424

00:09:58.22,00:09:59.86

425

So are we on for tomorrow?

426



427

00:10:00.10,00:10:01.33

428

Absolutely.

429



430

00:10:03.14,00:10:05.34

431

Now, get out of here, you!

432



433

00:10:11.38,00:10:14.34

434

Okay, I'm running out of places[br]I can touch him.

435



436

00:10:14.98,00:10:16.42

437

Is something wrong with me?

438



439

00:10:16.66,00:10:19.26

440

Why am I only attracted to guys[br]with no future?

441



442

00:10:19.50,00:10:22.02

443

Either they're too old,[br]or they're too young.

444



445

00:10:22.26,00:10:24.26

446

And there's Pete,[br]who's crazy about me. . .

447



448

00:10:24.50,00:10:27.74

449

. . .and he's absolutely perfect,[br]and there's zip going on!

450



451

00:10:27.94,00:10:30.06

452

Does it sound like[br]something's wrong with me?

453



454

00:10:30.30,00:10:31.42

455

Yeah, kind of.

456



457

00:10:34.54,00:10:37.34

458

Happy? ls that what I'm[br]supposed to be, vic?

459



460

00:10:37.58,00:10:38.78

461

Happy?

462



463

00:10:39.02,00:10:41.54

464

Why don't you tell me what[br]you're supposed to be?

465



466

00:10:41.74,00:10:43.94

467

Because I sure as hell can't[br]figure it out!

468



469

00:10:44.14,00:10:46.34

470

I talk to you, and nothing!

471



472

00:10:46.58,00:10:48.58

473

You look at me, and it's nothing!

474



475

00:10:52.10,00:10:53.25

476

Nothing.

477



478

00:10:55.82,00:10:56.81

479

Tasty.

480



481

00:10:58.46,00:11:02.42

482

I'm really starting to feel like[br]you guys have a history. It's nice.

483



484

00:11:02.66,00:11:04.58

485

I have a question about this scene.

486



487

00:11:05.70,00:11:09.22

488

I don't understand why Adrianne's[br]attracted to victor.

489



490

00:11:09.46,00:11:11.14

491

Peel the onion.

492



493

00:11:12.22,00:11:14.10

494

First of all, he's good-looking.

495



496

00:11:15.82,00:11:18.58

497

My character needs a bit more[br]of a reason than that.

498



499

00:11:18.82,00:11:21.98

500

Hey, how about this one?[br]It says so in the script!

501



502

00:11:24.82,00:11:27.54

503

I don't know why my character[br]likes you either.

504



505

00:11:27.78,00:11:30.54

506

I mean, it says in the script[br]that you're a bitch.

507



508

00:11:31.42,00:11:34.54

509

-It doesn't say that in the script.[br]-It does in mine.

510



511

00:11:37.34,00:11:39.98

512

I can blow-dry it, gel it.[br]It doesn't matter.

513



514

00:11:40.22,00:11:41.94

515

I still wind up with this little. . .

516



517

00:11:42.18,00:11:46.38

518

. . .cowlick-y thing on the middle part[br]of my head. It's so annoying.

519



520

00:11:46.58,00:11:48.70

521

-Does it bug you?[br]-You bug me.

522



523

00:12:01.50,00:12:04.30

524

Is there any chance[br]you didn't see that?

525



526

00:12:07.78,00:12:09.93

527

Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

528



529

00:12:10.18,00:12:12.94

530

You can't stare through[br]the peephole for three hours.

531



532

00:12:15.54,00:12:17.06

533

You're gonna get peep-eye.

534



535

00:12:18.14,00:12:20.94

536

I knew it. I knew it.[br]I always knew she liked him.

537



538

00:12:21.30,00:12:25.74

539

She'd say no, but here we are. We just[br]broke up, first thing she does!

540



541

00:12:25.94,00:12:27.38

542

You didn't "just break up. "

543



544

00:12:27.62,00:12:29.38

545

It's been, like, three weeks!

546



547

00:12:29.62,00:12:33.38

548

You slept with somebody three hours[br]after you thought you broke up.

549



550

00:12:33.62,00:12:35.82

551

I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

552



553

00:12:37.38,00:12:39.02

554

Here they come! Here they--

555



556

00:12:39.34,00:12:42.02

557

If she kisses him good night,[br]I'll kill myself.

558



559

00:12:42.26,00:12:43.70

560

I can't watch.

561



562

00:12:44.94,00:12:46.86

563

Come on.[br]Date over! Date over!

564



565

00:12:47.62,00:12:49.74

566

Here we go. She's going in.

567



568

00:12:50.46,00:12:51.53

569

She's going in.

570



571

00:12:51.78,00:12:53.54

572

Wait! He's going in!

573



574

00:12:54.82,00:12:55.94

575

He's going in!

576



577

00:12:56.38,00:13:00.14

578

The door's closed! I can't see[br]anything with the door closed!

579



580

00:13:00.42,00:13:03.94

581

And the inventor of the door[br]rests happily in his grave.

582



583

00:13:04.42,00:13:06.73

584

I have to do something.[br]I have to stop it!

585



586

00:13:06.98,00:13:08.78

587

-Stop what?[br]-I don't know.

588



589

00:13:09.02,00:13:11.49

590

But I have a feeling[br]my being there will do it.

591



592

00:13:11.70,00:13:13.98

593

I'll go over and I will[br]borrow something!

594



595

00:13:14.34,00:13:15.98

596

Juice! I need juice!

597



598

00:13:16.22,00:13:17.10

599

You can't!

600



601

00:13:18.22,00:13:20.37

602

-They must be stopped![br]-I am your friend. . .

603



604

00:13:20.62,00:13:22.46

605

. . .and I won't let you do this!

606



607

00:13:22.74,00:13:24.89

608

You are surprisingly strong!

609



610

00:13:25.78,00:13:29.14

611

-I need juice! People need juice![br]-Look, man. . . .

612



613

00:13:29.34,00:13:31.22

614

-People need juice![br]-Listen to me!

615



616

00:13:35.82,00:13:39.86

617

She's moving on. If it's not[br]this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

618



619

00:13:40.10,00:13:42.94

620

And unless you're thinking about[br]subletting my peephole. . .

621



622

00:13:43.14,00:13:46.22

623

. . .you'll have to get used to the fact[br]that it's over!

624



625

00:13:46.46,00:13:49.06

626

Okay, man? It's over.

627



628

00:13:55.62,00:13:57.82

629

It's just I miss her so much.

630



631

00:13:59.22,00:14:00.29

632

I know.

633



634

00:14:03.02,00:14:05.17

635

Why do your coffee mugs have numbers?

636



637

00:14:05.42,00:14:07.94

638

Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

639



640

00:14:08.18,00:14:11.73

641

So if one of them's missing,[br]she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

642



643

00:14:20.50,00:14:21.38

644

You know what?

645



646

00:14:21.62,00:14:24.22

647

No, and I don't think[br]I'm gonna want to.

648



649

00:14:24.98,00:14:28.42

650

-I can't do this.[br]-That's what I didn't want to know.

651



652

00:14:28.82,00:14:32.58

653

Oh, I'm just doing this[br]for the wrong reasons, you know?

654



655

00:14:32.78,00:14:34.70

656

I'm doing it to get back at Ross.

657



658

00:14:34.90,00:14:37.37

659

I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

660



661

00:14:40.34,00:14:41.94

662

Fair, shmair. You know?

663



664

00:14:42.14,00:14:45.18

665

You wanna get back at Ross,[br]I am here for you.

666



667

00:14:46.38,00:14:47.42

668

Really.

669



670

00:14:47.66,00:14:52.14

671

I say we get back at him right here[br]on this couch. Right here!

672



673

00:14:53.82,00:14:55.78

674

Oh, my God.

675



676

00:14:57.50,00:14:58.94

677

I'm sorry about this.

678



679

00:15:00.42,00:15:01.49

680

That's okay.

681



682

00:15:03.54,00:15:04.34

683

You sure?

684



685

00:15:07.38,00:15:10.38

686

I can just go home and get back[br]at him by myself.

687



688

00:15:13.98,00:15:16.86

689

--and should become the penicillin[br]of the 2 1st century.

690



691

00:15:17.10,00:15:20.73

692

And so today, this hospital[br]is about to take major steps. . .

693



694

00:15:20.98,00:15:23.29

695

. . .toward leading that revolution.

696



697

00:15:24.98,00:15:26.46

698

Can I ask you something?

699



700

00:15:30.42,00:15:31.25

701

Where are we?

702



703

00:15:32.22,00:15:35.34

704

Well, with all these doctors[br]and nurses. . .

705



706

00:15:35.58,00:15:37.46

707

. . .I'm gonna say, "Midget Rodeo. "

708



709

00:15:38.50,00:15:39.86

710

Just tell me the truth.

711



712

00:15:45.18,00:15:47.74

713

You know, I don't think[br]I told you this. . .

714



715

00:15:47.94,00:15:51.18

716

. . .but I just recently got out[br]of a serious relationship.

717



718

00:15:51.42,00:15:53.62

719

Oh, right.[br]Wasn't that a year ago?

720



721

00:15:55.62,00:15:57.14

722

So I did tell you.

723



724

00:15:57.90,00:15:59.78

725

That's not really the thing.

726



727

00:16:00.02,00:16:04.81

728

I'm just in a place in my life[br]where I need to focus on me.

729



730

00:16:05.34,00:16:07.38

731

-Do you know what I mean?[br]-Oh, I know.

732



733

00:16:09.54,00:16:13.78

734

-I so want to be attracted to you.[br]-But you're not. Okay. Good.

735



736

00:16:14.02,00:16:15.17

737

I'm sorry.

738



739

00:16:17.54,00:16:19.34

740

You know what? Don't be.

741



742

00:16:20.30,00:16:22.37

743

Don't be, because it's not so bad.

744



745

00:16:23.14,00:16:23.94

746

It's not?

747



748

00:16:24.14,00:16:26.58

749

Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

750



751

00:16:28.90,00:16:31.21

752

Or someone you find attractive.

753



754

00:16:32.22,00:16:34.18

755

I just think, you know. . .

756



757

00:16:34.42,00:16:37.89

758

. . .that you might end up[br]feeling differently.

759



760

00:16:41.22,00:16:43.98

761

I don't want this[br]to come out wrong. . .

762



763

00:16:44.18,00:16:47.97

764

. . .but you're awfully confident for a[br]guy I said I wasn't attracted to.

765



766

00:16:48.22,00:16:50.34

767

Stupidly charming, isn't it?

768



769

00:16:52.90,00:16:56.69

770

You wanna get something to eat?[br]This place is kind of depressing.

771



772

00:16:57.70,00:17:02.49

773

Now the man who made all of this[br]possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

774



775

00:17:03.06,00:17:04.10

776

One second.

777



778

00:17:11.54,00:17:16.06

779

I don't think this town is big enough[br]for the both of us to relax in.

780



781

00:17:19.18,00:17:20.33

782

Draw!

783



784

00:17:24.02,00:17:25.58

785

I wasn't doing anything.

786



787

00:17:32.54,00:17:34.18

788

What did she do now?

789



790

00:17:34.42,00:17:38.94

791

Just because she went to Yale, she[br]thinks she's the greatest actress. . .

792



793

00:17:39.14,00:17:41.29

794

. . .since sliced bread.

795



796

00:17:42.30,00:17:45.34

797

Ah, Sliced Bread.[br]A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

798



799

00:17:46.02,00:17:49.57

800

I hate her. I hate her[br]with her "Oh, I'm so talented" . . .

801



802

00:17:49.82,00:17:53.53

803

. . .and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"[br]and "Oh, I smell so good. "

804



805

00:17:54.50,00:17:56.73

806

I think somebody has a crush[br]on somebody.

807



808

00:17:56.98,00:18:00.86

809

Can we please try and stay focused[br]on my problem here?

810



811

00:18:01.38,00:18:04.30

812

I'm talking about you,[br]you big, big freak.

813



814

00:18:08.42,00:18:10.14

815

You're out of your mind!

816



817

00:18:10.38,00:18:12.98

818

You've done nothing but talk[br]about her for 48 hours.

819



820

00:18:13.18,00:18:17.74

821

If you were in school, you'd be pulling[br]her pigtails and pushing her down now.

822



823

00:18:17.94,00:18:20.17

824

Then how come I keep thinking[br]about her. . .

825



826

00:18:20.42,00:18:23.18

827

. . .in all these sexual scenarios[br]and stuff?

828



829

00:18:29.34,00:18:33.18

830

Happy? ls that what I'm[br]supposed to be, vic? Happy?

831



832

00:18:33.42,00:18:36.18

833

Why don't you tell me what[br]you're supposed to be, huh?

834



835

00:18:36.42,00:18:38.65

836

Because I sure as hell can't[br]figure it out.

837



838

00:18:38.90,00:18:40.90

839

I talk to you, and it's nothing.

840



841

00:18:41.42,00:18:43.65

842

You look at me, and nothing.

843



844

00:18:56.50,00:18:57.65

845

Nothing.

846



847

00:18:59.70,00:19:03.09

848

You guys make me fly!

849



850

00:19:05.62,00:19:06.90

851

High!

852



853

00:19:08.02,00:19:10.74

854

Okay, we're gonna pick it up[br]here, tomorrow.

855



856

00:19:12.90,00:19:15.18

857

-Well, that was. . . .[br]-Better?

858



859

00:19:16.22,00:19:18.45

860

Yeah, it was definitely. . .

861



862

00:19:18.70,00:19:20.18

863

. . .an improvement.

864



865

00:19:21.62,00:19:23.46

866

-Good night.[br]-Kate.

867



868

00:19:25.54,00:19:26.77

869

You forgot your shoes.

870



871

00:19:29.22,00:19:31.69

872

I'm probably gonna need those, huh?

873



874

00:19:36.42,00:19:37.70

875

Hey, listen. . .

876



877

00:19:38.82,00:19:40.94

878

. . .you feel like getting[br]a cup of coffee?

879



880

00:19:42.42,00:19:43.33

881

Kate. . .

882



883

00:19:43.54,00:19:44.45

884

. . .you ready to go?

885



886

00:19:47.10,00:19:49.38

887

very nice. very nice.

888



889

00:19:54.38,00:19:56.18

890

-See you tomorrow?[br]-Yeah. Sure.

891



892

00:19:56.42,00:19:57.74

893

-Right.[br]-Good night.

894



895

00:20:10.50,00:20:12.30

896

Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

897



898

00:20:12.90,00:20:14.66

899

Like Goldman, Silverman?

900



901

00:20:15.54,00:20:17.74

902

Because it's not his last name.

903



904

00:20:18.22,00:20:19.02

905

It isn't?

906



907

00:20:19.26,00:20:20.94

908

It's not, like. . .

909



910

00:20:21.14,00:20:22.74

911

. . .Phil Spiderman.

912



913

00:20:25.62,00:20:26.74

914

He's a Spider-. . .

915



916

00:20:26.98,00:20:28.54

917

: : :man:

918



919

00:20:29.58,00:20:32.46

920

You know, like, Goldman[br]is a last name.

921



922

00:20:32.70,00:20:35.09

923

But there's no Gold Man.

924



925

00:20:37.62,00:20:39.22

926

There should be a Gold Man!

927



928

00:20:43.54,00:20:44.94

929

-How was work?[br]-Oh, great.

930



931

00:20:45.18,00:20:47.94

932

Although I did sit down[br]where there wasn't a chair.

933



934

00:20:48.82,00:20:51.13

935

By the way, Ross dropped by[br]a box of your stuff.

936



937

00:20:51.38,00:20:54.30

938

Oh. Well, I guess I had[br]that one coming.

939



940

00:20:55.02,00:20:58.22

941

I'm just gonna throw it out.[br]It's probably just shampoo and--

942



943

00:21:00.02,00:21:01.22

944

Something wrong?

945



946

00:21:10.38,00:21:11.82

947

No. Nothing.

948



949

00:21:18.70,00:21:22.14

950

So what kind of powers[br]would "Gold Man" have?

951



952

00:21:23.30,00:21:26.34

953

Okay. Well, he would turn things[br]to gold.

954



955

00:21:26.94,00:21:30.90

956

-And things that are already gold?[br]-His work is done.

957



958

00:21:32.50,00:21:33.65

959

Let's play my game.

960



961

00:21:35.10,00:21:38.57

962

All right, you yellow-bellied,[br]lily-livered--

963



964

00:21:38.82,00:21:39.78

965

Draw!

966



967

00:21:43.38,00:21:44.21

968

Yeah, it's fun.

969
