1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
To his team gave a whistle

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
Like the down of a thistle

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
Ere he drove out of sight

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:15
And to all a good night. "

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
Wow! That was great!You really wrote that?

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
Say goodbye, elves.I'm off to Tulsa.

7
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
I can't believe you won't be herefor Christmas.

8
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
You're really not coming back?

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
We have this paperwork that needsto be filed by the end of the year.

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
- Lf I don't get it done, I'll be fired.- It's so unfair.

11
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
- You don't even like your job.- So. Who does?

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
- I like my job.- I love my job.

13
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
- I can't wait to go back to work.- I can't get enough dinosaurs.

14
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
I'm sorry I won't be here.

15
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
It's hard enough not seeing youduring the week...

16
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
...but for Christmas...

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
If this is what you have to do,I understand.

18
00:00:52 --> 00:00:53
Thanks.

19
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
I'll see you New Year's Day.

20
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
You're not gonna be hereNew Year's Eve?

21
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
- Did I not mention that?- No.

22
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
And to all a good night!

26
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
All right, everybody.I know it is Christmas Eve...

27
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
...and you'd rather be with family,but there is no call for writing...

28
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
..."Screw you, Mr. Bing"on the back of my chair.

29
00:01:55 --> 00:01:56
By the way,you can all call me Chandler.

30
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
- Hey.- Hey. Where you been?

31
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
I was checking out that insurancecompany's Christmas party on three.

32
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
It was really beautiful. They havedecorations and this huge tree.

33
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
And I just thought,to hell with them, we have to work.

34
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
So I stole their ham.

35
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
Hear that?You may not be with your families...

36
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
...but at least it's gonna smell like hamin here.

37
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
My kid's in a play right now.

38
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
You know what?I know what will cheer you up.

39
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
I had a talk with the boys in New York.I told them about all your hard work...

40
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
...and that a little Christmas bonusmay be in order.

41
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
"A donation has been made in your nameto the New York City Ballet."

42
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
Well, that's like money in your pocket.

43
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
All right, you want me to say it?This sucks.

44
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Being here sucks. This work sucks!

45
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Now it feels like Christmas.

46
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
At least you get to go homeand be with your families tonight.

48
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
I have to go to an empty hotel roomand lay down...

49
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
...on a very questionable bedspread.

50
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
Then tomorrow, you get to haveChristmas in your own houses.

51
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
Which, by the way,none of you have invited me to.

52
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
- You can come to my house.- No, thanks.

53
00:03:00 --> 00:03:01
- It was a nice pep talk.- Thanks.

54
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
I'm actually thinking about becominga motivational speaker.

55
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
So if you were home right now,what would you be doing?

56
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
Typical Christmassy stuff, you know.Our holidays are pretty traditional.

57
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
So here's a very specialholiday song...

58
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
...that I wrote for somevery important people to me.

59
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Happy holidays, everybody.

60
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
Pheebs, look in the kitchen.I'll look in the back closet.

61
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
I can save you time, ladies.I'm right here.

62
00:04:09 --> 00:04:10
Yeah. Chandler,why don't you take a walk.

63
00:04:11 --> 00:04:12
This doesn't concern you.

64
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
We are looking forour Christmas presents from Monica.

65
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
- What? That's terrible.- No, no. We do it every year.

66
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
Well, that makes it not terrible.

67
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
No. Yeah, we never find them.She's always bested us, that wily...

68
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
...minx.

69
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
We're gonna search herefor an hour...

70
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
...and then we'll go to Joey'sand search. Okay?

71
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
No, not okay.You can't look for Monica's presents.

72
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
- No, we have to.- No, you don't have to.

73
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
And you can't,because I live here too.

74
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
- Well, then you should look with us.- Why?

75
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
Aren't you worried about whatto get Monica for Christmas?

76
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
No, I have a great ideafor a present for her.

77
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
That's it? "A great idea"?

78
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
That's not enough.What if she gets you a great present...

79
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
...two medium presentsand lots of little presents...

80
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
...and you got her one great present?That's gonna make her feel bad.

81
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Why would you do that to her?Why? Why?

82
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
- Lf I helped, we could find them faster!- Right.

83
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
- We have a live one!- It's a Macy's bag!

84
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
Who's it for?

85
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
"Dear Losers: Do you really thinkI'd hide presents under the couch?

86
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
P.S. Chandler,I knew they'd break you."

87
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
Rach, these are for you.

88
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.

89
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
No, but with this new-car smell,you'll think you do.

90
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

91
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
Toilet seat covers!

92
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
Is that what you were doingwhile I was getting gas?

93
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
You guys.

94
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet Tooth.

95
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54
- You got me a cola drink?- And... a lemon-lime!

96
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
Well, this... This is too much.

97
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
I feel like I should get youanother sweater.

98
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
And last but not least...

99
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
They're ribbed, for your pleasure.

100
00:06:08 --> 00:06:09
Well, hey, Ben?

101
00:06:09 --> 00:06:14
What if the Holiday Armadillotold you all about the Festival of Lights?

102
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
Cool!

103
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
Come on, Ben.

104
00:06:19 --> 00:06:25
Years and years ago, there werethese people called the Maccabees!

105
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
Merry Christmas!

106
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
Santa!

107
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
What are you doing here, Santa?

108
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.

109
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
What are you doing here...

110
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
...weird turtle-man?

111
00:06:44 --> 00:06:50
I'm the Holiday Armadillo,your part-Jewish friend.

112
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
You sent me here to give Bensome presents.

113
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
Remember?

114
00:06:57 --> 00:06:58
What?

115
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
Ben, why don't you opensome more presents.

116
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
Santa, the armadillo and Iwill have a talk in the kitchen.

117
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
There's a sentence I never thoughtI'd say.

118
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
What are you doing?

119
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
You called and said you had troublefinding a Santa costume...

120
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
...so I borrowed onefrom a guy at work.

121
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

122
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
- Why?- Because...

123
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
...I'm finally getting him excitedabout Hanukkah.

124
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
And you're wrecking it.

125
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
But I didn't get to shake my bellylike a bowl full of jelly.

126
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
I'm sorry, Chandler,but this is really important to me.

127
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
Okay, fine. I'll give the suit back.

128
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
Hey, you think you can keep itanother night?

129
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Santa? Really?

130
00:07:39 --> 00:07:44
- Yeah, is that okay?- Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

131
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
- No.- Then it's okay!

132
00:07:50 --> 00:07:51
You know what, everybody?

133
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
Go home.You should be with your families.

134
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
It's bad enough we're workingNew Year's Eve.

135
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
Did I not tell anyoneabout New Year's Eve?

136
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
All right, look, go. Go home, okay?Merry Christmas.

137
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
- Merry Christmas.- Peace on earth.

138
00:08:05 --> 00:08:09
- Bye.- Good. Godspeed, good people.

139
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
- You're not gonna go?- No. I couldn't leave you alone.

140
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
Thanks.

141
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
Besides, I can't leave until thatChristmas party downstairs clears out.

142
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
There are some pissed-offinsurance people looking for that ham.

143
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
- Chandler Bing.- Hi, honey. We're all here.

144
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
We want to wish youa merry Christmas.

145
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
- Merry Christmas!- Merry Christmas!

146
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
Merry Christmas. I miss you guys.

147
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
So is it horrible?Is everybody working really hard?

148
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
Well, no, it's just me and Wendy.

149
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
Wendy? That sounds like a girl's name.

150
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
It is. Did I not tell you about her?

151
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
About the time you told meabout New Year's Eve.

152
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
- Where's everybody else?- "I sent them home."

153
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
You are such a good boss.Is she pretty?

154
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
Answer faster. Answer faster.

155
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
- I don't know.- Answer better. Answer better.

156
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
I don't think of her that way.I mean, she's a colleague.

157
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
- What does she do there?- She's regional vice president.

158
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
- She's just below me.- She did what?

159
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
Below me.

160
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
Wait, is Wendy the runner-upMiss Oklahoma?

161
00:09:16 --> 00:09:17
What?!

162
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
Well, she didn't win.

163
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
All right, maybe I should let you...

164
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
...and the second prettiest girlin Oklahoma get back to work.

165
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
Second prettiest that year. Of allthe girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...

166
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
Chandler, stop talking.

167
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
Honey, there's reallynothing to worry about.

168
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
- Okay.- I'm serious.

169
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
Okay.

170
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
- Merry Christmas.- Merry Christmas.

171
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
- Merry Christmas, you guys.- Merry Christmas.

172
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
- The wife says hi.- Fun conversation?

173
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
Well, she's just gotthis weird idea that...

174
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
...because you and I are alonesomething's gonna happen.

175
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
Really?

176
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
Would that be so terrible?

177
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
This is probably the wrong thingto be worrying about...

178
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
...but you're getting hamon my only tie.

179
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
- Back off, missy!- Missy?

180
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
I don't know. I'm not used to girlsmaking passes at me.

181
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
Wait a minute.Am I sexy in Oklahoma?

182
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
- You are to me.- No. No. No!

183
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
- Look, I'm married.- So? I'm married.

184
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
I'm happily married.

185
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
What's that like?

186
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
- Right. So I'm sorry, but...- Seriously? Happily married?

187
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
So that phone call before,that was happy?

188
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
Well, look, it's not easyto spend this much time apart.

189
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
She's entitled to bea little paranoid.

190
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
Or, in this case, right on the money.

191
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
You know, she's amazingand beautiful and smart.

192
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
And if she were here right now,she'd kick your ass.

193
00:10:55 --> 00:11:00
Look, you're a really nice person,ham-stealing and adultery aside.

194
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
But what I have with my wifeis pretty great.

195
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
So nothing's ever gonna happenbetween us.

196
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
Okay, let me ask you something.

197
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
If what you and your wife haveis so great...

198
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
...then why are you spendingChristmas with me?

199
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
You were the most beautiful womanin the room tonight.

200
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
- Really?- Are you kidding?

201
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22
You're the most beautiful womanin most rooms.

202
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
What's going on?You and I just made out.

203
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
- You and I are making out?- Well, not anymore.

204
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
- But we don't do that.- I know. I just thought it would be fun.

205
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
- How drunk are you?- Drunk enough that I wanna do this.

206
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
Not so drunk that you shouldfeel guilty about taking advantage.

207
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
That's a perfect amount.

208
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
- You know what's weird?- What?

209
00:11:52 --> 00:11:53
- This doesn't feel weird.- I know.

210
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
- You're a really good kisser.- Well, I have kissed over four women.

211
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
You wanna get under the covers?Okay.

212
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
Wow, you are really fast.

213
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
It bodes well for methat speed impresses you.

214
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
- We're gonna see each other naked.- Yep.

215
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19

216
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
- One.- Two.

217
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
Three.

218
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
Well, I think it's safe to saythat our friendship is effectively ruined.

219
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
We weren't that close anyway.

220
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
Are you really gonna go outwith that nurse-man?

221
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Well, you and Iare just goofing around.

222
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
I thought, why notjust goof around with him?

223
00:12:41 --> 00:12:45
I don't know if you've ever looked up"goofing around" in the dictionary.

224
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
Well, I have.

225
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
And the technical definitionis two friends...

226
00:12:51 --> 00:12:56
...who care a lot about each otherand have amazing sex...

227
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
...and just want to spendmore time together.

228
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
If you have this newfangled dictionarythat gets you mad at me...

229
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
...then we have to, you know,get you my original dictionary.

230
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
I am so bad at this.

231
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
I think you're betterthan you think you are.

232
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
- Really? Okay. So if...?- Know when to stop.

233
00:13:17 --> 00:13:18
I sensed that I should stop.

234
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
- So we're okay?- Yeah.

235
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
- Don't do the dance.- Right.

236
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
I can't get married withoutsomething old, something new...

237
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
...something borrowed, something blue.- Okay, okay.

238
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
Here's something blue and new.

239
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
You are so efficient. I love you.

240
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
- Let's go.- No, no, wait!

241
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
We need something old.

242
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
Okay. I have a condom in my walletthat I've had since I was 12.

243
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
That'll work!

244
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
I don't think so.

245
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
Okay. Now we just needsomething borrowed.

246
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
- Here, just take this.- That's stealing.

247
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
We'll bring it back.Just put it under your dress.

248
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
Okay, one thing at a time.

249
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
Listen...

250
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
...I've been thinking.

251
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
It's not fair for me to ask you to spendall of your money on our wedding.

252
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
I mean, you work...You work really hard for that.

253
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
- Well...- Well, you work for that.

254
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
Look, I've thought about it too.And...

255
00:14:23 --> 00:14:27
...I'm sorry. I think we should spendall of the money on the wedding.

256
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
- You do?- Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.

257
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
Yeah, look, when I proposed...

258
00:14:34 --> 00:14:38
...I told you that I would do anythingto make you happy.

259
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
And if having the perfect weddingmakes you happy, then...

260
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
Then that's what we're gonna do.

261
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
You are so sweet.

262
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
But wait. What about our...?What about the future and stuff?

263
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
Forget about the future and stuff.So we only have two kids.

264
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
You know, we'll pick our favorite,and that one will get to go to college.

265
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
- You've thought about that?- Yeah.

266
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
- How many kids were we gonna have?- Four. A boy, twin girls...

267
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
...and another boy.

00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
- What else did you think about?- Well...

269
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
...stuff like where we'd live, you know.

270
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
Like a small place outside the citywhere our kids could ride bikes and stuff.

271
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
And we could have a catthat had a bell on its collar...

272
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
...and we could hear it every timeit ran through the little kitty door.

273
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
We'd have an apartment over the garagewhere Joey could grow old.

274
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
You know what?

275
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
I don't...I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

276
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
- Sure you do.- No.

277
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
I want everythingthat you've just said.

278
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
I want a marriage.

279

00:16:25 --> 00:16:29

- I never want to leave you again.- I thought if you left, you'd get fired.

296
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
Turns out they can't fire me.Because I quit.

297
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
- What?- What? You...? You really quit your job?

298
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
Yeah. It was a stupid job,and I could not stand leaving you.

299
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
