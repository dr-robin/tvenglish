Taste it.

Yeah, it's fat.

29

I drank fat!

30

I know, I did that two minutes ago.

00:00:24.22,00:00:25.62

35

Hey, Mr. Tux.

38

-Why aren't you dressed?[br]-We have a half-hour.

39

00:00:28.58,00:00:31.57

41

That was four minutes ago.[br]We have to be out the door at 7:40.

42



43

00:00:31.82,00:00:35.18

44

Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us[br]two minutes to get dressed.

45



46

00:00:35.42,00:00:37.49

47

I'd feel better if you[br]got dressed now.

48



49

00:00:37.98,00:00:39.33

50

-Okay.[br]-Okay.

Oh, look at you. All sexy.

54

00:00:45.22,00:00:46.10

56

Really?

57



58

00:00:51.22,00:00:55.90

59

-How come you didn't come over earlier?[br]-Because I' m a stupid, stupid man.

62

Hey, Ross, want some cider?

65

No.

66



67

00:01:01.62,00:01:03.29

68

So you' re pretty close, huh?

69



70

00:01:03.50,00:01:05.25

71

Makeup's on. Hair's done.

72



73

00:01:05.50,00:01:06.82

74

I just have to get dressed.

75



76

00:01:07.06,00:01:09.73

77

And that takes, what?[br]Just 6 or 7 minutes?

78



79

00:01:09.98,00:01:12.25

80

Yeah. Once I figure out[br]what I' m wearing.

00:02:04.42,00:02:07.17

92

What's the matter?[br]You nervous about your speech?

93



94

00:02:07.42,00:02:08.74

95

Nope.

96



97

00:02:10.22,00:02:12.05

98

-You wanna hear it?[br]-Am I in it?

99



100

00:02:16.82,00:02:19.57

101

After I thank everyone[br]for donating to the museum. . .

102



103

00:02:19.82,00:02:22.46

104

. . .I sing a song about the wonder[br]that is Joey.

105



106

00:02:26.42,00:02:27.93

107

Hello! You look great!

108



109

00:02:28.18,00:02:30.25

110

Thank you. I know, though.

111



112

00:02:31.78,00:02:35.45

113

You see this? This is a person[br]who is ready to go.

114



115

00:02:35.70,00:02:36.81

116

Phoebe, you. . . .

117



118

00:02:37.30,00:02:38.37

119

You are my star.

120



121

00:02:39.42,00:02:41.57

122

Well, you' re my lucky penny.

123



124

00:02:44.42,00:02:49.33

125

All right, I took the quiz. And it[br]turns out I do put career before men.

126



127

00:02:52.02,00:02:52.90

128

Get up.

129



130

00:02:53.38,00:02:54.18

131

What?

132



133

00:02:54.78,00:02:57.21

134

-You' re in my seat.[br]-How is this your seat?

135



136

00:03:00.54,00:03:01.73

137

I was sitting there.

138



139

00:03:01.94,00:03:03.34

140

But then you left.

141



142

00:03:03.90,00:03:06.33

143

Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

144



145

00:03:07.14,00:03:09.37

146

I went to the bathroom.[br]You knew I'd be back.

147



148

00:03:09.62,00:03:11.34

149

What's the big deal?[br]Sit somewhere else!

150



151

00:03:11.54,00:03:14.93

152

The "big deal" is I was sitting[br]there last! So. . .

153



154

00:03:15.18,00:03:16.41

155

. . .it's my seat.

156



157

00:03:16.94,00:03:20.93

158

Well, actually, the last place[br]you were sitting was in there, so. . . .

159



160

00:03:21.42,00:03:23.85

161

You guys, you know what?[br]It doesn't matter.

162



163

00:03:24.10,00:03:28.46

164

You both have to go get dressed before[br]the big vein in my head pops.

165



166

00:03:28.70,00:03:31.37

167

I just have to do one thing.[br]It's not a big deal.

168



169

00:03:31.62,00:03:32.69

170

Get up!

171



172

00:03:35.62,00:03:37.77

173

Phoebe, you look great!

174



175

00:03:38.38,00:03:40.13

176

All right already.

177



178

00:03:41.02,00:03:42.82

179

Are you gonna do magic?

180



181

00:03:45.22,00:03:46.94

182

That's funny. Change.

183



184

00:03:47.14,00:03:48.97

185

-Hang on, I just got in.[br]-I don't care.

186



187

00:03:49.22,00:03:50.94

188

It starts at 8.[br]We can't be late.

189



190

00:03:51.18,00:03:53.93

191

"He could not, would not,[br]want to wait. "

192



193

00:03:54.62,00:03:57.26

194

Our table is down in front.[br]My boss will be there.

195



196

00:03:57.50,00:03:59.77

197

Everyone will see if we arrive[br]after it starts.

198



199

00:04:00.02,00:04:01.90

200

Has somebody been drinking my fat?

201



202

00:04:03.42,00:04:07.01

203

Does this look like something a[br]paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?

204



205

00:04:07.26,00:04:09.73

206

I don't know.[br]You might be the first one.

207



208

00:04:10.98,00:04:13.10

209

-Rach, did you check the machine?[br]-No.

210



211

00:04:13.50,00:04:17.25

212

Wait. This is the outfit that makes[br]my calves look fat. Never mind.

213



214

00:04:20.98,00:04:23.73

215

Well, Joey, I wrote[br]a little song today.

216



217

00:04:24.18,00:04:25.41

218

It's called, "Get up! "

219



220

00:04:26.62,00:04:29.18

221

All right. You can have the chair.

222



223

00:04:29.38,00:04:32.53

224

-Really?[br]-Oh, my. Would you look at that?

225



226

00:04:36.42,00:04:37.85

227

It's me, I'm coming over.

228



229

00:04:38.10,00:04:40.57

230

What if I'm already there[br]when you play this message?

231



232

00:04:40.82,00:04:42.62

233

Is that too spooky?

234



235

00:04:44.58,00:04:46.97

236

Hi, Rach, are you there?[br]It's me. Pick up.

237



238

00:04:47.42,00:04:49.14

239

Rachel? Rach?

240



241

00:04:49.62,00:04:50.77

242

What?

243



244

00:04:52.22,00:04:53.10

245

Never mind.

246



247

00:04:55.50,00:04:57.89

248

Monica, it's Richard. Call me.

249



250

00:05:01.42,00:05:02.90

251

Is that message old or new?

252



253

00:05:04.34,00:05:05.85

254

Old or new? Old or new?

255



256

00:05:06.10,00:05:08.82

257

It's definitely old.[br]Didn't you hear the double beep?

258



259

00:05:09.06,00:05:11.33

260

What if it's new?[br]We agreed not to talk.

261



262

00:05:11.54,00:05:14.21

263

It could be important.[br]Shouldn't I call him back?

264



265

00:05:14.46,00:05:16.73

266

Honey, you did call him back.[br]It's old.

267



268

00:05:16.94,00:05:18.93

269

Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.

270



271

00:05:19.14,00:05:21.18

272

When Carol and I broke up. . .

273



274

00:05:21.42,00:05:24.33

275

. . .I went through the same thing.[br]You know what I did?

276



277

00:05:24.54,00:05:26.45

278

I got dressed.

279



280

00:05:28.94,00:05:31.74

281

Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?

282



283

00:05:31.94,00:05:33.90

284

There we go. There we go.

285



286

00:05:34.62,00:05:36.97

287

You know what? Don't get up.[br]Just sit there.

288



289

00:05:37.22,00:05:40.13

290

I just hope you don't mind[br]my hand right here.

291



292

00:05:41.38,00:05:44.58

293

Not touching. Can't get mad![br]Not touching. Can't get mad!

294



295

00:05:44.82,00:05:46.86

296

Not touching. Can't get mad!

297



298

00:05:47.78,00:05:49.37

299

Oh, my God!

300



301

00:05:49.82,00:05:51.17

302

You rotten boys!

303



304

00:05:52.30,00:05:54.45

305

-Sorry, Phoebe.[br]-What am I gonna do?

306



307

00:05:54.70,00:05:56.45

308

Don't rub it![br]What gets out hummus?

309



310

00:05:56.70,00:05:58.29

311

What gets out hummus?

312



313

00:05:58.78,00:06:00.74

314

Monica![br]What gets out hummus?

315



316

00:06:01.74,00:06:04.94

317

If it is a new message,[br]what is he calling to say?

318



319

00:06:05.74,00:06:07.89

320

Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

321



322

00:06:09.42,00:06:11.54

323

Maybe he called to say[br]you' re obsessive and crazy?

324



325

00:06:11.78,00:06:13.90

326

-So should I call him back?[br]-No!

327



328

00:06:15.22,00:06:16.21

329

No!

330



331

00:06:18.22,00:06:21.13

332

-Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.[br]-Fine with me.

333



334

00:06:24.82,00:06:27.09

335

I am so comfortable.

336



337

00:06:28.30,00:06:29.21

338

Me too.

339



340

00:06:29.58,00:06:32.97

341

In fact, I think I might be[br]a little too comfortable.

342



343

00:06:36.98,00:06:40.37

344

Okay, we have 1 9 minutes.[br]I want you to go and change.

345



346

00:06:40.62,00:06:44.66

347

When you come back, Joey will go change[br]and he'll have vacated the chair.

348



349

00:06:45.02,00:06:46.05

350

-Okay.[br]-All right.

351



352

00:06:46.30,00:06:47.78

353

Fine. I' m going.

354



355

00:06:48.02,00:06:51.41

356

When I get back, it's Chair City.[br]And I' m the guy. . .

357



358

00:06:51.62,00:06:53.29

359

. . .who's sitting in a chair!

360



361

00:06:55.30,00:06:56.57

362

Is this a little too--

363



364

00:06:56.82,00:06:58.73

365

Pheebs? What happened?

366



367

00:06:58.94,00:07:00.17

368

I got the hummus.

369



370

00:07:00.42,00:07:04.21

371

Oh, honey, we'll find you something.[br]You wanna wear my black jacket?

372



373

00:07:04.42,00:07:06.54

374

-It won't go with this dress.[br]-You' re right.

375



376

00:07:06.78,00:07:10.98

377

-Well, let's just get you out of that.[br]-No, no, no. Not "out of that. "

378



379

00:07:11.18,00:07:14.30

380

-Not "out" of clothes.[br]-Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

381



382

00:07:14.50,00:07:15.73

383

I called him.

384



385

00:07:16.54,00:07:19.53

386

Yes. I got his machine[br]and I left a message.

387



388

00:07:19.78,00:07:21.18

389

But it's okay. It's okay. . .

390



391

00:07:21.42,00:07:24.46

392

. . .because it was, like,[br]a casual, breezy message.

393



394

00:07:24.70,00:07:25.69

395

It was breezy.

396



397

00:07:26.58,00:07:28.38

398

Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy?

399



400

00:07:28.58,00:07:32.78

401

How could it not be breezy? No.[br]Because you' re in such a breezy place.

402



403

00:07:33.50,00:07:37.54

404

I got it. I'll play my message and[br]you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.

405



406

00:07:37.74,00:07:39.73

407

But how you gonna do that?

408



409

00:07:40.34,00:07:42.73

410

I know the code[br]to his answering machine.

411



412

00:07:42.94,00:07:45.37

413

Okay, Mon, I really don't think[br]this is the--

414



415

00:07:45.62,00:07:48.21

416

Okay, you' re dialing.[br]You are dialing.

417



418

00:07:57.98,00:08:01.26

419

Hi, this is Richard.[br]Please leave a message at the tone.

420



421

00:08:02.82,00:08:04.46

422

You have two new messages.

423



424

00:08:04.90,00:08:06.25

425

What a cool job.

426



427

00:08:06.50,00:08:08.38

428

"You have two new messages. "

429



430

00:08:10.18,00:08:12.37

431

Please pass the pie.

432



433

00:08:14.62,00:08:17.13

434

Hi, it's Monica.[br]I'm just checking in.

435



436

00:08:17.34,00:08:20.46

437

I got a message and didn't know[br]if it was old or new.

438



439

00:08:20.70,00:08:22.61

440

So I'm just checking.

441



442

00:08:22.82,00:08:24.38

443

So let me know.

444



445

00:08:24.62,00:08:25.94

446

Or don't. Whatever.

447



448

00:08:26.18,00:08:27.66

449

I'm breezy!

450



451

00:08:29.02,00:08:32.33

452

You can't say you' re "breezy. "[br]That negates the "breezy. "

453



454

00:08:34.50,00:08:37.33

455

Hola. It's me.[br]Yesterday was really fun.

456



457

00:08:38.02,00:08:40.17

458

Call me about this weekend, okay?

459



460

00:08:43.34,00:08:44.90

461

Now, she sounded breezy.

462



463

00:08:48.74,00:08:52.25

464

He's seeing someone.[br]I can't believe he's seeing someone.

465



466

00:08:52.50,00:08:54.93

467

-You don't know that.[br]-Well, whose voice was that?

468



469

00:08:55.14,00:08:58.02

470

Maybe it was his sister's.[br]Maybe it was his daughter's.

471



472

00:08:59.34,00:09:02.49

473

Michelle. Of course![br]Did it sound like Michelle?

474



475

00:09:03.10,00:09:06.93

476

Oh, great. It's starting to rain.[br]That'll make it easier to get a cab.

477



478

00:09:07.90,00:09:08.85

479

It was Michelle.

480



481

00:09:09.10,00:09:10.74

482

It was definitely Michelle.

483



484

00:09:10.98,00:09:14.97

485

Try Monica's green dress. If it[br]doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.

486



487

00:09:15.22,00:09:17.65

488

-Unless I wear it.[br]-You don't know what you' re wearing?

489



490

00:09:17.90,00:09:20.37

491

I' m just trying to look nice[br]for your big night.

492



493

00:09:20.62,00:09:23.18

494

Yeah, which we have to leave for[br]in 1 2 minutes.

495



496

00:09:23.42,00:09:26.06

497

Come on, I'll just pick[br]something out for you.

498



499

00:09:26.30,00:09:28.45

500

You'll notice that I' m fully dressed.

501



502

00:09:28.70,00:09:31.93

503

I, in turn, have noticed[br]that you are not.

504



505

00:09:32.18,00:09:36.78

506

So in the words of A.A. Milne,[br]"Get out of my chair, dill-hole. "

507



508

00:09:39.14,00:09:40.46

509

Okay.

510



511

00:09:47.82,00:09:50.33

512

-What are you doing?[br]-You said to give you the chair.

513



514

00:09:50.58,00:09:52.54

515

You didn't say anything about cushions.

516



517

00:09:52.74,00:09:54.38

518

They' re the essence[br]of the chair!

519



520

00:09:54.62,00:09:57.13

521

That's right! I' m taking the essence.

522



523

00:09:58.18,00:09:59.93

524

Oh, he'll be back.

525



526

00:10:00.14,00:10:02.45

527

Oh, there's nobody in the room.

528



529

00:10:03.10,00:10:06.57

530

-I' m sorry, I thought it looked pretty.[br]-That was a Halloween costume.

531



532

00:10:06.82,00:10:09.97

533

Unless you would like me to go[br]as Little Bo Peep.

534



535

00:10:10.42,00:10:13.06

536

I didn't recognize it[br]without that inflatable sheep.

537



538

00:10:13.30,00:10:16.93

539

Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler,[br]I would like back one of these days.

540



541

00:10:19.46,00:10:21.97

542

Rach, good! Listen, isn't this[br]perfect for me?

543



544

00:10:22.22,00:10:24.45

545

Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

546



547

00:10:24.70,00:10:27.93

548

Of course, not for tonight.[br]Hi. I' m going to a benefit.

549



550

00:10:28.14,00:10:30.13

551

Not for tonight?[br]What are you doing?

552



553

00:10:30.38,00:10:33.58

554

No, I' m sorry. We didn't mean it.[br]I love you. Breathe.

555



556

00:10:34.90,00:10:37.78

557

We used them as pillows[br]when we went camping.

558



559

00:10:37.98,00:10:38.93

560

What?

561



562

00:10:39.90,00:10:41.05

563

The sheep.

564



565

00:10:42.42,00:10:45.09

566

Hey, what you do on your own time. . . .

567



568

00:10:48.62,00:10:50.34

569

Where's my underwear?

570



571

00:10:51.14,00:10:54.45

572

-Come on, you took his underwear?[br]-He took my essence!

573



574

00:10:54.70,00:10:59.33

575

Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear[br]the underwear you' re wearing now?

576



577

00:10:59.58,00:11:02.09

578

Because I' m not wearing[br]any underwear now.

579



580

00:11:03.22,00:11:05.53

581

Then why do you have[br]to wear underwear tonight?

582



583

00:11:05.78,00:11:07.45

584

It's a rented tux, okay?

585



586

00:11:07.70,00:11:10.85

587

I' m not gonna go commando[br]in another man's fatigues.

588



589

00:11:13.10,00:11:16.38

590

Then somebody's gonna have[br]to give somebody back his cushions.

591



592

00:11:17.18,00:11:21.17

593

Okay. You hide my clothes, I' m gonna[br]do the exact opposite to you.

594



595

00:11:23.42,00:11:26.41

596

What, are you gonna show me my clothes?

597



598

00:11:26.66,00:11:28.01

599

Hey, opposite. . .

600



601

00:11:28.98,00:11:30.13

602

. . .is opposite.

603



604

00:11:31.94,00:11:33.45

605

He's got nothing!

606



607

00:11:34.34,00:11:35.82

608

Okay, I' m ready.

609



610

00:11:40.90,00:11:43.94

611

Rachel didn't have anything I liked[br]but this ribbon.

612



613

00:11:44.14,00:11:46.45

614

I thought, all right,[br]I'll be political.

615



616

00:11:48.18,00:11:51.09

617

-What are you supporting?[br]-Christmas.

618



619

00:11:52.58,00:11:57.33

620

Hey, that's okay with me. Two down,[br]and I have exactly 1 2 minutes--

621



622

00:11:57.82,00:11:58.81

623

What?

624



625

00:11:59.82,00:12:02.25

626

My watch stopped.[br]My watch. Okay, see. . .

627



628

00:12:02.50,00:12:05.22

629

. . .the dinosaur tail[br]isn't going around anymore.

630



631

00:12:05.82,00:12:08.33

632

What time is it? It's 7:33.[br]I have 7 minutes.

633



634

00:12:08.54,00:12:09.65

635

I have seven minutes!

636



637

00:12:09.86,00:12:12.74

638

Which shoes should I wear?[br]The black or the purple?

639



640

00:12:13.02,00:12:15.33

641

-Just pick one, okay?[br]-Oh, okay, okay. The black.

642



643

00:12:15.54,00:12:17.73

644

Do you have black[br]with little strappies?

645



646

00:12:17.98,00:12:21.86

647

Yeah. But those go better with pants.[br]Maybe I should wear pants.

648



649

00:12:22.30,00:12:26.74

650

Yeah, pants! What an idea![br]Or better yet, go without pants.

651



652

00:12:26.98,00:12:29.94

653

I don't know what you' re doing,[br]but just get in there. . .

654



655

00:12:30.18,00:12:32.53

656

. . .and pick out any shoes[br]that fit your feet.

657



658

00:12:32.74,00:12:36.05

659

I don't care if they match.[br]I don't care if they make. . .

660



661

00:12:36.30,00:12:40.74

662

. . .your ankles or your knees or your[br]earlobes look fat. Just do it!

663



664

00:12:40.94,00:12:43.50

665

Go in there, pick something out[br]so we can go.

666



667

00:12:46.18,00:12:48.57

668

-All right.[br]-Thank you.

669



670

00:12:49.42,00:12:52.93

671

I've got to call Michelle to see[br]if that was her voice.

672



673

00:12:53.14,00:12:54.97

674

It was. It was her voice.

675



676

00:12:55.22,00:12:58.13

677

Monica, I think you've gone over[br]to the bad place.

678



679

00:13:02.02,00:13:03.74

680

Hola.

681



682

00:13:04.10,00:13:06.29

683

Hello? Hello?

684



685

00:13:07.62,00:13:10.58

686

-Okay. That was her, right?[br]-Definitely. Yeah.

687



688

00:13:10.82,00:13:12.33

689

So there you go.

690



691

00:13:12.74,00:13:15.94

692

We' re out of the woods.[br]I think I'll get dressed now.

693



694

00:13:17.42,00:13:19.09

695

-I'll get it.[br]-Okay.

696



697

00:13:20.34,00:13:21.74

698

Hi, Monica and Rachel's.

699



700

00:13:22.22,00:13:25.13

701

Yeah, just a second.[br]Can I ask who's calling?

702



703

00:13:25.42,00:13:26.65

704

It's Michelle!

705



706

00:13:28.78,00:13:32.53

707

She must have that "caller l.D. " thing.[br]You should get that.

708



709

00:13:35.42,00:13:36.45

710

Michelle?

711



712

00:13:36.90,00:13:40.73

713

Yeah, that was me.[br]I dialed your number by mistake.

714



715

00:13:40.98,00:13:42.05

716

Just try to be--

717



718

00:13:43.98,00:13:45.33

719

You' re so sweet.

720



721

00:13:46.02,00:13:47.98

722

Yeah, we were a great couple.

723



724

00:13:48.30,00:13:50.10

725

I know, I really miss him.

726



727

00:13:50.62,00:13:53.13

728

Well, you know how it is.[br]It's just that. . . .

729



730

00:13:53.34,00:13:54.93

731

You know what's weird?

732



733

00:13:56.82,00:13:58.81

734

Donald Duck never wore pants.

735



736

00:14:00.22,00:14:01.97

737

But when he gets[br]out of the shower. . .

738



739

00:14:02.22,00:14:04.69

740

. . .he always puts a towel[br]around his waist.

741



742

00:14:07.30,00:14:09.45

743

I mean, what is that about?

744



745

00:14:11.02,00:14:13.77

746

I only beeped in so I could[br]hear my own message.

747



748

00:14:14.02,00:14:15.25

749

I mean, that's allowed.

750



751

00:14:17.94,00:14:22.09

752

I would really appreciate it if you[br]wouldn't tell your dad about--

753



754

00:14:22.30,00:14:26.53

755

What do you mean, you don't feel[br]comfortable with this? We' re friends!

756



757

00:14:27.70,00:14:29.58

758

That bitch always hated me.

759



760

00:14:29.82,00:14:31.14

761

I' m calling her back.

762



763

00:14:33.30,00:14:34.97

764

-Okay, fine.[br]-Okay.

765



766

00:14:36.22,00:14:39.42

767

-She's got a phone in there, right?[br]-Okay, we' re on it.

768



769

00:14:50.02,00:14:53.53

770

I know it says "black tie optional" . . .

771



772

00:14:53.78,00:14:56.34

773

. . .but this may be pushing it a little.

774



775

00:14:56.74,00:14:58.30

776

I' m not gonna go.

777



778

00:15:00.38,00:15:01.57

779

You' re not gonna go?

780



781

00:15:01.82,00:15:05.33

782

No, I think I' m gonna catch up[br]on my correspondence.

783



784

00:15:06.74,00:15:09.49

785

How can you not be going?

786



787

00:15:10.22,00:15:11.45

788

I' m not gonna go.

789



790

00:15:11.70,00:15:15.25

791

So I think that will accomplish[br]the "not going. "

792



793

00:15:19.98,00:15:22.21

794

You know, just out of curiosity--

795



796

00:15:22.62,00:15:25.77

797

Ever since I was humiliated[br]and yelled at in front of my friends. . .

798



799

00:15:26.02,00:15:30.25

800

. . .I' m just, I don't know, not in a[br]very museum benefit-y kind of mood.

801



802

00:15:30.50,00:15:34.33

803

Right. Well, okay. Okay.[br]God, I' m sorry. I' m sorry I yelled.

804



805

00:15:34.54,00:15:36.66

806

-That's fine.[br]-No, but you' re mad.

807



808

00:15:36.90,00:15:38.73

809

I' m not mad. I' m just not going.

810



811

00:15:38.94,00:15:40.37

812

-Right.[br]-Okay.

813



814

00:15:41.62,00:15:44.58

815

You know that I have to go, right?

816



817

00:15:44.82,00:15:49.13

818

So is it gonna be, like,[br]I' m abandoning you while you' re upset?

819



820

00:15:49.34,00:15:50.17

821

-No.[br]-No?

822



823

00:15:50.42,00:15:54.33

824

-You' re not upset about the yelling.[br]-Right. And the humiliating.

825



826

00:15:54.54,00:15:56.53

827

Well, of course, the humiliating.

828



829

00:15:58.54,00:15:59.53

830

So we. . .

831



832

00:16:00.10,00:16:01.17

833

. . .we' re okay?

834



835

00:16:01.42,00:16:03.33

836

-We' re good.[br]-Right.

837



838

00:16:06.58,00:16:08.73

839

-Honey? I love you.[br]-Yes, Ross.

840



841

00:16:10.14,00:16:11.81

842

Get away from that phone!

843



844

00:16:14.42,00:16:16.33

845

She's just getting dressed now.

846



847

00:16:19.38,00:16:22.53

848

Is it wrong that I was[br]totally aroused by that?

849



850

00:16:30.10,00:16:32.53

851

Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

852



853

00:16:32.94,00:16:36.61

854

You hide my clothes,[br]I' m wearing everything you own.

855



856

00:16:37.14,00:16:38.65

857

Oh, my God!

858



859

00:16:40.22,00:16:43.77

860

That is so not the opposite[br]of taking somebody's underwear!

861



862

00:16:44.02,00:16:45.53

863

Look at me! I' m Chandler.

864



865

00:16:45.74,00:16:48.54

866

Could I be wearing any more clothes?

867



868

00:16:50.10,00:16:52.29

869

Maybe if I wasn't going commando. . . .

870



871

00:16:57.22,00:16:59.37

872

It's hot with all this stuff on.

873



874

00:16:59.62,00:17:02.09

875

I better not do any,[br]I don't know, lunges.

876



877

00:17:04.70,00:17:06.97

878

Okay, enough.[br]Enough with the lunging.

879



880

00:17:07.22,00:17:09.73

881

I' m sick of this.[br]I've had it up to here.

882



883

00:17:09.94,00:17:12.33

884

Neither of you can come to the party!

885



886

00:17:12.82,00:17:14.25

887

Jeez, what a baby!

888



889

00:17:15.30,00:17:17.81

890

Way to ruin it.[br]I was just gonna go get dressed.

891



892

00:17:18.06,00:17:20.37

893

The only person[br]I cared about getting dressed. . .

894



895

00:17:20.62,00:17:22.93

896

. . .is the person who's[br]not even gonna go.

897



898

00:17:23.18,00:17:24.98

899

Look, Rach, I' m sorry, okay?

900



901

00:17:25.22,00:17:29.13

902

Look, I was a jerk, okay?[br]I' m sorry I yelled. I want you there.

903



904

00:17:29.38,00:17:30.57

905

I need you there.

906



907

00:17:32.22,00:17:35.97

908

What can I do to show you[br]how much I want you to be there?

909



910

00:17:37.14,00:17:38.94

911

You could drink the fat.

912



913

00:17:41.42,00:17:43.93

914

Welcome to an adult conversation.

915



916

00:17:44.34,00:17:46.53

917

No, no, no.[br]Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

918



919

00:17:46.78,00:17:50.29

920

-That actually sounds interesting.[br]-What?

921



922

00:17:50.58,00:17:52.62

923

I think you should drink the fat.

924



925

00:17:58.74,00:18:02.57

926

Okay, if that's what it takes to[br]show you how much you mean to me. . .

927



928

00:18:02.82,00:18:05.38

929

. . .and how much I want you there,[br]that's what I'll do.

930



931

00:18:05.58,00:18:08.33

932

Let me get you another glass.[br]That's been sitting out.

933



934

00:18:09.02,00:18:10.93

935

I think this will be fine.

936



937

00:18:12.18,00:18:14.98

938

Okay, vanilla milkshake.[br]Just a vanilla milkshake. . .

939



940

00:18:15.22,00:18:17.94

941

. . .with chicken bits floating in it.

942



943

00:18:21.02,00:18:22.21

944

Cheers.

945



946

00:18:22.42,00:18:24.98

947

No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go.[br]I'll go.

948



949

00:18:25.22,00:18:26.29

950

You will?

951



952

00:18:27.18,00:18:29.06

953

You were really gonna do that.

954



955

00:18:29.26,00:18:30.06

956

Well, yeah.

957



958

00:18:31.10,00:18:33.17

959

You were gonna drink the fat.

960



961

00:18:36.62,00:18:38.53

962

Let's see what else he'll do!

963



964

00:18:40.30,00:18:43.02

965

How about you get changed?[br]Give him his underwear.

966



967

00:18:43.22,00:18:46.37

968

I'll get a cab. I want everyone[br]downstairs in two minutes.

969



970

00:18:46.58,00:18:47.65

971

Monica!

972



973

00:18:48.30,00:18:49.13

974

Stop it.

975



976

00:18:49.34,00:18:50.49

977

Stop it!

978



979

00:18:54.78,00:18:56.37

980

Ross went to get a cab, so we--

981



982

00:18:56.62,00:18:59.13

983

What are you doing? No, Monica, no!

984



985

00:19:02.30,00:19:03.70

986

Hi, this is Richard.

987



988

00:19:05.50,00:19:07.93

989

You have three new messages.

990



991

00:19:08.94,00:19:10.42

992

Not anymore.

993



994

00:19:11.14,00:19:12.57

995

Message erased.

996



997

00:19:14.70,00:19:18.85

998

To record your message,[br]begin speaking at the tone.

999



1000

00:19:19.94,00:19:21.85

1001

Hi, Richard. It's Monica.

1002



1003

00:19:22.10,00:19:24.93

1004

Listen, I did something[br]kind of crazy tonight.

1005



1006

00:19:25.14,00:19:27.94

1007

Maybe I' m getting my period[br]or something. I don't know.

1008



1009

00:19:28.58,00:19:32.05

1010

Anyway, I beeped into your machine[br]and I heard this message. . .

1011



1012

00:19:32.30,00:19:33.70

1013

. . .that freaked me out. . .

1014



1015

00:19:34.30,00:19:36.86

1016

. . .and Michelle will tell you the rest.

1017



1018

00:19:37.10,00:19:41.62

1019

I' m sorry, okay? And I hope that we[br]can just forget the whole thing.

1020



1021

00:19:44.34,00:19:47.85

1022

Your outgoing message[br]has now been changed.

1023



1024

00:19:48.98,00:19:49.86

1025

Outgoing?

1026



1027

00:19:50.10,00:19:51.33

1028

Did that say outgoing?

1029



1030

00:19:51.54,00:19:52.86

1031

Not outgoing!

1032



1033

00:19:55.94,00:19:57.77

1034

Hi, Richard, it's Monica.

1035



1036

00:19:58.02,00:20:00.82

1037

Listen, I did something[br]kind of crazy tonight.

1038



1039

00:20:01.02,00:20:03.61

1040

Maybe I'm getting my period[br]or something. I don't know.

1041



1042

00:20:03.82,00:20:06.17

1043

-How did you do that?[br]-I don't know!

1044



1045

00:20:06.42,00:20:08.41

1046

Goodbye.

1047



1048

00:20:11.22,00:20:15.34

1049

Okay, I've got two cabs[br]and no people! Go, go, go!

1050



1051

00:20:15.54,00:20:18.66

1052

Maybe we can call the phone company[br]to change the message?

1053



1054

00:20:18.90,00:20:20.13

1055

They could change his number.

1056



1057

00:20:20.34,00:20:23.33

1058

I think after this,[br]he'll be doing that himself.

1059



1060

00:20:25.22,00:20:26.02

1061

Rachel!

1062



1063

00:20:31.82,00:20:34.33

1064

You. . . .[br]You look. . . .

1065



1066

00:20:36.74,00:20:39.73

1067

And I still have about[br]five seconds to spare.

1068



1069

00:20:45.62,00:20:47.18

1070

That was about 7 seconds.

1071



1072

00:20:47.38,00:20:48.94

1073

So we' re a little late.

1074



1075

00:20:49.14,00:20:50.86

1076

Come on.

1077



1078

00:20:51.82,00:20:53.57

1079

Oh, and by the way. . . .

1080



1081

00:20:53.82,00:20:54.62

1082

What?

1083



1084

00:20:55.18,00:20:57.14

1085

I' m going commando too.

1086



1087

00:21:07.82,00:21:08.85

1088

Dr. Geller?

1089



1090

00:21:09.14,00:21:12.50

1091

-Sherman Whitfield, London lnstitute.[br]-What a pleasure.

1092



1093

00:21:12.90,00:21:17.37

1094

I was quite impressed with your[br]paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.

1095



1096

00:21:17.62,00:21:19.77

1097

Yes. It confirmed everything[br]I'd written.

1098



1099

00:21:20.02,00:21:21.34

1100

Excuse me.

1101



1102

00:21:21.58,00:21:22.53

1103

Hi.

1104



1105

00:21:23.10,00:21:23.93

1106

Yes?

1107



1108

00:21:24.38,00:21:26.10

1109

You' re kind of sitting in my seat.

1110



1111

00:21:27.42,00:21:28.98

1112

What do you mean, your seat?

1113



1114

00:21:29.54,00:21:32.34

1115

-I mean, I was sitting there.[br]-But you got up.

1116



1117

00:21:32.54,00:21:34.58

1118

But I never left the room.

1119



1120

00:21:35.30,00:21:37.53

1121

But you left the chair area.

1122



1123

00:21:39.02,00:21:41.74

1124

All right, that's it.[br]Give me your underwear.

1125
