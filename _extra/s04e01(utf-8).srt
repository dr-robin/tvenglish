1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:03
Phoebe found out about this lady...

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
...who knew her parents,and I don't know what happened.

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
I'm your mother.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
wouldn't date Chandler.

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
happened there either.

6
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Ross' new girlfriend shows up.

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
Then they kiss.

8
00:00:19 --> 00:00:22
Rachel or the bald girl.

9
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
I don't know whathappened there either.

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
Hold on.Let me go get Chandler.

11
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
She's helping me.My head's sunburned.

12
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
- Thanks a million.- You're welcome a million.

13
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
I'll be in our room.

14
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
Oh, my God!

15
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
I know.

16
00:01:04 --> 00:01:07
I got to go.

17
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
I got to go break up with Bonnie.

18
00:01:10 --> 00:01:11
Here? Now?

19
00:01:11 --> 00:01:12
I can't stay here all night.

20
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
If I go in there, she'll want to...

21
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
...do stuff.

22
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
Can't you sayyou aren't in the mood?

23
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
No, she likes that.

24
00:01:22 --> 00:01:24
Faking sleep doesn't work.

25
00:01:24 --> 00:01:27
I've woken up many times with her...

26
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
- Why am I telling you?- I don't know.

27
00:01:38 --> 00:01:42
- Not every morning...- Making it worse!

28
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
The One with the Jellyfish

29
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
You probably want to knowhow it happened.

30
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
I think I can figure it out.

31
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
I was born, and theneveryone lied their asses off.

32
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
No, it wasn't like that.

33
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
Remember how I saidLilly, Frank and I were close?

34
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
We were very close.

35
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
How close?

36
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
The three of us werekind of a couple.

37
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
I don't know how that would work.

38
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
I'm not asking!

39
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...

40
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
...and I was...

41
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
...scared.I was stupid and selfish...

42
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
I was 18 years old.Remember what it was like to be 18?

43
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
Mom killed herselfand my dad ran off.

44
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
I lived in a Gremlin with a guywho talked to his hand.

45
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
I'm sorry. I thought I'd left youwith the best parents.

46
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
I didn't hear about themtill a few years ago.

47
00:03:11 --> 00:03:12
By then, you were already grown-up.

48
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
You're here and I wouldreally like to get to know you.

49
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
Well, everybody does.

50
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
I'm a really cool person.

51
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
You had 29 years to find out,but you didn't even try.

52
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
You walked out on me,and I'll do the same.

53
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
I don't ever want to see you again.

54
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
Where's my purse?

55
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
Shoot! We're out of soda.

56
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
- I'll get you some.- Really?

57
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
No, because I'm not your boyfriend.

58
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?

59
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
My mom's friend, Phoebe,is actually my birth mom.

60
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
I found a dried-up seahorse.

61
00:03:56 --> 00:03:57
What do you mean?

62
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
My new mom,who's a big fat abandoner.

63
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
Don't you want to stay hereand talk about it?

64
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
I need to be alone.

65
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
It's over.

66
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
Was it awful?

67
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
It was long.

68
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
I didn't realize how late it was...

69
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
...till I saw the five o'clock shadowon her head.

70
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
She didn't want to stay.I called a cab. She just left.

71
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
I wrote you a letter.

72
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
Oh, thank you!

73
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
I like mail.

74
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
It's just some things I've beenthinking about. About us.

75
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
Before we even think about usgetting back together...

76
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
...I need to knowhow you feel about this stuff.

77
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
It's 5:30 in the morning.

78
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
So I'd better getcracking on this baby.

79
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
Come up when you're done.

80
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
I'll be up...

81
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
...in 18 pages.

82
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
Front and back.

83
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
Very exciting!

84
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
Why didn't you come up?

85
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
Done.

86
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
- You just finished?- I wanted to be thorough.

87
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
This is clearlyvery important to you. To us.

88
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
I wanted to readevery word carefully.

89
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
Twice.

90
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
Does it?

91
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
Sorry?

92
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
Does it?

93
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
I wanted to give that whole"Does it?" part another glance.

94
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
What do you mean?You said you read it twice.

95
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
It either does or doesn't.If you have to think...

96
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
No, I don't have to think about it.

97
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
In fact...

98
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
...I've decided.I have decided...

99
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
...that it...

100
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
...does.

101
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
Are you sure?

102
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Sure, I'm sure!

103
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
There's a nuclear holocaust.I'm the last man on earth.

104
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
Would you go out with me?

105
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
I've got canned goods.

106
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
Take a look at this!

107
00:07:24 --> 00:07:28
Check this baby out!Dug me a hole.

108
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
Excellent hole, Joe.

109
00:07:32 --> 00:07:33
Oh, no! My hole!

110
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
My foot!

111
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
What is it?

112
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Jellyfish sting!It hurts!

113
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Can we help you to the house?

114
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
It's two miles.

115
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
And I'm tired from digging.

116
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
Damn the jellyfish!

117
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
Damn all the jellyfish!

118
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
Do something.

119
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
There's only one thing.

120
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
What is it?

121
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
Pee on it.

122
00:07:56 --> 00:07:57
Gross!

123
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
I saw it on Discovery Channel.

124
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
He's right.There's ammonia in that...

125
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
...that kills the pain.

126
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
Forget it.It doesn't hurt that bad!

127
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
You can use my hole for privacy.

128
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
I'm ready to getthe hell out of here.

129
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
Are you...?

130
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
That's so great!

131
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
Not for Bonnie.

132
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
But for you, yea!

133
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
- How was the beach?- Nothing. I don't know.

134
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
- What happened?- Nothing.

135
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
- I'm going to shower.- Me too.

136
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
Me too.

137
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
I'll put this in the car.

138
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
I have to go pack!

139
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
- And it really does?- It does.

140
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
It really and truly does.

141
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
It so does not!

142
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
She wants me to take responsibilityfor everything that went wrong.

143
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
She goes on for five pagesabout how I was unfaithful to her.

144
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
We were on a break!

145
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
If you say that one more time,I'll break up with you.

146
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
This breakup was not all my fault.She says here...

147
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
..."If you accept full responsibility...

148
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
...I can begin to trust you again."

149
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
"Does that seem likesomething you can do? Does it?"

150
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
You have what you want.You're back with her.

151
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
If you bring this up now,you'll wreck it.

152
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
Yeah, I know.You're right.

153
00:09:49 --> 00:09:50
I'll let it go.

154
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
But you know how hard it isto forget this?

155
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
Sure, it's hard...

156
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
...but you don't have to talk about it.

157
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
A lot happened on that trip...

158
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
...that we shouldnever, ever talk about.

159
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
What happened on that beach?

160
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
It's between us and the sea, Ross.

161
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
Hi, Ursula.

162
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
I know that we haven't talkedin a long time.

163
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
Our mom is not our birth mom.This other lady is our birth mom.

164
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
Right, the one that lives in Montauk.

165
00:10:30 --> 00:10:30
You know her?

166
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
No. I read about herin Mom's suicide note.

167
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
There was a suicide note?Do you still have it?

168
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
Hang on.

169
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

170
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
Yeah, so how have you been doing?

171
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
Shut up!

172
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.I'll miss you."

173
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
"P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."

174
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
You just wrote this!

175
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
It's pretty much the gist.

176
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
Except for the poem.You read the poem, right?

177
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
All right. Hang on.

178
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
Pass the cheese, please.

179
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
You can't even look at me, can you?

180
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
It's Phoebe!We can talk to Phoebe!

181
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
I'm too depressed to talk.

182
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
I'll give you $1000 to talk.

183
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35
What about making thatbeach trip an annual thing?

184
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
What happened out there?

185
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
What? We took a walk.Nothing happened.

186
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
I came back with nothing all over me.

187
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
What happened?Joey?

188
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
All right.

189
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
We swore we'd never tell.

190
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
They'll never understand.

191
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
We have to get it out.It's eating me alive!

192
00:11:58 --> 00:12:02
- Monica got stung by a jellyfish.- All right!

193
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
I got stung.

194
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
Stung bad.

195
00:12:13 --> 00:12:14
I couldn't stand.

196
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
I couldn't walk.

197
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
We were two miles from the house.

198
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
We were scared and alone.

199
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
We didn't think we could make it.

200
00:12:27 --> 00:12:28
I was in pain.

201
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
And I was tired from digging.

202
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
Then Joey remembered something.

203
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
I'd seen it on Discovery Channel.

204
00:12:37 --> 00:12:38
Wait, I saw that.

205
00:12:38 --> 00:12:43
On the Discovery Channel.About jellyfish and how if you...

206
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
You peed on yourself?

207
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
You can't say that!You don't know!

208
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
I thought I would pass out.

209
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
I tried, but I couldn't...

210
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
...bend that way.

211
00:13:06 --> 00:13:09
That's right.I stepped up.

212
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
She's my friend and she needed help.

213
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
If I had to,I'd pee on any of you.

214
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
Only...

215
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
...I couldn't.

216
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
I got the stage fright.

217
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
I wanted to help,but there was too much pressure.

218
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
So I turned to Chandler.

219
00:13:34 --> 00:13:39
Joey kept screaming at me,"Do it now. Do it. Do it now!"

220
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
Sometimes, late at night,I can still hear the screaming.

221
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
Because I do it through my wallto freak you out.

222
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
And fuchsia and mauve

223
00:13:51 --> 00:13:56
Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom

224
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
I invite all of you to countthe colors in your bedroom.

225
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
Except for you.You go away.

226
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
I'll go in a second.

227
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
I just want to tell you...

228
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
...there wasn't a dayI didn't regret giving you up.

229
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
Okay, bye.

230
00:14:16 --> 00:14:17
I'm not done.

231
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
The reason I neverlooked you up was because...

232
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
...I was afraid you'd react...

233
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
...just like the wayyou're reacting now.

234
00:14:25 --> 00:14:29
Can't we just start from here?Please?

235
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
Sorry.

236
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
One last thing.

237
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
You came looking for family.

238
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
I'm family.

239
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
I'm it.

240
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
Now I'm done.

241
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
It's not like we're losing anything.

242
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
I guess you're right.

243
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
It's not like we know each otheror have anything in common.

244
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
I don't know.It's not like...

245
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
...we don't have anything in common.

246
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
I mean, I like pizza.

247
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
I like pizza!

248
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
Wait, I like the Beatles.

249
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
Oh, my God!So do I.

250
00:15:18 --> 00:15:19
Puppies.Cute or ugly?

251
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
So cute!

252
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
You see?

253
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
But I'm still mad at you.

254
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
I know.

255
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
I'm mad at me too.

256
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
Do you want to get something to eat?I'm kind of hungry.

257
00:15:34 --> 00:15:35
Hey! Me too!

258
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
Stop it. Now you're justdoing it to freak me out.

259
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
I missed you.

260
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
I missed you too.

261
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
I was so nervous about that letter.

262
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
But the way youowned up to everything...

263
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
...it just showed mehow much you've grown.

264
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
I suppose.

265
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
You have, Ross.You should give yourself credit.

266
00:16:06 --> 00:16:10
My mom never thoughtthis would work out.

267
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
She said, "Once a cheater,always a cheater."

268
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
I just wish we hadn'tlost those four months.

269
00:16:19 --> 00:16:24
But if time was what you neededto gain a little perspective...

270
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
We were on a break!

271
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
- Coffeehouse?- You bet.

272
00:16:29 --> 00:16:33
It took two peopleto break up this relationship.

273
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
You and that girl, which yesterdayyou took full responsibility for.

274
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
I didn't know whatI took responsibility for.

275
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
I didn't finish the letter.

276
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
I fell asleep.

277
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
You fell asleep?

278
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
It was 5:30 in the morning.

279
00:16:48 --> 00:16:53
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

280
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
Front and back!

281
00:16:56 --> 00:17:00
By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-Emeans "you are".

282
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
Y-O-U-R means "your".

283
00:17:02 --> 00:17:07
I can't believe I thought of gettingback with you! We are so over.

284
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
Fine by me!

285
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
Those spelling tips will be handySaturday nights at home...

286
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

287
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
Sorry!

288
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
All that sleep you'll misswishing you were with me!

289
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
Don't worry about me falling asleep.

290
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
I still have your letter!

291
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
Just so you know,it's not that common.

292
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
It doesn't happen to every guy.

293
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
And it is a big deal!

294
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
I knew it!

295
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
Gin.

296
00:17:39 --> 00:17:42
We were playing gin?

297
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
If we were a couple,we could play naked.

298
00:17:46 --> 00:17:48
Would you stop?

299
00:17:49 --> 00:17:50
All right.

300
00:17:50 --> 00:17:51
I think you're great.

301
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
I think you're sweet and smart...

302
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
...and I love you.

303
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00
But you'll always be the guywho peed on me.
