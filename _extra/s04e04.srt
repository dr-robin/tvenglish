1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
Hey, new wallet?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
It was time.

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
The old condom ring in the leatherjust doesn't say "cool" anymore.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
Rachel, you just put an empty cartonback in the fridge.

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
I know,but the garbage was full.

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
Have you ever taken out the trash?

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
Well, I thought you liked doing it.

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
- Third door on the left.- Right!

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
Hey, Mr. Treeger.

10
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
What are you doing?

11
00:00:56 --> 00:00:57
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
It's a little old but...

13
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
You're clogging up the chuteI just unclogged.

14
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
I'm sorry.I don't come in here a lot.

15
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
Of course not.You're a little princess.

16
00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
Daddy, buy me a pizza.

17
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.

18
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
Daddy, make the cast of "Cats"sing "Happy Birthday" to me.

19
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
You think you can come here...

20
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
...make a mess and a big manin coveralls will clean it up?

21
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
Think of someone else for a change.

22
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
Okay, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
God, if you're going to cry about it!

24
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
The One with Ballroom Dancing

25
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Treeger made you cry?

26
00:02:19 --> 00:02:23
He said really mean thingsthat were only partly true.

27
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
I'll teach him a lesson.

28
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
Joey, don't.Let's forget about it.

29
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
That's easy for you to say.You weren't almost just killed!

30
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
All right, that's it.School is in session!

31
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
Is this a gym card?

32
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Oh yeah, gym member.

33
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
I try to go four times a week,but I've missed...

34
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
...the last 1200 times.

35
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
So why don't you quit?

36
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
You don't think I've tried?

37
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
You think I like having $50 a monthtaken from my account?

38
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
They make you goall the way down there.

39
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
They use all these phrasesand peppiness to confuse you.

40
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
And then they bring out Maria.

41
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
Who is Maria?

42
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
Oh, Maria!

43
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
You can't say no to her.

44
00:03:07 --> 00:03:12
She's like this lycra,spandex-covered, gym treat.

45
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
Do you need me to go with youand hold your hand?

46
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
You're strong enough to face her?

47
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
Oh, no. You'll have to come.

48
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
Tribbiani.

49
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
Hold on.

50
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
I'll get the plunger.

51
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
You hold on.You made my friend Rachel cry.

52
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
So you'll go and apologize to her...

53
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
...unless you want meto call the landlord.

54
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
And tell him what?

55
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
Maybe you haven't heard of"not making girls cry".

56
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
Maybe you haven't heard of theRent Stabilization Act of 1968.

57
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
I have actually not heard of that.

58
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
Your friends are violating it.

59
00:03:47 --> 00:03:50
I've been nice until now,but I don't need this grief.

60
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
I'm telling the landlord...

61
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
...Monica's illegallysubletting her grandmother's place.

62
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Your friends are out of here, pal.

63
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
Why don't you tell mesomething I don't know?

64
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
Somebody tell meI don't have to work today.

65
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
What's the matter?

66
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
My first massage isthis incredibly gorgeous guy.

67
00:04:09 --> 00:04:10
Every time I see him,I want to...

68
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
...do things to himI can't charge for.

69
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
So do them for free.

70
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
No, it is forbidden.

71
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
Mrs. Potter fires peoplefor messing around with clients.

72
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
And it's against my oathas a masseuse.

73
00:04:27 --> 00:04:27
They make you take one?

74
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
No, I made myself take one.

75
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
No fooling around with clients...

76
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
...and always be prepared.

77
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
That one's from the Boy Scouts,but it just makes good sense.

78
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Why not give him to someone else?

79
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
No, I can handle it.I'm a professional.

80
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
Pheebs, is thata new ankle bracelet?

81
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
You got a pedicure.

82
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
Your feet are all dressed up.

83
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
That's the only part he can seewhen he's on the table!

84
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
You're going to dosome feet flirting!

85
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
I don't know whatyou're talking about.

86
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
How do you explain the toe ring?

87
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
It's Arabian Princess Day at work.Leave me alone!

88
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
My hero! What happened?

89
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
I told him no one treatsmy friends like that.

90
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
And he better apologize.See you!

91
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
Wait a minute.

92
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
What did he say?

93
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
He wouldn't apologize becauseyou're living here illegally.

94
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
Instead, he'll evict you.See you later!

95
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
- You got us evicted?- I told you not to go down there.

96
00:05:31 --> 00:05:32
He made Rachel cry!

97
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Rachel always cries!

98
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
That's not true!

99
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
You go down there,and you suck up to him.

100
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
You suck likeyou've never sucked before!

101
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
All right, I'll try.

102
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
If I can't, you stay with ustill you get settled.

103
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
- Go!- All right, all right.

104
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
I'll have to check first,but he'll be cool.

105
00:05:56 --> 00:06:01
Remember what we talked about.You got to be strong.

106
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Now one more time.

107
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
Don't you want a washboard stomachand rock-hard pecs?

108
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
No, I want a flabby gutand saggy man-breasts.

109
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
That's good.

110
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
I want to quit the gym.

111
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
You want to quit?

112
00:06:22 --> 00:06:23
I want to quit the gym.

113
00:06:23 --> 00:06:28
You do realize you won't haveaccess to our new Swedish spa?

114
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
I want to quit the gym.

115
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
Dave in the Membership Officehandles quitters.

116
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
Excuse me.Are you a member?

117
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
Me?

118
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
Sorry. Members only.

119
00:06:47 --> 00:06:48
I want to quit the gym!

120
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
It's okay, man.Be strong.

121
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
Are you a member of any gym?

122
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
No, and I'm not going to be.So save your little speech.

123
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
Okay, no problem.

124
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
Could you come here?

125
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
Hi, I'm Maria.

126
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
You have really pretty feet.

127
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
These old things?

128
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
Would you spend time on mysciatic area? It's killing me.

129
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
You mean...

130
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
By sciatic, you mean...

131
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
...the towel-covered portion?

132
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
Sure, I can do that.

133
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
Because the musclesin the sciatic area can get...

134
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
...real nice and tight.

135
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
So tell me, Rick,how did you injure the area?

136
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

137
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
- Did you just bite me?- No!

138
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
Please don't kick the girls out.This was my fault.

139
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
You want me to kickyou guys out instead?

140
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
You can't. Where wouldthe chick and the duck live?

141
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
You have pets?

142
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
Those are nicknames.

143
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
I'm the "chick",and Chandler's the "duck".

144
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
I would've thoughtit was the other way around.

145
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
Come on.Let the girls stay.

146
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
I'll do whatever you want.

147
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
Really? You'd do anything?

148
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Yeah, absolutely.

149
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
I got something.

150
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
What is it?

151
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
Can you be my dancing partner?

152
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
That's not prison lingo, is it?

153
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
His dancing partner?

154
00:08:55 --> 00:08:59
There's this superintendents' dance,"The Super Ball".

155
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
He wants to impress Marge,this lady super he likes.

156
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
Why not practice with a girl?

157
00:09:05 --> 00:09:06
He's too shy.

158
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
He's not good enoughto dance with girls yet.

159
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
Yeah, right.

160
00:09:09 --> 00:09:13
He almost danced me right downthat garbage chute.

161
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
Would you let it go already?You're fine.

162
00:09:20 --> 00:09:21
So did you quit?

163
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
I almost did.

164
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
Couldn't leave Ross therewithout a spotter.

165
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?

166
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
And that's funny, why?

167
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
I was just, you know,picturing you working out, and...

168
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
Well, that's it.

169
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
We're doomed.

170
00:09:42 --> 00:09:46
They'll take $50 a month from ouraccounts for the rest of our lives.

171
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
What'll we do?

172
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
You could actually go to the gym.

173
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
Or we could go to the bank...

174
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
...close our accountsand cut them off at the source.

175
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
You're a genius.

176
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
Oh, man! But then,we won't be bank buddies.

177
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
Now there's two reasons.

178
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
You guys, remember that cute clientI told you about?

179
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
I bit him.

180
00:10:17 --> 00:10:17
Where?

181
00:10:18 --> 00:10:19
On the tushy.

182
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
And that's not against your oath?

183
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
I know,but the moment I touch him...

184
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
...I want to throw out my old oathand take a new, dirty one.

185
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
Next time, try to distract yourself.

186
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Like when I'm doingsomething exciting...

187
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
...and I don't want to get too...

188
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
...excited.

189
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
I try and think of other things.Like sandwiches...

190
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
...and baseball...

191
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
...and Chandler.

192
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
- Thank you.- Oh no, thank you.

193
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
All right, I'm here.Let's get this over with.

194
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
Okay, well...

195
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
...just follow my lead.

196
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
Don't we need to do some kindof preparation first?

197
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
Like get really drunk?

198
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
Come on. Hey, just putyour arms around me.

199
00:11:15 --> 00:11:16
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
No. It's okay.But if I'm Marge...

201
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
...my breasts are coming out my back.

202
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
Forget it!I'm not being any good at this.

203
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
My mom was right.

204
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
I'm just a big potatowith arms and legs and a head.

205
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
Come on, man.You're not a potato.

206
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
I'm sure as hell not a dancer.It's no use.

207
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
Marge will never go for me.

208
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
Come on, Treeger.Don't say that.

209
00:11:40 --> 00:11:41
You just need more practice.

210
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
Come on.Let's try it again.

211
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
Plus, it was probablymostly my fault anyway.

212
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
I'm not that comfortabledancing with a...

213
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
So how goes the dancing?Gay yet?

214
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
You guys owe me bigtime.

215
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
What was that?

216
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
You just did a little dancy thing.

217
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
- No, I didn't.- Yes, you did.

218
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
- You did a little hop.- You are so enjoying this.

219
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
No, I'm not.

220
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
And it wasn't a hop.It was a pas de bourrée.

221
00:12:23 --> 00:12:24
You know the words!

222
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
You are so into this!

223
00:12:26 --> 00:12:30
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.I'm getting pretty good at it.

224
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
This is so sweet.Joey, our little twinkletoes.

225
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
This isn't some kind of girly dance.

226
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
It's like a sport, it's manly.

227
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
- Show me some "manly" moves.- All right.

228
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
I don't know how to lead.

229
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
Hello.

230
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
We'd like to close our accounts.

231
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Close your accounts?Is there a problem?

232
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
No, we'd just like to close them.

233
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.

234
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
Would you come over here, please?

235
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
Hi, I'm Karen.

236
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
I want to quit the bank!

237
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
Okay. Baseball.

238
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
He slides into second.

239
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
come down a little.

240
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Sandwiches.

241
00:13:24 --> 00:13:25
Okay, on a plate.

242
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.

243
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
Chandler.

244
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
That's working!

245
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
Chandler's knees.

246
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
Chandler's ankles.

247
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
Chandler's ankle hair.

248
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
Oh, no!

249
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
Okay, you're all set.

250
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
Wow! That was amazing!

251
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
Was that really just an hour?

252
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
In really long hour-world.

253
00:14:00 --> 00:14:01
I have an enormous crush on you.

254
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
But since you're a client,I can't ask you out...

255
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
...even though you give methe feelings.

256
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
I had no idea.

257
00:14:11 --> 00:14:12
I can always find another masseuse.

258
00:14:13 --> 00:14:13
Really?

259
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
Yeah, really.

260
00:14:19 --> 00:14:20
What?

261
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.

262
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
Quiet down.

263
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
Mr. Simon's been waiting...Oh, my God!

264
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
Why wasn't I offered that?

265
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
I'd definitely pay more for that.

266
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
We have rules here.This is not that kind of place.

267
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
I know, but this isn'thow it looks at all...

268
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
...because Rick is my husband.

269
00:14:43 --> 00:14:44
Oh, really?

270
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
You'd better tell his other wife.

271
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
She called three timesasking where he is.

272
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
Yes, I will tell her.

273
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
So you didn't leave the bank?

274
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
And somehow we ended upwith a joint checking account.

275
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
What will you ever use that for?

276
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
To pay for the gym.

277
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
So I had a great day.

278
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
Rick and I hit it off.We were making out.

279
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
Then my boss walked inand fired me for being a whore.

280
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
- You got fired?- Oh, my gosh!

281
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
It's so weird. I have neverbeen fired from anything.

282
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
Sweetie.

283
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
I started walking around,not knowing what to do next.

284
00:15:25 --> 00:15:29
I started asking people on the streetif they wanted massages.

285
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
Then these policemen thoughtI was a whore too.

286
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
It's really been a bad day,whore-wise.

287
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
Hey, Duck.Is Chick here?

288
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.

289
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47
Ready for our last practice?

290
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
We're not getting that spin rightbecause my place is too small.

291
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
- Want to use our place?- No, I had another idea.

292
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
We did it!

293
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
That was incredible!

294
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
That was amazing!We totally nailed it!

295
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
Hey, listen.Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.

296
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
Oh, my God!Look at the time.

297
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
I got to catch the bus to the ball.

298
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
Good luck.

299
00:16:43 --> 00:16:47
Unless you want to practicethe fox trot. Or the tango?

300
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
Thanks, but no.

301
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
You see, I think I'm readyto dance with girls.

302
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
- Go get them, Treeger.- Right.

303
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
You want to come?Marge has a friend.

304
00:17:03 --> 00:17:04
Really?

305
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
You'd dance good with her.She's the same size as me.

306
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
No, I'm good.

307
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
It looks like you've gotgreat experience.

308
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
Let's see.Reason for leaving last job?

309
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
They thought I was a whore.

310
00:17:29 --> 00:17:33
Okay. We'll give you a callif anything comes up.

311
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
