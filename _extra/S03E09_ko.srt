Friends Season3_episode9 - The One With The Football Rip & Subtitle by『조그셔틀』™ Create Date : 02/11/2004 -->   추수감사절인데 풋볼만 보고 있지 말고 좀 도와줘

2
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,133
- 그래 - 알았어

3
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:17,308
레이첼, 동그란 원 안에 마시멜로 좀 넣을래?

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,313
아니, 동그란 원 안에 마시멜로 넣는 건 네가 해

5
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,983
난 이거나 할래

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,596
매번 이렇다니까

7
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,080
나도 잠깐 엉덩이 붙이고 앉아서 풋볼이나 봐야겠다

8
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:32,883
전반 끝났다

9
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,694
우리, 시합 안 할래? 편 갈라서 한 판 하자

10
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,422
재밌겠다

11
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,568
나도 해도 돼? 풋볼 한번도 안해 봤는데

12
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,935
그럼, 챈들러 커버해

13
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,370
아니, 난 하기 싫어

14
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,905
하자, 너 재니스랑 헤어지고 아무 의욕도 없잖아

15
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,671
그런 소리 마

16
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,508
욕실 가운 입고, 종일 땅콩 버터 먹고 싶고

17
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,017
아침부터 술독에 빠지고 싶어 나도 목표가 있는 놈이야

18
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,351
챈들러, 이제 그만 잊어버려

19
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,152
시합하면서 시원한 바람을 쐬면 재니스도 잊혀질 거야

20
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,796
너 시합 안 하면 숫자가 안 맞으니까 다들 화낼 거야

21
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,660
- 하자 - 알았어, 할게

22
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,628
야호!

23
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,633
- 하자, 로스 - 뭐?

24
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,829
풋볼하자

25
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,307
모니카랑 난 풋볼하면 안돼

26
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,680
누가 그래, 너희 엄마?

27
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,077
그래

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,788
추수감사절 때마다 우린 풋볼 시합을 했어

29
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,356
일명 '겔러볼'이라고 했지

30
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,650
설마, 그게 자랑은 아니겠지?

31
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,596
로스 오빠랑 난 주장이었어

32
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,097
서로 이기려고 눈이 멀었는데 어느 해인가...

33
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:53,668
내가 실수로 오빠 코를 부러뜨렸어

34
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,268
그건 실수가 아니었어

35
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:02,173
내가 따라붙으니까 피둥피둥한 팔로 내 얼굴을 갈기고

36
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,411
냅다 도망쳤어

37
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,516
어쨌든 우리가 터치다운했어

38
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,056
시합에 이기지도 못했잖아

39
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,352
터치다운은 기록되지도 않았어 불법 행위에 야만 행위였거든

40
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,290
코를 부러뜨린 거 말야

41
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,260
내가 이겼어

42
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,299
그럼 왜 '겔러컵'을 못 받았지?

43
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,233
'겔러컵'도 있었어?

44
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,032
그래, 시합에서 이기면 받는 트로피였어

45
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,676
아빠가 무승부라고 하셨지 우리 싸우는 거에 신물이 나셨거든

46
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,073
그래서 트로피를 가져가서...

47
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,284
호수에 던져버리셨어

48
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,849
그래서 저주가 시작된 거야?

49
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,024
어쨌든...

50
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,261
엄마가 그때부터 다시는 풋볼 못하게 하셨어

51
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,732
괜찮아 이제 시합해도 될 거야

52
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,833
벌써 12년이나 지났잖아

53
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:01,899
잠깐 좀 볼까?

54
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,142
뭐?

55
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,981
좋아, 하자

56
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,887
잠깐, 공원에 어떻게 가지? 엄마가 길 건너지 말랬는데

57
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,657
피비, 받아

58
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,426
좋아, 시작하자

59
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,997
나한테 던져, 나한테!

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,723
간다

61
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,503
얼굴 맞을 뻔했어

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,601
좋아, 우리 주장 고르자

63
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,967
꼬붕들도

64
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,511
어떻게 하는 건데?

65
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,841
- 찍기 하자 - 뭐?

66
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,145
- 찍자구 - 찍는 거야

67
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,720
로스 오빠랑 내가 주장이야

68
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,616
- 나부터 찍을게, 먼저 고를 거야 - 좋아

69
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,723
- 조이 - 고마워

70
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,785
모니카, 난 네 친구야

71
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,656
자기도 뽑힐 테니까 기다려봐 챈들러

72
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,267
- 로스? - 피비

73
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,800
봐, 자기 고르잖아

74
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,308
고른 게 아니라 나만 남은 거잖아

75
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:20,216
좋아, 그럼 쓰레기통에서 가로등까지 하는 거다

76
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,977
우리가 시작할게

77
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,782
좋아, 잘 들어 정확히 28분 후에

78
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,419
부저가 울리는 거다

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,718
꼭 프로 같은데

80
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,690
좋아, 작전 타임 이리 와

81
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,491
잠깐, 기다려

82
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,500
신난다 작전 타임은 처음이야

83
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,665
- 좋아 - 챈들러를 어떻게 생각하니?

84
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,539
- 피비, 뭐하는 건지 알아? - 그럼

85
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,478
조이가 공을 잡으면 너랑 내가 블로킹하는 거야

86
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,273
블로킹이 뭐야?

87
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,948
뭐하는지 안다고 했잖아

88
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,647
시합 얘긴 줄 몰랐지

89
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,113
해산

90
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,915
이 공은 재니스다 이 공은 재니스다

91
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,999
이 나쁜... 조심해

92
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,932
미안, 미안해 그냥 손으로 던진다

93
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,033
- 내가 받을게 - 뛰어!

94
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,982
7대 빵입니다!

95
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:31,988
괜찮아?

96
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,155
그래, 가자

97
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,358
패자가 걸어가네

98
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,461
패자가 말을 하네

99
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,522
그만해, 패자가 까부네

100
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,360
43, 74...

101
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,902
- 그냥 할래? - 그래

102
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,470
- 간다! - 원 미시시피, 투 미시시피, 쓰리!

103
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,012
여기야, 여기

104
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,850
받을 뻔했어

105
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,921
- 7대 7 될 뻔했어 - 그래

106
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,921
이번엔 쭉 내려가서 오른쪽으로 가는 거다

107
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,220
- 알았어 - 해산!

108
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,521
잠깐, 난 어떡해?

109
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,322
넌... 그냥 돌아

110
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,226
얼마 동안?

111
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,698
눈앞이 노래질 때까지

112
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:19,767
- 알았어 - 해산

113
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,631
준비, 간다!

114
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,809
원 미시시피, 투 미시시피 받아, 받아!

115
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,336
안돼, 안돼!

116
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,882
공 잡아줘서 고마워요

117
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,951
- 미식 축구하는 거예요? - 네

118
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,985
외국에서 오셨나봐요

119
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,194
네덜란드예요

120
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,627
안녕, 난 조이예요

121
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,033
난 마하예요

122
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,868
미안해요, 네덜란드 뒷말은 못 알아듣겠어요

123
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,300
조이, 풋볼하다 말고 뭐해? 안녕, 난 챈들러예요

124
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,473
안녕, 챈들러

125
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,474
이름이 네덜란드인데 마한이라고도 한대

126
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,241
- 마하예요 - 마카

127
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,420
- 마하 - 마하아안

128
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,889
뭐해? 계속해야지 두 번째 다운이야

129
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,124
세 번째야

130
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,690
웃기지 마, 두 번째야

131
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,694
- 와우 - 뭐가 와우야?

132
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,260
잘났다고 박박 우기는 거 보니까 놀랍기만 하다

133
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,234
우겼다고? 두 번째 맞잖아

134
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,937
그래, 두 번째라고 해

135
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,469
불쌍해서 봐준다

136
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:32,672
다 들었어

137
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,139
들으라고 한 소리야

138
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,450
여기서 구경해도 돼요?

139
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,752
- 그럼요, 앉아서 봐요 - 어서 앉아요

140
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,512
- 잘됐다 - 그럼

141
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,484
전화번호 물어보면 어떨까?

142
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,827
고맙지만 내가 직접 해야 점수가 올라갈 거야

143
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,859
그게 아니라 날 위해서 물어봐 달라고...

144
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,399
재니스를 잊으라고 했잖아

145
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,436
그야 그렇지

146
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,501
- 네 생각이 그렇다면 양보할게 - 고마워

147
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,706
뭐? 양보한다고?

148
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,312
나 혼자 나서봤자 어림없다는 소리야 뭐야?

149
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,813
큰 소리 내고 싶진 않지만

150
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,083
그래!

151
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,086
괜찮아, 넌 여자엔 약하지만 숫자에는 강하잖아

152
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,124
숫자? 숫자로 밀어부치려고?

153
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,664
좋아, 관두자

154
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,667
양보하지 마 누가 이기나 붙어보자구

155
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,264
챈들러, 왼쪽으로 무작정 달리는 거야, 알았지?

156
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,409
- 그리고 자기? - 알아, 계속 돌라고?

157
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,078
난 작전 타임이나 하고 왔다갔다만 하는 것 같아

158
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,576
그럼 나가서 구경할래?

159
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,751
- 잠깐 좀 볼까? - 그래

160
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,258
좋아

161
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,483
- 좋아, 간다 - 간다!

162
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,321
원 미시시피, 투 미시시피, 쓰리 미시시피

163
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,061
놓쳤잖아

164
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,569
뭐하는 거야? 내가 제일 좋아하는 옷인데

165
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,267
두 개로 갈라줬잖아

166
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,110
나 계산 잘하지?

167
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,207
좋아, 양보하려고 했는데

168
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,613
없었던 걸로 하고 자존심 상할 각오나 하셔

169
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,220
그래, 평생 각오하면서 살고 있다

170
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,687
지금 네 얘길 하는 거야!

171
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,193
좋아, 간다

172
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,355
동점이야, 시간 없어

173
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,464
42, 38, 간다!

174
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,259
내가 받을게

175
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,731
팔 부러졌나봐

176
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,274
- 피비, 달려 - 피비, 뛰어

177
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,277
- 터치다운이야 - 터치다운!

178
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:51,811
아니, 부저가 울렸어 이건 점수에 포함 안 돼

179
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,980
- 부저는 나중에 울렸어 - 전에 울렸어

180
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,517
- 나중에 - 전에

181
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,416
- 그게 문제가 돼? - 그럼!

182
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,149
터치다운했어, 최초의 터치다운이야, 그러니까...

183
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,952
피비, 그건 알지만 점수는 안돼

184
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,923
- 왜 안된다는 거야? - 사기꾼이 우기기까지 하네

185
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,735
세상에

186
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,398
좋아, 오빠는 유치하게 굴어 난 오빠랑 달라

187
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,666
그래

188
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:17,904
다리나 부러져라

189
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,171
좋아, 속임수를 써서 이기겠다? 맘대로 해

190
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,281
피비, 터치다운했다고 쳐 네가 이겼어

191
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,746
- 신난다! - 아니

192
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,747
또 오빠 술수에 넘어갈 줄 알아?

193
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:36,586
코뼈가 부러졌다고, 귀가 짝짝이라 부저가 빨랐다고 핑계 대지마

194
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,027
동점이라고 하고 후반에 다시 하자구

195
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,995
난 사기꾼하고 시합 안 해

196
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,930
하고 싶어도 다리 부러져서 못해!

197
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,569
시합 안하곤 못 배길걸

198
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,709
왜 못 배겨?

199
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,645
이기면 이걸 가져가니까

200
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,511
'겔러컵'이잖아

201
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,153
사자 머리 인형 너희도 봤니?

202
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,581
응

203
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,148
그렇군

204
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,794
어디서 났어?

205
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,330
엄마 아빠가 오빠 병원에 데려갔을 때

206
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,730
내가 호수에 헤엄쳐 들어가 꺼냈지

207
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,605
내 컵이야

208
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,866
아니, 갖고 싶으면 시합에서 이기면 되잖아

209
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,101
좋아, 근데 저녁은 언제 먹어?

210
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,315
피비, 이리 와 시합해야지, 작전 타임

211
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,316
조이, 시합에 집중해

212
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,080
그게 말처럼 쉬워? 챈들러가 여자 가까이 있잖아

213
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,793
좋아, 챈들러만 해결하면 시합에 집중할 수 있겠어?

214
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,357
어떻게 하려고?

215
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,188
공이나 받게 해

216
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,925
- 나머지는 내가 할게 - 알았어

217
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,260
- 가자 - 좋아

218
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,105
조심해!

219
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,876
여자한테 태클 당했대요

220
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,714
이런 구경하기 힘들답니다

221
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,812
왜 태클을 걸고 난리야?

222
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,883
왜? 건드리기만 했는데 넘어진 거야

223
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,124
거칠게 하겠다 이거지? 좋았어

224
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,776
너무 재밌다

225
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,148
어디서 난 거야?

226
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,650
한참 놀았더니 배고파서...

227
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,288
42대 21 상대가 안돼, 우리가 이겼지롱

228
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,493
네가 이긴 것도 당연하지 너부터 팀을 골랐으니까

229
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,787
우기지 마

230
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,294
그냥 받아들이면 되잖아 내가 오빠보다 낫다는 증거야

231
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,728
할 말 없으니까 코웃음으로 무마하시겠다?

232
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,039
좋아, 내가 증명해 보일까?

233
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,934
조이랑 레이첼을 바꿔도 우리 팀이 이길 수 있어

234
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,406
뭐? 남자 대 여자라구?

235
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,172
말도 안되는 소리하지 마 내가 터치다운 세 번은 한다

236
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,909
그럼 해봐

237
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,116
여자들한테 질까봐 무서워서 못하는 거 아냐?

238
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:56,055
좋아, 레이첼, 모니카 편 해 조이, 넌 우리 편이야

239
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,463
날 바꾸는 거야?

240
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:01,723
이리 와, 레이첼 이기는 팀에 들어오면 좋잖아

241
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:02,866
나 게임해도 돼?

242
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:04,828
좋아!

243
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,966
게임 끝났어요? 식사하는 거예요?

244
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,164
아뇨, 아직이요 팀을 바꾸는 거예요

245
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:14,272
같은 팀에서 뛰면 챈들러가 나 때문에 실력발휘 못할걸요

246
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,176
좋아, 그럼 시작하자

247
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,644
잠깐만, 조이

248
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,149
네덜란드 사람들이 어디서 왔게?

249
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,296
펜실배니아 네덜란드는 펜실배니아에서 왔지

250
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,633
다른 사람은? 네덜란드 근처에서 왔을까?

251
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,803
웃겼어

252
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,907
네덜란드는 피터팬이랑 팅커벨이 사는 동화 속 나라야

253
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,807
맙소사

254
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,010
지리 공부는 나중에 하고 시합이나 하자구

255
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,881
- 아니, 나 얘하고 시합 못해 - 나도 마찬가지야

256
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,082
좋아, 더는 못 봐줘 솔직히 말해봐요

257
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,090
둘 중에 누가 더 좋아요?

258
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,560
지금 뭐하는 거야?

259
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:09,832
둘 중에요?

260
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,436
데이트하자고 한다면요 풍차 나라에 누굴 데려갈래요?

261
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:20,441
지금 그걸 골라야 한다면 좀 이상하긴 하지만...

262
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,940
- 챈들러로 하죠 - 좋았어!

263
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,783
잠깐, 질문을 이해 못한 거 같은데

264
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,523
그럼 후크 선장이 직접 설명해주시지

265
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,786
미안해요, 조이 제 진심이에요

266
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,591
들었지? 진심이라잖아 양보맨 씨!

267
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,199
내가 이기고 네가 졌어 다같이 축하의 박수를!

268
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,363
우후!

269
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:54,841
다시 생각해보니까 아무도 안 고르는 게 좋겠어요

270
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,476
뭐라구요?

271
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:03,348
이제 보니까 당신 너무 얄팍하고 가벼워요, 안녕

272
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,549
안됐다, 앞으로도 여자랑 잠자리 할 일은 없겠구나

273
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,056
그게 중요한 게 아냐 중요한 건 날 골랐단 거지

274
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:17,632
이제부터 난 데이트할 때 넌 "준비, 땡"이나 하면서 놀라구

275
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,701
싸움은 나중에 하자 이럴 시간이 없어

276
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,738
우리가 지고 있어 여자들한테 지고 있다구

277
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,068
여자들한테 왜 져?

278
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,939
42대 21이야

279
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,807
말도 안돼 아까 내가 다 이겨 놨는데

280
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,184
시합하는 거야 마는 거야? 털복숭이 친구들!

281
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,191
꼭 이겨야 돼 세상 모든 여자들을 위해서야

282
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,895
지금까지 만났던 재수없는 데이트 상대들을 생각해봐

283
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,088
사랑을 나누면서도 한쪽 눈으론 TV 보느라 정신없는 남자들을!

284
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,596
너도 한쪽 안경 쓴 사람이랑 데이트해봤어?

285
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,204
세상 모든 여자들을 위한 시합이야

286
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,532
- 쓸어버리자구 - 그래, 쓸어버리자!

287
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:03,073
좋아, 솔직히 나도 쓸어버리고 싶지만 쟤들은 남자야

288
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,909
어떻게 남자 셋을 이겨?

289
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,375
아직 1분 30초 남았으니까 2점은 딸 수 있어

290
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,847
2점이면 돼

291
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,992
피비, 후크 다시 풀어

292
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,155
레이첼, 넌 계속 돌아

293
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,264
싫어, 나도 시켜줘 아무도 날 커버 안한단 말야

294
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,023
그럴 만한 이유가 있어

295
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,199
무시하지 마 나도 뭐든 할 수 있어

296
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,964
공 던질게, 던지게 해줘 나도 선수잖아

297
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,802
그래, 던지게 해줘

298
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,502
좋아, 뒤에서 어슬렁거리다 공 받아서 피비한테 던져

299
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,839
- 그래 - 좋아

300
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,116
해산, 해산

301
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,842
좋아, 32, 71, 간다!

302
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,132
미안, 괜찮아?

303
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,903
안 괜찮아!

304
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,604
미안해, 한꺼번에 달려드니까 어떻게 할지 모르겠더라구

305
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,332
30초 남았다

306
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,737
좋아, 그럼 사자 머리 인형 우리 거야?

307
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,773
빨리, 시간 없단 말야

308
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,542
- 작전 타임! - 좋아

309
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,185
이번이 마지막이네

310
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,123
피비, 공 받을 준비하고 레이첼, 넌 계속 돌아

311
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,387
알았어

312
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:58,686
해산

313
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,080
내가 해냈다, 터치다운! 우리가 이겼어

314
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,176
야호!

315
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,216
레이첼, 안됐지만...

316
00:20:55,454 --> 00:21:00,016
엔드 존은 저 기둥부터야 5피트 모자라, 그러니까...

317
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:01,684
우리가 이긴 거야

318
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,764
잠깐, 어떻게 되는 거야?

319
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,169
아직 아웃 된 거 아니니까 시합 안 끝났잖아

320
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,105
- 이거 놔, 놓으란 말야 - 안돼, 네가 놔

321
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,404
- 이리 내놔! - 난 연약한 여자라구

322
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:28,075
그만하자, 추수감사절인데 이기고 지는 게 무슨 상관이야

323
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,321
중요한 건 네덜란드 아가씨가 날 골랐다는 거야

324
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,394
네덜란드는 챈들러를 사랑해! 감사합니다, 아름다운 밤이에요!

325
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,537
우리 풋볼 자주 하자

326
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,798
리그 같은 것도 있잖아

327
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,167
내셔널 풋볼 리그가 있지 않던가?

328
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,141
그래, 있지 일요일, 월요일 밤에 시합해

329
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,147
아쉽다 월요일 밤에 일 나가는데

330
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,287
정말 맛있다

331
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,619
애들 불러와야 되지 않아?

332
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,417
배고프면 들어오겠지

333
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:09,723
놔

334
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,725
- 네가 놔 - 싫어

335
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,333
왜 항상 우리만 공 붙들고 나동그러져 있지?

336
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,195
몰라, 다른 사람들은 관심이 없나봐

337
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,875
눈 온다

338
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,716
- 이거 놔 - 제발 좀 놔

339
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,602
Oh, come on!

340
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,808
It's your Thanksgiving too. Instead of watching football, you could help.

341
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,308
We know.

342
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,582
You wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.

343
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,986
No, you want to put them in concentric circles.

344
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,018
I want to do this.

345
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,928
Every year.

346
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,830
The One With the Football

347
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,413
To the 10, to the 5. Touchdown, Giants!

348
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,154
You know, for once, I am gonna try to watch one of these things.

349
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,658
Halftime.

350
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,822
Who wants to throw the ball around? Get a little 3-on-3 going?

351
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,727
-That would be fun! -Can I play too?

352
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,301
I've never played football, ever.

353
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,766
Great! You can cover Chandler.

354
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,302
I don't really want to play.

355
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,673
You never do anything since you and Janice broke up.

356
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:54,743
Not true.

357
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:58,450
I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.

358
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,950
And start drinking in the morning. Don't say I don't have goals!

359
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,022
You have to start getting over her, all right?

360
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,125
If you play, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.

361
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:13,924
If you don't, everyone will be mad at you because the teams won't be even.

362
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,927
All right, I'll play.

363
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,261
Let's do it! Ross?

364
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,335
-What? -Wanna play football?

365
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,445
Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.

366
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,807
Says who? Your mom?

367
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,687
Every Thanksgiving, we used to have a touch football game...

368
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,620
...called The Geller Bowl.

369
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,123
No, no, no. You say that proudly!

370
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,790
Anyway, Ross and l were always captains.

371
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,191
It got kind of competitive, and one year, Geller Bowl Vl...

372
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,904
... I accidentally broke Ross' nose.

373
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,302
It was so not an accident.

374
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,012
She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw...

375
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,044
... her big fat grandma-arm elbow in my face...

376
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,841
...and just kept running.

377
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,353
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.

378
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,053
You did not win the game. The touchdown didn't count...

379
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:17,252
... because of the spectacularly illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.

380
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,659
I won the game.

381
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,097
Yeah? Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?

382
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,830
There was a Geller Cup?

383
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,203
Yes, the trophy you got if you won the game.

384
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,777
But Dad said nobody won, and he was sick of our fighting.

385
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,742
So he took the trophy...

386
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,746
...threw it in the lake.

387
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,216
And was the curse lifted?

388
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,423
Anyway...

389
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,394
... Mom said we weren't allowed to play football again.

390
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,768
You know what? I think we should play a game.

391
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,937
I mean, come on. It's been 12 years.

392
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,139
Can I see you for a second?

393
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,210
Wuss!

394
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,574
All right, we're gonna play.

395
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,285
Wait. How we gonna get there? My mom won't let me cross the street.

396
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,818
Here you go.

397
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,420
-Let's bring it in. -Wait.

398
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,929
Honey, throw it to me!

399
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:27,962
Here you go.

400
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,402
That almost hit me in the face!

401
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,467
We have to pick captains.

402
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,573
And then "Tenilles."

403
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,512
So how do we decide that?

404
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,009
-Why don't we just bunny up? -What?

405
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,444
-Bunny! -Bunny!

406
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,152
Looks like Ross and I are captains.

407
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,981
I bunnied first, so I get to pick first. Joey.

408
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,124
-Thank you. -Monica!

409
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,187
I'm your best friend.

410
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,656
Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked.

411
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,833
Sweetie, now I pick you.

412
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,136
You don't pick me. You're stuck with me!

413
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,780
Okay. So let's see.

414
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,111
Let's play from the trash can to the light post, right?

415
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,843
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.

416
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,717
People, listen. I've got 28 minutes...

417
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,853
... before I have to baste again.

418
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,051
Wow, just like in the pros.

419
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,286
Okay, huddle up!

420
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,864
-Huddle up over here! -Wait for me! Wait for me!

421
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,399
Oh, cool! My first huddle.

422
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,405
So what do you guys really think of Chandler?

423
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,812
You know what you're doing, right?

424
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,406
Joey will catch it. We'll block.

425
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,808
What's "block"?

426
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,749
-I thought you knew what you were doing. -I thought you meant in life!

427
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,554
Break!

428
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,054
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.

429
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,898
Son of a!

430
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,367
-Come on! -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

431
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,698
You know what? We're just gonna throw it.

432
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,703
I got it!

433
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,342
Go, go, go!

434
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,078
Score! Seven to nothing!

435
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:31,889
Honey, you okay?

436
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,353
Come on, let's go.

437
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,188
Losers walk.

438
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,091
Yeah? Losers talk.

439
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,390
Actually, losers rhyme.

440
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,860
Forty-three...

441
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,564
...seventy-four....

442
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,200
You wanna go shotgun?

443
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,906
-One Mississippi, two Mississippi.... -Over here! Over here!

444
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,944
I almost caught it!

445
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,614
Great. Now the score's seven to almost seven.

446
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:09,618
On this play, I want you to do a down-and-out to the right, okay?

447
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,659
-Break! -Wait. What am I gonna do?

448
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:12,796
You?

449
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,321
You go long.

450
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,591
How long?

451
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,063
Until we start to look very small.

452
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:19,937
Break!

453
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,971
One Mississippi

454
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,800
Switch! Switch! Switch!

455
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,088
Thanks for stopping our ball.

456
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,189
You are playing American football?

457
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,590
Wow! You're, like, from a whole other country!

458
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,298
I'm Dutch.

459
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,863
Hi, I'm Joey.

460
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,159
I am Margha.

461
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,803
Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.

462
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,767
You wanna play football or Hi, I'm Chandler.

463
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,773
Hello, Chandler.

464
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,878
Her name is Dutch and also "Margham."

465
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,714
Come on, guys! Let's go! Second down!

466
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,718
-Hello? It's third down. -No, it's not. It's second.

467
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,493
Wow.

468
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,856
"Wow" what?

469
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,068
How it just amazes me that you're still pulling stuff like this.

470
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,406
-Pulling what? It's second down. -Okay, it's second down.

471
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,003
Take all the second downs you need.

472
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,506
-I heard that. -Well, I said it loud.

473
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,474
It is okay if I stay and watch?

474
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,686
-Just sit right there. -Yeah, why don't you stick around?

475
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,548
-That went well. -I think so.

476
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,724
I was thinking about asking her for her number.

477
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:51,726
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself.

478
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:57,832
I was thinking about for me, as part of that getting-over-Janice thing.

479
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,698
Oh, yeah. That.

480
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,766
If it means that much, I'll let you have her.

481
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,101
Thanks.

482
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,101
"Let me have her"?

483
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,508
You mean if you didn't, I wouldn't have a shot?

484
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,542
I don't like to say it out loud...

485
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,278
... but yeah!

486
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,118
We all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.

487
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,522
Math? You're giving me math?

488
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,924
All right, you know what? Forget about it.

489
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,633
You go for the girl. We'll see who gets her.

490
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,872
I want you to run a post-pattern to the left. And, sweetie

491
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,303
Yeah, I know. Go long.

492
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,206
All I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.

493
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,045
Well, you wanna just stay out there?

494
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,114
Can I see that for a second?

495
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,484
Okay, let's go.

496
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,955
-I got Chandler! -Hike!

497
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,129
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi.

498
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,594
Fumble!

499
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,598
What's the matter with you? This is my favorite jersey.

500
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,766
Well, now you have two.

501
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,646
Hey, I am good at math!

502
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,142
That's it. I was still gonna let you have her.

503
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,648
But now, prepare to feel bad about yourself.

504
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,254
I've been preparing for that my entire life!

505
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,155
Or something about you that's mean!

506
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,457
Come on, guys. Let's go.

507
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,527
Tie score. We're running out of time.

508
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,092
Forty-two, 38, hike!

509
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,325
I got it!

510
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,429
Broken boobs!

511
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,671
-Pheebs, run! -Run, Phoebe, run!

512
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,372
Touchdown! Touchdown!

513
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,776
The buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.

514
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,879
-After the snap. -Before the snap.

515
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,380
-After. -Before.

516
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,350
-Does it really matter? -Yes!

517
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,150
But I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown.

518
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,794
Pheebs, that's great. Doesn't count.

519
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,963
-Does so count. -Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

520
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,166
Oh, my God!

521
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,535
That's fine. Maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.

522
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,370
Dead leg!

523
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,080
Okay, fine. You want to win by cheating, go ahead.

524
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,340
The touchdown does count. You win.

525
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,815
I won't do this again. I wanna beat you when you can't blame it...

526
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,654
...on the broken nose or the buzzer or the fact that you might have mono.

527
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,256
Let's just call this tie score and it's halftime.

528
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,932
First, I don't play with cheaters.

529
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,194
Second of all, you know I had swollen glands!

530
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,503
You know what? I think you'll play.

531
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,937
Oh, really? Why's that?

532
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,941
Because the winner gets this.

533
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,742
The Geller Cup!

534
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,211
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?

535
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,581
Okay, good.

536
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,461
Where the hell did you get that?

537
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,963
When you went to the hospital for your nose...

538
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,066
...I swam into the lake and fished it out.

539
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,238
That cup is mine!

540
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,704
No, it's not. You want it, you're gonna have to win it.

541
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,571
So are we not having dinner at all?

542
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,208
Come on, let's go. It's time to get serious. Huddle up.

543
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,682
IKeep your head in the game.

544
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,389
It's hard, you know? His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.

545
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,225
If I take Chandler out of the running, will you be able to focus?

546
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,396
-What are you gonna do? -Just make sure he catches the ball.

547
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,631
I'll do the rest.

548
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,466
-Come on, you wuss! -Okay, come on.

549
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,402
I got it!

550
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,731
Come on! This way! Come on!

551
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,037
Look out!

552
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,338
Tackled by a girl! Bet you don't see that every day.

553
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,050
What's with the tackling?

554
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,542
What?

555
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,919
I just touched him and he went over.

556
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,091
Okay. You wanna play rough? We can play rough.

557
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,262
Let's get ready to rumble!

558
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,298
-Go, go, go! -Get her! Get her!

559
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,039
I love this game!

560
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,275
Where'd you get that?

561
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,913
I went really long.

562
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,083
Forty-two to 21.

563
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,813
Like the turkey, Ross is done!

564
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,589
You got to pick first, so you got the better team.

565
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,765
Pathetic! Why can't you just accept that we're winning...

566
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,296
... because I'm better than you?

567
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,334
Oh, what a great argument. Exhaling!

568
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,835
All right, I'll prove it to you.

569
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,843
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel and I'll still win the game.

570
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,341
What? The guys against the girls?

571
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,106
That's ridiculous because I'm only down by three touchdowns.

572
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,012
Then bring it on!

573
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,518
Unless you're afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.

574
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:56,159
Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica. Joey, you're with me.

575
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,328
I can't believe you're trading me.

576
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,760
Let's see what it's like to be on a winning team for a change.

577
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,662
You're gonna let me play?

578
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,263
All right, then!

579
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,200
The game is over? We eat now?

580
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,305
The game's not over. We're switching teams.

581
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,843
Chandler finds me so intimidating that it's better if we're on the same team.

582
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,008
Okay, let's play. Let's go.

583
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,682
Hold on a second.

584
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,446
Where do Dutch people come from?

585
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,056
Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch come from Pennsylvania.

586
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,858
And the other Dutch people?

587
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,730
They come from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?

588
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,869
Nice try.

589
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,236
The Netherlands is this make-believe place...

590
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,341
...where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell live.

591
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,978
Oh, my.

592
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,182
Enough "geography for the insane." Let's play ball.

593
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,547
I'm not playing with this guy.

594
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,217
-Fine with me. -I've had enough of this.

595
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:03,427
Let's just cut to the chase. Heidi, which of my boys do you like?

596
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,385
What are you doing?

597
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,892
What are you doing?

598
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,428
Which do I like?

599
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,332
Yeah, for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill?

600
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,498
Well, if I had to choose right now...

601
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,507
...which, by the way, I find really weird...

602
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,939
... I would have to say Chandler.

603
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,851
Wait a minute. She didn't understand the question.

604
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:33,285
Why don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her?

605
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,593
I'm sorry. That is my truth.

606
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,389
You hear that? That is her truth, Mr. "I'll Let You Have Her"!

607
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,294
I win! You suck! I rule all!

608
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,628
Mini-wave in celebration of me!

609
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:55,105
I am now thinking I would like to change my answer to "no one."

610
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,739
What?

611
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,049
I now find you shallow...

612
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,877
...and a dork.

613
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,712
Bye-bye.

614
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,221
Nice going.

615
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,992
You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.

616
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,295
It doesn't matter, because she picked me.

617
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,295
From now on, I get the dates...

618
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,297
...and you stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!

619
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,601
Save the breakthroughs for therapy. The clock is ticking.

620
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,570
We have no time and we are losing to girls.

621
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,301
We're not gonna lose to girls.

622
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,943
It's 42-21!

623
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,308
This sucks! I was just up by that much!

624
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,276
Are we playing football or what? Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!

625
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,183
We have to do this. We're playing for women everywhere.

626
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,987
Think about every lousy date you ever had.

627
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,026
Every guy who kept one eye on the TV while you were making out.

628
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,496
Oh, my God. You dated someone with a glass eye too?

629
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,301
Come on, okay? This is for all womankind. Let's kill them!

630
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,941
Yeah! IKill them!

631
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,709
All right, I want to kill them too.

632
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,345
But they're boys.

633
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,979
You know, how are we gonna beat three boys?

634
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,514
A minute and a half left and we're down by two points.

635
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,980
Two points, ladies.

636
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,655
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

637
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,225
Rachel, you go long.

638
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,159
No, don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.

639
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,094
Honey, there's a reason.

640
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,098
I'm not lame, okay? I can do something.

641
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,840
Would you let me throw? This is my game too.

642
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,702
Let her throw the ball.

643
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,539
Sweep behind, I'll pitch it. You throw it downfield to Phoebe.

644
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,769
Thank you.

645
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:10,947
-Break! -Break!

646
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,180
All right, here we go.

647
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,682
Thirty-two, 71, hike!

648
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,514
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi!

649
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,286
Go, go, go!

650
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,463
Catch it!

651
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,727
-I'm so sorry. Are you okay? -No, I'm not okay!

652
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,540
They were coming at me and I didn't know what to do.

653
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,743
Thirty seconds left on the timer.

654
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,036
So we get to take that stupid troll thing home.

655
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,216
Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time.

656
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,941
Huddle up!

657
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,422
This is our last huddle!

658
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,225
All right, Phoebe, get open. Rachel...

659
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,290
...go long.

660
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,893
Okay.

661
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,154
Break!

662
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,877
I did it! Touchdown! We did it!

663
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,786
You know? Funny thing, actually. The end zone starts at that pole.

664
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,991
So you're five feet short. So...

665
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,117
...we win!

666
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,561
Yes, yes, yes!

667
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,856
Wait, explain something, though.

668
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,331
If nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going?

669
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,043
-Let me in, let me in! -No way! Let go!

670
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,906
Let go?! I'm a tiny little woman!

671
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,479
Come on, it's Thanksgiving!

672
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,015
It's not important who wins or loses.

673
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,313
The important thing is the Dutch girl picked me!

674
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:37,527
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

675
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,561
We should play football more often.

676
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,330
Maybe there's a league we could join.

677
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,544
Isn't there a "national football league"?

678
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,213
Yes, there is. They play on Sundays and Monday nights.

679
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,940
Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.

680
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:06,554
This stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?

681
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,783
When they're hungry, they'll come in.

682
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,894
-Let go! -No, you let go!

683
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,800
How come it's always us left holding the ball?

684
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,936
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.

685
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,478
Hey, it's starting to snow.
