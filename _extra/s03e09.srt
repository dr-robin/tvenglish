1
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,602
Oh, come on!

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,808
It's your Thanksgiving too. Instead of
watching football, you could help.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,308
We know.

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,582
You wanna put the marshmallows
in concentric circles.

5
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,986
No, you want to put them
in concentric circles.

6
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,018
I want to do this.

7
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,928
Every year.

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,830
The One With the Football

9
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,413
To the 10, to the 5.
Touchdown, Giants!

10
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,154
You know, for once, I am gonna try
to watch one of these things.

11
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,658
Halftime.

12
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,822
Who wants to throw the ball around?
Get a little 3-on-3 going?

13
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,727
-That would be fun!
-Can I play too?

14
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,301
I've never played football, ever.

15
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,766
Great! You can cover Chandler.

16
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,302
I don't really want to play.

17
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,673
You never do anything
since you and Janice broke up.

18
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:54,743
Not true.

19
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:58,450
I wanted to wear my bathrobe
and eat peanut clusters all day.

20
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,950
And start drinking in the morning.
Don't say I don't have goals!

21
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,022
You have to start getting
over her, all right?

22
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,125
If you play, maybe it'll
take your mind off Janice.

23
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:13,924
If you don't, everyone will be mad at
you because the teams won't be even.

24
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,927
All right, I'll play.

25
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,261
Let's do it! Ross?

26
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,335
-What?
-Wanna play football?

27
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,445
Monica and I aren't supposed
to play football.

28
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,807
Says who? Your mom?

29
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,687
Every Thanksgiving, we used
to have a touch football game...

30
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,620
...called The Geller Bowl.

31
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,123
No, no, no. You say that proudly!

32
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,790
Anyway, Ross and l
were always captains.

33
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,191
It got kind of competitive,
and one year, Geller Bowl Vl...

34
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,904
... I accidentally broke Ross' nose.

35
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,302
It was so not an accident.

36
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,012
She saw I was about to tag her,
so she threw...

37
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,044
... her big fat grandma-arm
elbow in my face...

38
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,841
...and just kept running.

39
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,353
To score the winning touchdown,
by the way.

40
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,053
You did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count...

41
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:17,252
... because of the spectacularly
illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.

42
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,659
I won the game.

43
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,097
Yeah? Then how come you
didn't get the Geller Cup?

44
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,830
There was a Geller Cup?

45
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,203
Yes, the trophy you got
if you won the game.

46
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,777
But Dad said nobody won,
and he was sick of our fighting.

47
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,742
So he took the trophy...

48
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,746
...threw it in the lake.

49
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,216
And was the curse lifted?

50
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,423
Anyway...

51
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,394
... Mom said we weren't
allowed to play football again.

52
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,768
You know what?
I think we should play a game.

53
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,937
I mean, come on.
It's been 12 years.

54
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,139
Can I see you for a second?

55
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,210
Wuss!

56
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,574
All right, we're gonna play.

57
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,285
Wait. How we gonna get there?
My mom won't let me cross the street.

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,818
Here you go.

59
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,420
-Let's bring it in.
-Wait.

60
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,929
Honey, throw it to me!

61
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:27,962
Here you go.

62
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,402
That almost hit me in the face!

63
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,467
We have to pick captains.

64
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,573
And then "Tenilles."

65
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,512
So how do we decide that?

66
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,009
-Why don't we just bunny up?
-What?

67
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,444
-Bunny!
-Bunny!

68
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,152
Looks like Ross and I are captains.

69
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,981
I bunnied first,
so I get to pick first. Joey.

70
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,124
-Thank you.
-Monica!

71
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,187
I'm your best friend.

72
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,656
Sweetie, don't worry,
you'll get picked.

73
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,833
Sweetie, now I pick you.

74
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,136
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!

75
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,780
Okay. So let's see.

76
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,111
Let's play from the trash can
to the light post, right?

77
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,843
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.

78
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,717
People, listen.
I've got 28 minutes...

79
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,853
... before I have to baste again.

80
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,051
Wow, just like in the pros.

81
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,286
Okay, huddle up!

82
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,864
-Huddle up over here!
-Wait for me! Wait for me!

83
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,399
Oh, cool! My first huddle.

84
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,405
So what do you guys really think
of Chandler?

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,812
You know what you're doing, right?

86
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,406
Joey will catch it.
We'll block.

87
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,808
What's "block"?

88
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,749
-I thought you knew what you were doing.
-I thought you meant in life!

89
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,554
Break!

90
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,054
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.

91
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,898
Son of a!

92
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,367
-Come on!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

93
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,698
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.

94
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,703
I got it!

95
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,342
Go, go, go!

96
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,078
Score! Seven to nothing!

97
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:31,889
Honey, you okay?

98
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,353
Come on, let's go.

99
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,188
Losers walk.

100
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,091
Yeah? Losers talk.

101
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,390
Actually, losers rhyme.

102
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,860
Forty-three...

103
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,564
...seventy-four....

104
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,200
You wanna go shotgun?

105
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,906
-One Mississippi, two Mississippi....
-Over here! Over here!

106
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,944
I almost caught it!

107
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,614
Great. Now the score's
seven to almost seven.

108
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:09,618
On this play, I want you to do
a down-and-out to the right, okay?

109
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,659
-Break!
-Wait. What am I gonna do?

110
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:12,796
You?

111
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,321
You go long.

112
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,591
How long?

113
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,063
Until we start to look very small.

114
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:19,937
Break!

115
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,971
One Mississippi

116
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,800
Switch! Switch! Switch!

117
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,088
Thanks for stopping our ball.

118
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,189
You are playing American football?

119
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,590
Wow! You're, like,
from a whole other country!

120
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,298
I'm Dutch.

121
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,863
Hi, I'm Joey.

122
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,159
I am Margha.

123
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,803
Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get
that last little bit.

124
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,767
You wanna play football or
Hi, I'm Chandler.

125
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,773
Hello, Chandler.

126
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,878
Her name is Dutch and also "Margham."

127
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,714
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Second down!

128
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,718
-Hello? It's third down.
-No, it's not. It's second.

129
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,493
Wow.

130
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,856
"Wow" what?

131
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,068
How it just amazes me that you're
still pulling stuff like this.

132
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,406
-Pulling what? It's second down.
-Okay, it's second down.

133
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,003
Take all the second downs you need.

134
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,506
-I heard that.
-Well, I said it loud.

135
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,474
It is okay if I stay and watch?

136
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,686
-Just sit right there.
-Yeah, why don't you stick around?

137
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,548
-That went well.
-I think so.

138
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,724
I was thinking about asking her
for her number.

139
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:51,726
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger
statement if I ask for it myself.

140
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:57,832
I was thinking about for me, as part
of that getting-over-Janice thing.

141
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,698
Oh, yeah. That.

142
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,766
If it means that much,
I'll let you have her.

143
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,101
Thanks.

144
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,101
"Let me have her"?

145
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,508
You mean if you didn't,
I wouldn't have a shot?

146
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,542
I don't like to say it out loud...

147
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,278
... but yeah!

148
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,118
We all have our strengths.
You're better with numbers and stuff.

149
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,522
Math? You're giving me math?

150
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,924
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.

151
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,633
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.

152
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,872
I want you to run a post-pattern
to the left. And, sweetie

153
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,303
Yeah, I know. Go long.

154
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,206
All I'm doing is running
back and forth from the huddle.

155
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,045
Well, you wanna just stay out there?

156
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,114
Can I see that for a second?

157
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,484
Okay, let's go.

158
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,955
-I got Chandler!
-Hike!

159
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,129
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

160
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,594
Fumble!

161
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,598
What's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.

162
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,766
Well, now you have two.

163
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,646
Hey, I am good at math!

164
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,142
That's it. I was still
gonna let you have her.

165
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,648
But now, prepare to feel
bad about yourself.

166
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,254
I've been preparing for that
my entire life!

167
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,155
Or something about you that's mean!

168
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,457
Come on, guys. Let's go.

169
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,527
Tie score.
We're running out of time.

170
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,092
Forty-two, 38, hike!

171
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,325
I got it!

172
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,429
Broken boobs!

173
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,671
-Pheebs, run!
-Run, Phoebe, run!

174
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,372
Touchdown! Touchdown!

175
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,776
The buzzer buzzed.
It doesn't count.

176
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,879
-After the snap.
-Before the snap.

177
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,380
-After.
-Before.

178
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,350
-Does it really matter?
-Yes!

179
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,150
But I made a touchdown.
It was my first touchdown.

180
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,794
Pheebs, that's great.
Doesn't count.

181
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,963
-Does so count.
-Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

182
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,166
Oh, my God!

183
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,535
That's fine. Maybe you haven't
grown up, but I have.

184
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,370
Dead leg!

185
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,080
Okay, fine. You want to win
by cheating, go ahead.

186
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,340
The touchdown does count.
You win.

187
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,815
I won't do this again. I wanna
beat you when you can't blame it...

188
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,654
...on the broken nose or the buzzer
or the fact that you might have mono.

189
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,256
Let's just call this tie score
and it's halftime.

190
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,932
First, I don't play with cheaters.

191
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,194
Second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!

192
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,503
You know what? I think you'll play.

193
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,937
Oh, really? Why's that?

194
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,941
Because the winner gets this.

195
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,742
The Geller Cup!

196
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,211
Is everybody else seeing a
troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?

197
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,581
Okay, good.

198
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,461
Where the hell did you get that?

199
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,963
When you went to the hospital
for your nose...

200
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,066
...I swam into the lake
and fished it out.

201
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,238
That cup is mine!

202
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,704
No, it's not. You want it,
you're gonna have to win it.

203
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,571
So are we not
having dinner at all?

204
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,208
Come on, let's go.
It's time to get serious. Huddle up.

205
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,682
IKeep your head in the game.

206
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,389
It's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.

207
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,225
If I take Chandler out of the running,
will you be able to focus?

208
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,396
-What are you gonna do?
-Just make sure he catches the ball.

209
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,631
I'll do the rest.

210
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,466
-Come on, you wuss!
-Okay, come on.

211
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,402
I got it!

212
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,731
Come on! This way!
Come on!

213
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,037
Look out!

214
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,338
Tackled by a girl!
Bet you don't see that every day.

215
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,050
What's with the tackling?

216
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,542
What?

217
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,919
I just touched him and he went over.

218
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,091
Okay. You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.

219
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,262
Let's get ready to rumble!

220
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,298
-Go, go, go!
-Get her! Get her!

221
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,039
I love this game!

222
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,275
Where'd you get that?

223
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,913
I went really long.

224
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,083
Forty-two to 21.

225
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,813
Like the turkey, Ross is done!

226
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,589
You got to pick
first, so you got the better team.

227
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,765
Pathetic! Why can't you
just accept that we're winning...

228
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,296
... because I'm better than you?

229
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,334
Oh, what a great argument.
Exhaling!

230
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,835
All right, I'll prove it to you.

231
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,843
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel
and I'll still win the game.

232
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,341
What? The guys against the girls?

233
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,106
That's ridiculous because
I'm only down by three touchdowns.

234
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,012
Then bring it on!

235
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,518
Unless you're afraid you might lose
to a bunch of girls.

236
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:56,159
Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.

237
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,328
I can't believe you're trading me.

238
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,760
Let's see what it's like
to be on a winning team for a change.

239
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,662
You're gonna let me play?

240
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,263
All right, then!

241
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,200
The game is over? We eat now?

242
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,305
The game's not over.
We're switching teams.

243
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,843
Chandler finds me so intimidating that
it's better if we're on the same team.

244
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,008
Okay, let's play.
Let's go.

245
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,682
Hold on a second.

246
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,446
Where do Dutch people come from?

247
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,056
Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch
come from Pennsylvania.

248
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,858
And the other Dutch people?

249
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,730
They come from somewhere near
the Netherlands, right?

250
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,869
Nice try.

251
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,236
The Netherlands is this
make-believe place...

252
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,341
...where Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell live.

253
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,978
Oh, my.

254
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,182
Enough "geography for the insane."
Let's play ball.

255
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,547
I'm not playing with this guy.

256
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,217
-Fine with me.
-I've had enough of this.

257
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:03,427
Let's just cut to the chase.
Heidi, which of my boys do you like?

258
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,385
What are you doing?

259
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,892
What are you doing?

260
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,428
Which do I like?

261
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,332
Yeah, for dating, general merriment,
taking back to your windmill?

262
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,498
Well, if I had to choose right now...

263
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,507
...which, by the way,
I find really weird...

264
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,939
... I would have to say Chandler.

265
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,851
Wait a minute.
She didn't understand the question.

266
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:33,285
Why don't you have Captain Hook
explain it to her?

267
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,593
I'm sorry. That is my truth.

268
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,389
You hear that? That is her truth,
Mr. "I'll Let You Have Her"!

269
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,294
I win! You suck! I rule all!

270
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,628
Mini-wave in celebration of me!

271
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:55,105
I am now thinking I would like
to change my answer to "no one."

272
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,739
What?

273
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,049
I now find you shallow...

274
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,877
...and a dork.

275
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,712
Bye-bye.

276
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,221
Nice going.

277
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,992
You just saved yourself
a couple months of sex.

278
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,295
It doesn't matter,
because she picked me.

279
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,295
From now on,
I get the dates...

280
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,297
...and you stay home on Saturday
nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!

281
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,601
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.

282
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,570
We have no time and we are
losing to girls.

283
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,301
We're not gonna lose to girls.

284
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,943
It's 42-21!

285
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,308
This sucks!
I was just up by that much!

286
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,276
Are we playing football or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!

287
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,183
We have to do this.
We're playing for women everywhere.

288
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,987
Think about every lousy date
you ever had.

289
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,026
Every guy who kept one eye
on the TV while you were making out.

290
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,496
Oh, my God. You dated someone
with a glass eye too?

291
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,301
Come on, okay? This is for
all womankind. Let's kill them!

292
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,941
Yeah! IKill them!

293
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,709
All right,
I want to kill them too.

294
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,345
But they're boys.

295
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,979
You know, how are we gonna
beat three boys?

296
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,514
A minute and a half left
and we're down by two points.

297
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,980
Two points, ladies.

298
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,655
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

299
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,225
Rachel, you go long.

300
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,159
No, don't make me go long.
Use me. They never cover me.

301
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,094
Honey, there's a reason.

302
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,098
I'm not lame, okay?
I can do something.

303
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,840
Would you let me throw?
This is my game too.

304
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,702
Let her throw the ball.

305
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,539
Sweep behind, I'll pitch it.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.

306
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,769
Thank you.

307
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:10,947
-Break!
-Break!

308
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,180
All right, here we go.

309
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,682
Thirty-two, 71, hike!

310
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,514
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi!

311
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,286
Go, go, go!

312
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,463
Catch it!

313
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,727
-I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay!

314
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,540
They were coming at me
and I didn't know what to do.

315
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,743
Thirty seconds left on the timer.

316
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,036
So we get to take that
stupid troll thing home.

317
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,216
Come on! Hurry!
We're running out of time.

318
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,941
Huddle up!

319
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,422
This is our last huddle!

320
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,225
All right, Phoebe, get open.
Rachel...

321
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,290
...go long.

322
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,893
Okay.

323
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,154
Break!

324
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,877
I did it! Touchdown!
We did it!

325
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,786
You know? Funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.

326
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,991
So you're five feet short.
So...

327
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,117
...we win!

328
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,561
Yes, yes, yes!

329
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,856
Wait, explain something, though.

330
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,331
If nobody tagged Rachel,
then isn't the play still going?

331
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,043
-Let me in, let me in!
-No way! Let go!

332
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,906
Let go?! I'm a tiny little woman!

333
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,479
Come on, it's Thanksgiving!

334
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,015
It's not important who wins or loses.

335
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,313
The important thing
is the Dutch girl picked me!

336
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:37,527
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

337
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,561
We should play football
more often.

338
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,330
Maybe there's a league
we could join.

339
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,544
Isn't there a
"national football league"?

340
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,213
Yes, there is. They play on
Sundays and Monday nights.

341
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,940
Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.

342
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:06,554
This stuffing is amazing. Do you
think we should bring them some?

343
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,783
When they're hungry,
they'll come in.

344
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,894
-Let go!
-No, you let go!

345
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,800
How come it's always us
left holding the ball?

346
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,936
I don't know. I guess the other
people just don't care enough.

347
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,478
Hey, it's starting to snow.

348
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,913
-Give it to me! Let go!
-Let it go! Come on, let go!
