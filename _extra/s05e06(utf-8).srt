1
00:00:05 --> 00:00:09
None of that.Not while you're under my roof!

2
00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
Just because I know about youdoesn't mean I like looking at it.

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
Aren't you supposed to beat an audition?

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
I'm sorry I'm nota middle-aged black woman.

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
I'm also sorry if sometimesI go to the wrong audition.

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
If I pretend to not know about you...

7
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
...then you pretendthere's nothing to know.

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
Sorry.

9
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
I can hear that!

10
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
Rachel's at work.

11
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
I can still hear you!

12
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
The One with the Yeti

13
00:01:26 --> 00:01:27
What's that?

14
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
My mom sent me an heirloomthat belonged to my grandmother.

15
00:01:30 --> 00:01:31
Can you believe it?

16
00:01:31 --> 00:01:36
A year ago I had no family,and now I have heirlooms!

17
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
Oh, God!

18
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
Soft.

19
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
Is this mink?

20
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
Why would my mother send me a fur?Doesn't she know me but at all?

21
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
I have a fine coat that no innocentanimals suffered to make.

22
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
Just Filipino kids who workedtheir fingers bloody...

23
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
...for 12 cents an hour.

24
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
I made that up.

25
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
You can't put up flyers in here.

26
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
How come?Everybody else does.

27
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
You can't.

28
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
What is that?

29
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
I'm getting rid of some things.

30
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
This is all of your things.

31
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
Yes, it is.

32
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
It's good. Emily thinkswe should get all new stuff.

33
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
Stuff that's just ours.Together. Brand new.

34
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
So it's a get-rid-of-anything-Rachel-ever-touched sale.

35
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
Touched, used, sat on, slept on...

36
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
I'll take it all.

37
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
You're okay with that?

38
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
If I can just do what Emily wants...

39
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
...and get her to New York,it will be fine.

40
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
Isn't that a little extreme?

41
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
After what I did, can you blame her?

42
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
You got off easy.

43
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
When my friend's husband saidanother name in bed...

44
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
...she cursed himand turned his thingy green.

45
00:03:00 --> 00:03:01
What is he doing?

46
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
Emily thinks Ross' furniturehas got Rachel cooties?

47
00:03:05 --> 00:03:06
Calm down, Joey.

48
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
Everything's getting all messed up!

49
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

50
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
We won't stop seeing Rachel.

51
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
Hence, Ross stops seeing us.

52
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
I hate this.Everything's changing.

53
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
We're losing Ross.Joey said "hence".

54
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
I'm not happy about this either,but if Ross says he's happy...

55
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
...then we have to keepour feelings to ourselves.

56
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
Are you cool with that?

57
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
But, you know, I'm an actor.

58
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
I'll act cool.

59
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
Storage rooms give me the creeps.

60
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
Please hurry up, honey.

61
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
If you want little round waffles,wait till I find the iron.

62
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
I want the little round waffles.

63
00:03:52 --> 00:03:53
Here it is!

64
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

65
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
Is the best place to put somethingthat cooks food underneath poison?

66
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
You know what?I'll have toast.

67
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
Fog him! Fog him!

68
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
I don't know what to doabout this coat.

69
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
I'll take it.

70
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
That might work.

71
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
What do you think?

72
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.

73
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
No, it's just a bit sudden.

74
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
It's great, okay?I am totally on board.

75
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
I love you too.All right, bye.

76
00:04:37 --> 00:04:38
What's the matter?

77
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Nothing. No, actually...

78
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
...great news!

79
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
I just spoke with Emily...

80
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
...and looks like I'm movingto a new apartment.

81
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
Why?

82
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
Her thought is, and I agree...

83
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
...fresh new furniture,why not a fresh new apartment?

84
00:04:55 --> 00:04:56
Her cousin has a place to sublet.

85
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
It's got a viewof the river and Columbia.

86
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
That's way uptown!That's three trains away...

87
00:05:01 --> 00:05:02
...which is great!

88
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
I love to ride that rail.

89
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
You're okay with this?

90
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
It's kind of far from work...

91
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
...but I'll get so much doneon the commute.

92
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
I've been given the gift of time.

93
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
That's so funny. Last ChristmasI got the gift of space.

94
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
We should get them togetherand make a continuum.

95
00:05:25 --> 00:05:26
Now he's moving?

96
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
Man, what is Emily doing to him?

97
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
He's not even here!

98
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
You guys!

99
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
We were in the storage area,and we saw this creepy man.

100
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
It was this crazy-eyed,hairy beast-man.

101
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
It was like a Big Footor a yeti or something.

102
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
He came at us,so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.

103
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
I pulled the taband I just fogged his yeti ass.

104
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
Like, dark hair, bushy beard?

105
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
Yeah, you fogged Danny.

106
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
Please! We did not fog Danny.

107
00:05:58 --> 00:05:59
Who's Danny?

108
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
Danny just moved in.

109
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
He just got back from a four-monthtrek in the Andes. Nice fella.

110
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
He's nice.You know, you always...

111
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
...stick up for the people we fog.

112
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
You might not remember us,but we're the girls that fogged you.

113
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
We're really sorry we fogged you.

114
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
Just so you know,we didn't mean to fog you.

115
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
We thought you werelike a yeti or something.

116
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
Sorry to bother you, but we can'taccept your acceptance of our apology.

117
00:06:47 --> 00:06:51
It doesn't really seemlike you mean it.

118
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
That guy is so rude!

119
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
Really!What is with that guy?

120
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
You'd forgive me if I fogged you?

121
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
You did, a little bit.

122
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Oh, my God, honey.I'm so sorry.

123
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
- I totally forgive you.- Really?

124
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
You know my friend Chriswho owns the crematorium?

125
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
Crematorium Chris? Sure.

126
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
He said he would crematemy fur coat for free...

127
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
...if I bring in the next personI know who dies.

128
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
Oh, my God.Look at these pelts!

129
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
Don't get too attached.She's having it cremated.

130
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
You're quirky, and I get a big kickout of it. We all do.

131
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
But if you destroya coat like this...

132
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
...that is like a crimeagainst nature.

133
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
Not nature. Fashion!

134
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
This is fashion?

135
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
So to you, death is fashion?

136
00:07:50 --> 00:07:50
That's funny.

137
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
Here's Phoebe...

138
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
...sporting cutting edgehairy carcass...

139
00:07:55 --> 00:08:00
...from, you know, the steel trapsof wintry Russia.

140
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
You really think this looks good?

141
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
Because I do!

142
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
I miss you too.I can't wait to see you.

143
00:08:11 --> 00:08:12
I love you. Bye.

144
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
What is in here, rocks?

145
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
No, it's my collectionof fossil samples.

146
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
So, rocks.

147
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
I'll miss this apartment.

148
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
You know, Ben took his first stepsright over there.

149
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
Remember when I ran into thisand it knocked me out?

150
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
I love this place.

151
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
To tell the truth,I wish I didn't have to move.

152
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
Are you saying that you're notentirely happy about this?

153
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
If Emily gave me a choice...

154
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
You do have a choice!

155
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
Why are you listening to her?Are you crazy?

156
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
It's not right what Emily wantsyou to do. She's totally...

157
00:08:56 --> 00:08:57
Stop pinching me!

158
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
You guys said to keep my mouth shutif Ross was happy, right?

159
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
He just told methat he's not entirely happy.

160
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
What's going on?

161
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
We all hate Emily!

162
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.

163
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
We just think thatyou're having to sacrifice...

164
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
...a whole lot to make her happy.

165
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
We just think that maybeshe's being a little unreasonable.

166
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
Yes, unreasonable.

167
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
Unreasonable?

168
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
How about we have this conversationwhen one of you marries?

169
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
You have no idea what it takesto make a marriage work.

170
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
It's compromise.Do you always like it? No.

171
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
Do you do it? Yes.

172
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
Because it's not all laughing,happy, candy in the sky...

173
00:09:39 --> 00:09:40
...coffee at Central Perk.

174
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
It's real life, okay?

175
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
It's what grownups do.

176
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
I think he's right.

177
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
You guys hang out atthe coffeehouse way too much.

178
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
- I feel so guilty about Ross.- I know.

179
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
I kind of feel like it's my fault.

180
00:10:06 --> 00:10:07
Kind of?

181
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
You should have kept this to yourself.

182
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
I'm keeping so many things to myself,something was bound to slip out!

183
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
I think it's very bravewhat you said.

184
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
I can't sit here any more.I have to walk places.

185
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
What's with the coat?How about the animal rights thing?

186
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
I've been reading up,and for your information...

187
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
...minks aren't very nice.

188
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Okay, I admit it.I love this coat, okay?

189
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
It's the best thing I ever had wrappedaround me, including Phil Huntley.

190
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
Remember Phil Huntley?He was fine.

191
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
So you like the short hair better?

192
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
Yeti? Danny?

193
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
I had to cut my hair to get rid of...

194
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
...the fogger smell.

195
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
Listen, I'm so sorry.I would have never fogged you...

196
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
...if you hadn't looked so...

197
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
Absolutely. Some peopleare just into appearances.

198
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
What?

199
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
It's cool.

200
00:11:16 --> 00:11:17
No, that is not cool.

201
00:11:17 --> 00:11:18
You don't even know me.

202
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
You got the shopping bagsand the Saks catalogue.

203
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
From that, you've got meall figured out?

204
00:11:25 --> 00:11:25
Well, you don't.

205
00:11:26 --> 00:11:30
You know, I could have toysfor underprivileged kids in here.

206
00:11:30 --> 00:11:31
Do you?

207
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
You know, if kids like to playwith capri pants.

208
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
Stop saying that.I hate that!

209
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
I judged you.I made a snap judgment.

210
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
But you did it too, and you're worse.You're sticking to your judgement.

211
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
You can't even open your mind to seeyou might be wrong.

212
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
What does that say about you?

213
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
That pizza placeacross the street any good?

214
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
I'm hungry.You want some pizza?

215
00:12:04 --> 00:12:07
You can keep yelling.

216
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
Stop saying that.I hate that.

217
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
Are you still mad?

218
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
Good! We have an "I'm Sorry" song.

219
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
You know what?I'm not in the mood.

220
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
Look, Ross.

221
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
I feel really bad.You're going through all this stuff...

222
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
...and I just acted like a jerk.

223
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
- We are so sorry.- You're stepping on the song.

224
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
We were way out of line, all right?We totally support you.

225
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
Whatever you decide,whatever you do.

226
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
Now you're just taking linesout of the song.

227
00:12:41 --> 00:12:45
This is hard enough, okay?I really need you guys right now.

228
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
Yes, exactly! And that's why...

229
00:12:48 --> 00:12:53
Why don't you come over tonight,and I'll make your favorite dinner.

230
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
Thanks, you guys.

231
00:12:57 --> 00:12:58
Are you wearing fur?

232
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
Let's get some perspective, people.

233
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
It's not like I'm wearinga seeing-eye dog coat!

234
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
You know, I think I kind ofunderstand why I lost it today.

235
00:13:10 --> 00:13:11
You do, huh?

236
00:13:11 --> 00:13:12
You see...

237
00:13:12 --> 00:13:13
...I'm an actor, right?

238
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
So I got to keep my emotionsright at the surface.

239
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
I got a lot of balls in the air,you know?

240
00:13:21 --> 00:13:26
It's tough. Guys like me,you wander around, you're alone.

241
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
What are you talking about?

242
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
I'm not sure.

243
00:13:32 --> 00:13:33
Look at you!Where have you been?

244
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
I went to have pizza.

245
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
With Danny.

246
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
What happened?

247
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
That yeti is one smooth talker.

248
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
I hope you're not full.Dinner's almost ready.

249
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
I think I'll probablyjust hang out in my room.

250
00:13:46 --> 00:13:46
Why?

251
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
Come on, you guys!

252
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
If Emily knew I was having dinnerwith you, she'd flip out.

253
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
It's okay.I really don't mind.

254
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
Wait, wait. You know what?Just stay.

255
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
Please.

256
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
It would mean a lot for meif you stay.

257
00:14:03 --> 00:14:03
Ross, I just...

258
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
Please, just have dinner with us!

259
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
Settle down.

260
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
All right. I'm sorry.

261
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.

262
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
Hey, look!Ugly naked guy's back.

263
00:14:21 --> 00:14:22
We haven't seen him in so long.

264
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
Oh, God! I really missedthat fat bastard.

265
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
This is so weird.

266
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
I realized this may bethe last time we hang out together.

267
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
It's almost as if he knew.

268
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
I'll get it.

269
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
Hi, Emily.

270
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
You tracked him down.Hold on.

271
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
Yeah, we're just having dinner.

272
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
Sure, hold on.

273
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
She wants to say hi.

274
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
Hi, Emily!

275
00:15:00 --> 00:15:01
Hello, everyone.

276
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
So who am I saying hello to?

277
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
Well, I don't knowabout who's here...

278
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
...but I can tell you who's not here,and that's Rachel!

279
00:15:10 --> 00:15:15
Ross knows better than that by now.

280
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
You know what?Rachel is here.

281
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
She's there?

282
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
Oh, yeah, there she is!

283
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
She's here.

284
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Take me off speakerphone.

285
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
How could you do this to me?

286
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
I made my feelings about Rachelperfectly clear.

287
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
I'm just having dinnerwith my friends, okay?

288
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
- That's ridiculous.

289
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
I'm moving for you. I'm cuttingfriends out of my life for you.

290
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
Please, get on the planeand come to New York, okay?

291
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
I want to be with.

292
00:15:48 --> 00:15:53
I'll feel better when I'm there.I can know where you are all the time.

293
00:15:54 --> 00:15:57
You can't know where I amall the time.

294
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
This marriage will never workif you don't trust me.

295
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
You're right.

296
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
Can you trust me?

297
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
I think it's going okay.

298
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
Looks like he's smiling.

299
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
How can you tell?You can only see his back.

300
00:16:21 --> 00:16:22
You can totally tell!

301
00:16:23 --> 00:16:24
Here, look, watch me.

302
00:16:25 --> 00:16:25
Smile.

303
00:16:26 --> 00:16:27
Frown. Smile.

304
00:16:27 --> 00:16:28
Frown.

305
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
Smile.

306
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
I guess that's it.

307
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
Why? What happened?

308
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
My marriage is over.

309
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
Look at you, you're shivering.

310
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
Here.

311
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
Honey, is there anything we can do?

312
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
You can help meget my furniture back from Gunther.

313
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
Stop tormenting me!

314
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
This is mink, okay? They're mean,and they hate squirrels.

315
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
Most of these probablywanted to be coats.

316
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
Fine. No, I get it.

317
00:17:32 --> 00:17:33
Here.

318
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
You take it.

319
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
Are you happy now?I'm cold!
