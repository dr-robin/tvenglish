I was supposed to call my dad back[br]two hours ago.

23

Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

Call him as soon as you get a chance.[br]He's at Flimbees.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

29

What's Flimbees?

31

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

32

That's the word I use when[br]I can't remember the real thing.

33



34

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

35

Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

36



37

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

38

No. That's what they want me to do.

39

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

41

My warranty expires tomorrow.[br]If I don't get through. . .

42



43

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

44

. . .they won't fix my crappy,[br]broken phone for free!

45



46

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

47

We cannot let them win![br]It's us versus them!

48



49

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

50

Yes!

51



52

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

53

I gotta double-check for tickets[br]tonight. Who got what?

54



55

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

56

I have one.

57

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

65

I have a boyfriend now.

66



67

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

68

Two it is. How about you?

69



70

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

71

Yeah, I also need two.

72



73

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

74

Really? Who's number two?

75



76

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

77

Whose Number Two? One of the more[br]difficult games sewer workers play.

78



79

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

80

No, it's just this person.

81



82

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

83

Like a date-type person?

84



85

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

86

Yeah, kind of.[br]It's this woman from work.

87



88

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

89

I hope that won't be too weird.[br]Will it, Rach?

90



91

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

92

Not at all. I was actually[br]gonna bring someone myself.

93



94

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

95

But you said one ticket.

96



97

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

98

I meant me plus one.

99



100

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

101

Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

102



103

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

104

All right. I'll see you tonight.

107

Okay. Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.

Oh, hey! You guys are finally[br]gonna get to meet Kate!

122

What are you doing?[br]She's seeing somebody.

123



124

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

125

Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

138



139

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

140

I'm setting the phone down.

141



142

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

143

But I'm still here.

144



145

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

146

Just don't go anywhere.[br]I'm still here.

147



148

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

149

Don't switch or anything, because[br]I'm right here. Just one sec.

150



151

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

152

One sec. One second!

153

155

Wait! One second! Just. . . .

156



157

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

158

What? Monica, I'm scared!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

161

Honey, that's a sleeve.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

164

And we also have a speakerphone.

165



166

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is important to us.

170

You gotta hang up.[br]We'll be late.

171



172

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

173

Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

174



175

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

176

Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

177



178

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

179

You were gonna have me hang up.

180



181

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

182

Can you take a duck and a chick[br]to the theater?

183



184

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

185

Of course not.

186



187

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

188

I just wanted them to hear it[br]from somebody else.

189



190

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

191

Oh, hi, how are you?

192



193

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

194

Good.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

197

-Looks like we're the first ones here.[br]-Looks that way.

198



199

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

200

First ones here!

201



202

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

203

Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.[br]Ross, Tommy.

204



205

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

206

Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin.[br]Cailin--

207



208

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

209

Sorry.

210



211

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

212

And break!

213



214

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

215

I think I'm gonna run[br]to the ladies' room.

216



217

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

218

-I'll join you.[br]-I'll get our seats.

219



220

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

221

Well, this is. . .

222



223

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

224

. . .awkward.

225



226

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

227

Well, because Rachel and I[br]used to go out.

228



229

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

230

Oh, I didn't know that.

231



232

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

233

Well, then this is awkward.

234



235

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

236

-So what do you. . .?[br]-I think we're here.

237



238

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

239

Excuse me. I'm sorry.

240



241

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

242

I think you may be in our seats.

243



244

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

245

No, I don't think so.

246



247

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

248

-Could we take a look at your ticket?[br]-Sure.

249



250

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

251

Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" . . . .

252



253

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

254

Oh, well, I thought that--

255



256

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

257

You thought? Well, that didn't[br]really work out for you. Idiot!

258



259

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

260

What are you, a moron?[br]It says, "D-1 3" ! Okay?

261



262

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

263

You're surrounded by even numbers![br]Does that give you a clue?

264



265

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

266

-The usher told me--[br]-The usher must be right!

267



268

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

269

With all his training!

270



271

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

272

Get out!

273



274

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

275

Here!

276



277

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

278

-Hey, man, you want the aisle?[br]-No, I'm good.

279



280

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

281

-There he is![br]-There's our star!

282



283

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

284

You were great!

285



286

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

287

So? What'd you think?

288



289

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

290

Almost as good as the play with[br]the two naked girls on the seesaw.

291



292

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

293

-I wasn't in that.[br]-I know.

294



295

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

296

I want you to meet everybody.[br]Everybody, this is Kate.

297



298

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

299

Excuse me. Excuse me.[br]Sweetheart!

300



301

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

302

Come!

303



304

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

305

So that's the girl you like.

306



307

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

308

I tell you, this guy[br]Rachel is with is crazy.

309



310

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

311

He viciously screamed at total[br]strangers. I think he's bad news.

312



313

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

314

Wait a minute. You don't like[br]the guy Rachel's dating?

315



316

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

317

Well, that's odd.

318



319

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

320

Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is[br]Kate's understudy, Lauren.

321



322

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

323

Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

324



325

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

326

I ran into you in the hallway[br]in your building.

327



328

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

329

It was right after I slept with Joey.[br]He dumped me the next day.

330



331

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

332

So how'd you guys meet?

333



334

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

335

The short version is, I pursued[br]her for a couple of months.

336



337

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

338

Then I gave her a check for $20,000[br]and she was mine.

339



340

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

341

In the long version, I dump him[br]for telling people the short version.

342



343

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

344

Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

345



346

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

347

You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

348



349

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

350

How do you do?

351



352

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

353

Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

354



355

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

356

Do they have representation?

357



358

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

359

They weren't in the play.

360



361

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

362

We're not actors.

363



364

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

365

What a shame!

366



367

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

368

With her face and her chest,[br]I could really put something together.

369



370

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

371

Could I borrow it?

372



373

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

374

Hi. Remember me?

375



376

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

377

Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line[br]for the bathroom. . .

378



379

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

380

. . .and someone just cut.[br]I think he's gonna snap.

381



382

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

383

I'm gonna go.

384



385

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

386

Go? Why?

387



388

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

389

I don't know. Could be[br]because I don't feel like. . .

390



391

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

392

. . .waiting all night for a guy[br]who may or may not scream.

393



394

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

395

He definitely will scream.

396



397

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

398

Goodbye.

399



400

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

442

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

443

Does anyone mind if I save this?

444



445

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

446

-Is the play over?[br]-Where were you?

447



448

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

449

Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

450



451

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

452

You were "the next caller" hours ago.[br]You must be going crazy.

453



454

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

455

I've kept myself busy.

456



457

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

458

Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in[br]her room and her stuff in your room.

459



460

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

461

You okay?

462



463

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

464

Fabulous.

465



466

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

467

Drama critics, they're nothing but[br]people who couldn't make it as actors.

468



469

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

470

-You know what to do?[br]-Become a drama critic.

471



472

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

473

I am hurt!

474



475

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

476

A plague. . .

477



478

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

479

. . .on both your houses!

480



481

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

482

By the way, he dumped me tonight[br]after he read my review.

483



484

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

485

Oh, classy.

486



487

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

488

I sure know how to pick them.

489



490

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

491

You know I gave up a part[br]on a soap for this?

492



493

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

494

I gave up a job too.

495



496

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

497

-Really? What?[br]-Declawing cats.

498



499

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

500

Hey, tell you what,[br]let me walk you home.

501



502

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

503

We'll stop by every newsstand and burn[br]every copy of The Times and The Post.

504



505

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

506

-Why The Post?[br]-You didn't see The Post?

507



508

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

509

-No. You?[br]-No. Why?

510



511

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

512

You really think these newspapers[br]are just jealous of me?

513



514

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

515

Absolutely. You're talented[br]and you're good-looking.

516



517

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

518

You're sweet and cute.

519



520

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

521

I know. That's why they trashed me.

522



523

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

524

-Wait. Wait a minute.[br]-What?

525



526

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

527

I don't get you.

528



529

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

530

I mean, first you hate me.

531



532

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

533

Then you sleep with me.

534



535

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

536

Then you want nothing to do with me.[br]Now you want me again?

537



538

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

539

You never went out[br]with an actress before?

540



541

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

542

Kate, do you even like me?

543



544

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

545

-Of course I do.[br]-So how come you blew me off?

546



547

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

548

-How come you were with him?[br]-I don't know.

549



550

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

551

I just do this.

552



553

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

554

I always have to pick, like,[br]the smartest guy. . .

555



556

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

557

. . .or the most talented guy.

558



559

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

560

Why can't I just[br]pick someone like you?

561



562

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

563

Thanks.

564



565

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

566

You know what I mean.

567



568

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

569

I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

570



571

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

572

You're just so. . . .

573



574

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

575

You're so. . .

576



577

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

578

: : :so: : : :

579



580

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

581

Here we go.[br]Let's get your feet up there.

582



583

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

584

Good night.

585



586

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

587

Sweet dreams.

588



589

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

590

I'm gonna put this can right here[br]in case you have to hurl.

591



592

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

593

Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is very important to us.

594



595

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

596

You've been up for 24 hours.[br]Go to sleep.

597



598

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

599

This isn't healthy.

600



601

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

602

No, no, I'm fine.

603



604

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

605

And you know why?[br]Because of all the riboflavin.

606



607

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

608

Didn't you have that on last night?

609



610

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

611

I stayed at Kate's[br]but nothing happened.

612



613

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

614

Hey, where were you?

615



616

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

617

I'm so, so sorry.[br]I am definitely gonna see your play.

618



619

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

620

I swear, your play is very important[br]to us. Thank you for your patience.

621



622

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

623

Your play is the next play[br]I'm gonna see.

624



625

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

626

How'd it go with Kate?

627



628

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

629

It was great!

630



631

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

632

I walked her home, and it was[br]amazing how much we connected.

633



634

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

635

Then she passed out.

636



637

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

638

But then she woke up.

639



640

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

641

And we stayed up all night talking.

642



643

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

644

And now we're crazy about each other!

645



646

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

647

You had "the night" !

648



649

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

650

When two people realize[br]their feelings for each other. . .

651



652

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

653

. . .and they talk for hours and learn[br]all about the other person.

654



655

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

656

You think?

657



658

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

659

-Did you learn about her family?[br]-Two brothers. One died!

660



661

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

662

Yes!

663



664

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

665

This is from the woman at the bar.

666



667

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

668

Sorry. She thought[br]you were somebody else.

669



670

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

671

-What time is it?[br]-One.

672



673

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

674

7: 1 5.

675



676

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

677

Watch doesn't work.

678



679

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

680

Tommy's supposed to be here soon.[br]We're going to lunch.

681



682

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

683

Look, I wasn't gonna[br]say anything to you, but. . . .

684



685

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

686

All right, I don't think[br]you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

687



688

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

689

You don't?

690



691

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

692

The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.[br]I think you should stay away from him.

693



694

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

695

Or maybe I should stay away[br]from all men.

696



697

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

698

It's not just because I'm jealous.

699



700

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

701

I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

702



703

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

704

Look, the guy actually screamed[br]at this couple sitting in our seats.

705



706

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

707

Yeah, and at the end of the play. . .

708



709

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

710

. . .he got up, and he just started,[br]like, banging his hands together.

711



712

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

713

You don't want to believe me,[br]that's fine.

714



715

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

716

We're kidding.

717



718

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

719

No one believe me.[br]I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

720



721

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

722

-Sorry, Tommy.[br]-What's in the cup?

723



724

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

725

What is in the cup?

726



727

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

728

Okay, it's coffee.

729



730

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

731

Iced coffee?[br]Tell me it's iced coffee.

732



733

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

734

-It's hot--[br]-Hot coffee!

735



736

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

737

You idiot! You gonna spill[br]hot coffee all over me, huh?

738



739

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

740

What are you? Just a big, stupid[br]doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

741



742

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

743

What's your favorite thing[br]about summertime?

744



745

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

746

Going to the beach[br]when it stays light real late.

747



748

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

749

What's your favorite thing[br]about summer?

750



751

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

752

I don't know. Probably the smell[br]of freshly cut grass.

753



754

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

755

That's a good one.

756



757

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

758

Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and[br]my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

759



760

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

761

We held the curtain for you.[br]Let's go!

762



763

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

764

vic! Where have you been, baby?

765



766

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

767

Where's Kate?

768



769

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

770

She got a job in L.A.

771



772

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

773

I've been waiting up all night[br]for you. Where have you been?

774



775

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

776

Where have you been, vic?

777



778

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

779

Go to the window. I wanna run down[br]to the truck and show you something.

780



781

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

782

What do you got down there, vic?

783



784

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

785

What do you got under that tarp?

786



787

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

788

When is she leaving?

789



790

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

791

Tonight. What are you doing?

792



793

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

794

I'm coming up!

795



796

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

797

Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

798



799

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

800

Use ours across the hall[br]because she. . .

801



802

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

803

. . .has problems.

804



805

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

806

Thanks.

807



808

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

809

Sorry, Tommy.

810



811

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

812

I almost spilled this[br]hot coffee on you.

813



814

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

815

Yeah, but you didn't.

816



817

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

818

No, but. . .

819



820

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

821

. . .it's hot.

822



823

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

824

Would you stop it?[br]It's getting really old.

825



826

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

827

I can't believe no one believes me.

828



829

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

830

I do. I believe you.

831



832

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

833

You do?

834



835

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

836

Yeah. But I also believed her[br]when she said I was next.

837



838

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

839

Hey there, little fella.

840



841

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

842

Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

843



844

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

845

Gross!

846



847

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

848

Idiot!

849



850

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

851

Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

852



853

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

854

"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute![br]I'm a little chick who's disgusting! "

855



856

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

857

You're so stupid![br]How are you not yet extinct?

858



859

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

860

What are you quacking about?

861



862

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

863

Dumb Donald Dodo!

864



865

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

866

Step away from the duck.

867



868

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

869

Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

871

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

872

Sorry you went doody in my hand!

873



874

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

875

I guess we're not going out anymore.

876



877

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

878

Man!

879



880

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

881

Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.[br]I couldn't find you before.

882



883

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

884

What's all this about L.A.?

885



886

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

887

They still want me[br]for General Hospital.

888



889

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

890

But. . .

891



892

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

893

. . .what about us?

894



895

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

896

Last night was wonderful.

897



898

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

899

But I can't stay here just for you.

900



901

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

902

So stay for the museums.

903



904

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

905

-I'm sorry.[br]-Joey, on-stage!

906



907

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

908

At least stay till the end[br]of the play.

909



910

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

911

I'll go to the airport with you.[br]I want to say goodbye.

912



913

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

914

Where are you, vic?

915



916

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

917

Flight's in an hour.[br]I gotta go.

918



919

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

920

vic?

921



922

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

923

vic?

924



925

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

926

-vic![br]-In a minute!

927



928

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

929

So this is it, victor?

930



931

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

932

Yeah. I guess it is.

933



934

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

935

Listen. . .

936



937

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

938

. . .I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say[br]it quick because this is killing me.

939



940

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

941

One thing you gotta know[br]is that I will never forget you.

942



943

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

944

But you got things[br]you have to do now.

945



946

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

947

And so do l.

948



949

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

950

And so. . .

951



952

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

953

. . .I'm gonna get on[br]this spaceship. . .

954



955

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

956

. . .and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7[br]in search of alternative fuels.

957



958

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

959

But when I return[br]200 years from now. . .

960



961

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

962

. . .you'll be long gone. . .

963



964

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

965

. . .but I won't have aged at all.

966



967

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

968

So you tell your great,[br]great granddaughter. . .

969



970

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

971

. . .to look me up.

972



973

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

974

Because, Adrianne. . .

975



976

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

977

. . .baby. . .

978



979

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

980

. . .I'm gonna want to meet her.

981



982

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

983

So long, vic!

984



985

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

986

It's been two days.

987



988

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

989

Yeah, I know.

990



991

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

992

Good thing it's one of those[br]801 numbers, right?

993



994

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

995

Phoebe, 800 is toll free.[br]801 is Utah.

996



997

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

998

It has to be 800 because all those[br]big companies have 800 numbers.

999



1000

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1001

Every. . . .

1002



1003

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1004

Yeah, every big Utah-based company[br]has one.

1005



1006

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1007

Sorry. I'm so sorry.[br]I will pay you back.

1008



1009

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1010

And yet she's still not[br]hanging up the phone.

1011



1012

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1013

-Hang up![br]-Hang up the phone!

1014



1015

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1016

Fine! Fine!

1017



1018

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1019

Well, I think I broke it.

1020



1021

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1022

But that's all right.[br]Here's the number where you can call.

1023



1024

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1025

Wouldn't it be cool if our duck[br]and our chick had a baby?

1026



1027

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1028

We could call it Chuck.

1029



1030

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1031

Or Dick.

1032



1033

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1034

Listen, I need a favor.

1035



1036

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1037

I was in the shower,[br]and as I was. . .

1038



1039

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1040

. . .cleansing myself, I felt something.

1041



1042

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1043

Was it like a sneeze, only better?

1044



1045

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1046

No. I mean, like,[br]a thing on my body.

1047



1048

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1049

Well, what was it?

1050



1051

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1052

Well, I don't know.[br]It's kind of in a place that's not. . . .

1053



1054

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1055

It's not visually accessible to me.[br]And I was hoping maybe you guys. . .

1056



1057

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1058

. . .could help me out.

1059



1060

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1061

Come on, you guys![br]It's no big deal!

1062



1063

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1064

Well, what is it?[br]ls it a mole?

1065



1066

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1067

No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

1068



1069

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1070

Is it--?[br]What, a pimple?

1071



1072

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1073

No, it's. . .

1074



1075

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1076

. . .fancier than a pimple.

1077



1078

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1079

-Ross, just go see a doc--[br]-Guys, what's--?

1080



1081

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1082

Well, it's definite.[br]Two more weeks of winter.

1083



1084

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1085

Yeah, right.

Fire safety is not a joke, son.

You're right. I know.

Look, I gotta go.[br]I'm on call tonight.

See you Saturday.

1126

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1127

He's cute, Pheebs.

1128



1129

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1130

But you just started dating[br]that teacher.

1131



1132

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1133

Oh, Jason?

1134



1135

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1136

We're seeing each other tonight.

1137



1138

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1139

Well, Pheebs?

1140



1141

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1142

Two dates in one day?[br]That's so unlike you.

1143



1144

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1145

I know, I know.[br]I'm, like, playing the field.

1146



1147

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1148

I'm juggling two guys.[br]I'm sowing my wild oats.

1149



1150

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1151

You know, this kind of, like,[br]oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

1152



1153

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1154

So do they know about each other?

1155



1156

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1157

Does a dog's lips move[br]when he reads?

1158



1159

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1160

Okay, no, they don't know.

1161



1162

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1163

Hey, guys.

1164



1165

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1166

-Well?[br]-How'd it go at the doctor's?

1167



1168

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1169

He said there's definitely[br]nothing to worry about. It's benign.

1170



1171

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1172

-What is it?[br]-He couldn't even tell me.

1173



1174

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1175

He said it was just[br]some sort of "skin abnormality. "

1176



1177

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1178

The worse thing is, he said,[br]being unable to identify it. . .

1179



1180

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1181

. . .he was reluctant to remove it.

1182



1183

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1184

You should go to my guy.

1185



1186

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1187

Because when I went in there[br]with my third nipple. . .

1188



1189

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1190

. . .he just lopped it right off.

1191



1192

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1193

So I guess I'm lucky.

1194



1195

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1196

I mean, not as lucky as people[br]who are born with two nipples.

1197



1198

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1199

At least they knew what yours was.[br]You know? Yours had a name.

1200



1201

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1202

Maybe they'll name yours after you.

1203



1204

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1205

You know?[br]They'd call it "The Ross. "

1206



1207

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1208

And then people would be, like,[br]"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

1209



1210

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1211

Yeah, that'd be cool.

1212



1213

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1214

Pete's breaking up with me.

1215



1216

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1217

What?

1218



1219

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1220

I just checked my messages.

1221



1222

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1223

He said that when he gets back,[br]"We need to talk. "

1224



1225

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1226

-And?[br]-Well, that's it.

1227



1228

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1229

People never say, "We need to talk,"[br]unless it's something bad.

1230



1231

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1232

That doesn't necessarily mean[br]he's breaking up with you.

1233



1234

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1235

Really?

1236



1237

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1238

Maybe he just cheated on you.

1239



1240

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1241

I won't get rich doing it,[br]but I gotta say, it's cool. . .

1242



1243

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1244

. . .knowing you're making[br]a difference in a kid's life.

1245



1246

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1247

That is so great.

1248



1249

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1250

Oh, my God!

1251



1252

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1253

Oh, my God!

1254



1255

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1256

We'd better call[br]the fire department.

1257



1258

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1259

Well, we don't need a fireman.

1260



1261

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1262

We need, like, a good mechanic.

1263



1264

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1265

Here they come![br]We gotta get out of here!

1266



1267

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1268

Wait. Why?

1269



1270

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1271

If I wanted to see a fireman,[br]I'd date one.

1272



1273

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1274

That's all it is.[br]A third nipple.

1275



1276

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1277

You know? Just your[br]run-of-the-mill third nipple.

1278



1279

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1280

You can take it off.[br]Just slice that baby right off.

1281



1282

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1283

Take your shirt off.[br]Let's see what we're dealing with.

1284



1285

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1286

What are you doing?

1287



1288

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1289

Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,[br]slice-it-right-off third nipple.

1290



1291

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1292

Well, that's not a third nipple.

1293



1294

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1295

First of all, it's on your ass.

1296



1297

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1298

Well, then what is it?

1299



1300

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1301

Wait a minute. Hold it.

1302



1303

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1304

-Jansen, come in here.[br]-I'm with Hamilton!

1305



1306

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1307

He's good with weird things.[br]Bring him in too.

1308



1309

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1310

I gotta go water Pete's plants.

1311



1312

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1313

You know what? lf he's gonna break up[br]with me, maybe I won't water them.

1314



1315

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1316

If he's gonna break up with you,[br]maybe Joey and I should do it. . .

1317



1318

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1319

. . .if you know what I mean.

1320



1321

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1322

Or. . .

1323



1324

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1325

. . .we could go and pee on them.

1326



1327

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1328

I can't take it, you know.

1329



1330

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1331

I'm afraid one of them[br]will catch me with the other.

1332



1333

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1334

It's making me crazy!

1335



1336

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1337

Why don't you break up[br]with one of them?

1338



1339

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1340

What happened to playing the field?

1341



1342

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1343

It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

1344



1345

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1346

It's feels like work.[br]It's like I'm working in the field.

1347



1348

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1349

So pick one of them.

1350



1351

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1352

Which one do you like more?

1353



1354

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1355

vince is great, you know?[br]Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

1356



1357

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1358

He's just so burly,[br]so very burly.

1359



1360

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1361

Okay, good. So there you go.[br]Go with vince.

1362



1363

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1364

But Jason's really sensitive.

1365



1366

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1367

Sensitive is important.[br]Pick him.

1368



1369

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1370

Oh, sure.[br]Go with the sissy.

1371



1372

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1373

Jason is not a sissy.

1374



1375

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1376

I meant Chandler.

1377



1378

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1379

You know, I have dinner plans.

1380



1381

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1382

Thank you so much for coming[br]on such a short notice.

1383



1384

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1385

Ladies and gentlemen, I've been[br]practicing medicine for 23 years. . .

1386



1387

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1388

. . .and I'm stumped.

1389



1390

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1391

Okay, this is the den.

1392



1393

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1394

All right, check this out.[br]Lights!

1395



1396

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1397

All right, less lights![br]Bad lights!

1398



1399

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1400

Lights, go away!

1401



1402

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1403

See? You just need the right command.

1404



1405

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1406

And the dimmer switch.

1407



1408

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1409

For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.

1410



1411

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1412

That's the video phone.

1413



1414

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1415

But you shouldn't be here.[br]So don't touch anything.

1416



1417

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1418

IKEA, this is comfortable!

1419



1420

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1421

This place is amazing!

1422



1423

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1424

-Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.[br]-I know.

1425



1426

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1427

It's the nicest kitchen.

1428



1429

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1430

The refrigerator[br]told me to have a great day.

1431



1432

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1433

Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

1434



1435

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1436

Joey, put that down.

1437



1438

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1439

Oh, my God, that's Pete.[br]Get out!

1440



1441

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1442

How the hell do you answer[br]a video phone?

1443



1444

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1445

I guess that's how.

1446



1447

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1448

Monica, how's it going?

1449



1450

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1451

Oh, it's good. It's good.

1452



1453

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1454

Just here, watering the plants.

1455



1456

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1457

Don't forget that ficus[br]there by Rachel.

1458



1459

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1460

Chandler's on the couch!

1461



1462

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1463

I see him. You guys[br]are the worst hiders, ever.

1464



1465

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1466

-Hi.[br]-How you doing?

1467



1468

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1469

The other day when you said[br]you needed to talk. . .

1470



1471

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1472

. . .just so I know,[br]is it good news or bad news?

1473



1474

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1475

It's good news.[br]It's definitely good news.

1476



1477

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1478

Hold on a second,[br]I have another call.

1479



1480

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1481

How's it going?

1482



1483

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1484

It's still me.

1485



1486

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1487

I've got picture-in-picture here.

1488



1489

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1490

I'm gonna have to call you back later.

1491



1492

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1493

Monica? You.[br]I'm gonna have to call you back.

1494



1495

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1496

So I'll see you soon.

1497



1498

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1499

-Okay. I love you.[br]-I love you.

1500



1501

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1502

We love you too!

1503



1504

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1505

Well, it's good news.[br]It's good news.

1506



1507

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1508

-What do you think the good news is?[br]-Look at this!

1509



1510

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1511

He wrote a check for $50,000[br]to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design. "

1512



1513

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1514

Sorry. What do you think[br]the good news is?

1515



1516

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1517

Oh, my!

1518



1519

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1520

Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

1521



1522

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1523

You gotta get Mom on the phone![br]Call Mom! Call Mom!

1524



1525

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1526

And that's Pete's mom.

1527



1528

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1529

You have to make it a theme wedding.[br]And the theme could be:

1530



1531

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1532

"Look How Much Money We've Got! "

1533



1534

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1535

I mean, you could put money[br]in the invitations.

1536



1537

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1538

You could have, like,[br]little-money place settings.

1539



1540

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1541

And you could start[br]with a money salad.

1542



1543

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1544

I mean, it'll be dry,[br]but people will like it.

1545



1546

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1547

Would you stop?

1548



1549

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1550

We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

1551



1552

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1553

We don't know if he'll propose.

1554



1555

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1556

But this is Pete.[br]He's not like other people.

1557



1558

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1559

On your first date, you went to Rome.

1560



1561

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1562

For most guys, that's like[br]a third or fourth date kind of thing.

1563



1564

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1565

Well, if that's what it is,[br]then it's crazy.

1566



1567

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1568

Monica's right.[br]We're talking about marriage here.

1569



1570

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1571

She can't just rush into this.

1572



1573

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1574

What do you know?[br]You married a lesbian!

1575



1576

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1577

I gotta go.[br]I have to break up with vince.

1578



1579

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1580

So you're going with the teacher?

1581



1582

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1583

I like vince a lot, you know?[br]But Jason is so sensitive.

1584



1585

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1586

In the long run, I think[br]sensitive is better than having. . .

1587



1588

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1589

. . .a really, really, really nice body.

1590



1591

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1592

Jason. Definitely Jason.

1593



1594

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1595

-Wish me luck![br]-Good luck!

1596



1597

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1598

Oh, my God!

1599



1600

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1601

Sorry.

1602



1603

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1604

I was imagining what it'd be like[br]to catch the money bouquet.

1605



1606

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1607

Excuse me. Is vince here?

1608



1609

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1610

Oh, sure.

1611



1612

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1613

I didn't know you guys[br]actually used those.

1614



1615

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1616

So what's up?

1617



1618

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1619

This isn't gonna be easy.

1620



1621

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1622

I don't think we should[br]see each other anymore.

1623



1624

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1625

Good deal.

1626



1627

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1628

I'm sorry.

1629



1630

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1631

No, it's okay.

1632



1633

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1634

It's just that I thought[br]we had something pretty special here.

1635



1636

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1637

I felt like you were someone[br]I could finally open up to.

1638



1639

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1640

There's so much in me[br]I haven't shared with you yet.

1641



1642

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1643

My God![br]I didn't know you were so--

1644



1645

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1646

I'm sorry. I can't talk.

1647



1648

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1649

I'm gonna go write in my journal.

1650



1651

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1652

Wait! Wait! Wait!

1653



1654

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1655

If you wanna take care of that thing,[br]go see my herbal guy.

1656



1657

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1658

Thanks. But I wanna remove it,[br]not make it savory.

1659



1660

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1661

When girls sleep with guys[br]with weird things on their body. . .

1662



1663

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1664

. . .they tell their friends about it.

1665



1666

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1667

Give me that.

1668



1669

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1670

Okay, don't be mad at me,[br]but I couldn't resist.

1671



1672

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1673

Bride's Magazines?

1674



1675

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1676

I know you said you'd say no[br]if he asked you. . .

1677



1678

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1679

. . .but how great would you look[br]walking down the aisle. . .

1680



1681

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1682

. . .in this Donna Karan?

1683



1684

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1685

You so would!

1686



1687

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1688

You should get that anyway.

1689



1690

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1691

Well, for clubbing.

1692



1693

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1694

It is so weird.

1695



1696

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1697

I know what I said.[br]But this morning. . .

1698



1699

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1700

. . .I was lying in bed, imagining[br]what it'd be like to say yes.

1701



1702

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1703

I know it's a little sudden,[br]and it's rushed. . .

1704



1705

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1706

. . .and it's not like me to do[br]something like this.

1707



1708

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1709

But it doesn't mean I can't.[br]Right?

1710



1711

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1712

I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

1713



1714

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1715

And I know that[br]we want the same things.

1716



1717

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1718

And when I thought[br]about saying yes. . .

1719



1720

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1721

. . .it made me really happy.

1722



1723

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1724

Oh, my God!

1725



1726

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1727

I know.

1728



1729

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1730

I need more pie.

1731



1732

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1733

Mon, if you do get married,[br]can I bring two guests?

1734



1735

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1736

You didn't break up with that fireman?

1737



1738

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1739

That was my way of telling you.

1740



1741

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1742

Well, it turns out[br]he's incredibly sensitive.

1743



1744

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1745

He keeps a journal and he paints.

1746



1747

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1748

He even showed me charcoal drawings[br]that he drew of me.

1749



1750

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1751

He'd prefer watercolors, but he has[br]easy access to a lot of charcoal.

1752



1753

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1754

So will you dump Jason?

1755



1756

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1757

Yeah, because I have to break up[br]with someone.

1758



1759

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1760

So Jason is sensitive.[br]But now, so is vince.

1761



1762

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1763

Plus, vince has the body.[br]You know?

1764



1765

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1766

So. . . .

1767



1768

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1769

It's really just about the math.

1770



1771

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1772

Come on in.

1773



1774

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1775

You sounded serious on the phone.

1776



1777

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1778

Is anything wrong?

1779



1780

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1781

You must be Ross.

1782



1783

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1784

I am Guru Saj.

1785



1786

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1787

Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never[br]been to a guru before, so. . . .

1788



1789

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1790

Well, relax.

1791



1792

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1793

If it makes you feel any better,[br]I've attended. . .

1794



1795

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1796

. . .fine medical schools[br]in Central America.

1797



1798

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1799

Well, let's take a look[br]at this skin abnormality of yours.

1800



1801

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1802

Come on, have a seat.

1803



1804

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1805

As I suspected, it's a kundus.

1806



1807

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1808

What's a "kundus"?

1809



1810

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1811

I don't know.[br]What's a kundus with you?

1812



1813

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1814

Please lie down.

1815



1816

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1817

I've got a salve that[br]ought to shrink that right up.

1818



1819

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1820

I guess it's worth a try.

1821



1822

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1823

Sure. We should see results--

1824



1825

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1826

Clearly not the way to go!

1827



1828

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1829

What? What?

1830



1831

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1832

We appear to have angered it.

1833



1834

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1835

We? We angered it?

1836



1837

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1838

I think I see the problem.

1839



1840

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1841

And I'm afraid we're gonna[br]have to use a much stronger tool.

1842



1843

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1844

Love.

1845



1846

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1847

Oh, God!

1848



1849

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1850

There is absolutely no way[br]this is gonna come off. . .

1851



1852

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1853

. . .unless you start to. . . .

1854



1855

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1856

What was that?

1857



1858

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1859

Well, it's gone.

1860



1861

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1862

How's that?

1863



1864

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1865

Got caught in my watch.

1866



1867

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1868

Lights.

1869



1870

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1871

Romantic lights.

1872



1873

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1874

Nice.

1875



1876

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1877

So there was this thing[br]I wanted to talk to you about.

1878



1879

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1880

Oh, right. I'd completely[br]forgot about that.

1881



1882

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1883

I've been doing a lot of thinking.

1884



1885

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1886

And I look at my life. . .

1887



1888

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1889

. . .and I feel like I've conquered[br]the business world.

1890



1891

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1892

And I feel like I've conquered[br]the intellectual world.

1893



1894

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1895

And now I have the most[br]beautiful woman in the world.

1896



1897

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1898

But there's one thing missing.

1899



1900

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1901

What's that?

1902



1903

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1904

It's time for me to conquer[br]the physical world.

1905



1906

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1907

I wanna become. . .

1908



1909

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1910

. . .the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

1911



1912

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1913

You wanna what?

1914



1915

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1916

I wanna be[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

1917



1918

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1919

It's the most intense[br]physical competition in the world.

1920



1921

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1922

It's banned in 49 states.

1923



1924

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1925

What are you talking about?

1926



1927

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1928

My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me. . .

1929



1930

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1931

. . .Jeet Kune Do[br]and Brazilian streetfighting.

1932



1933

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1934

I even had my own[br]octagon training ring designed.

1935



1936

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1937

And I suppose you used[br]a ring designer for that.

1938



1939

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1940

I want you there,[br]in the front row, when I win.

1941



1942

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1943

I want you close enough[br]to smell the blood.

1944



1945

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1946

What do you think?

1947



1948

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1949

My parents will be so happy.

1950



1951

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1952

Crazy underwear[br]Creeping up my butt

1953



1954

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1955

Crazy underwear[br]Always in a rut

1956



1957

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1958

Crazy underwear

1959



1960

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1961

What is he doing here?

1962



1963

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1964

All right, just keep playing.

1965



1966

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1967

You'll get through this.[br]You'll be fine.

1968



1969

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1970

Okay, thank you.

1971



1972

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1973

And as always, no one talk to me[br]after the show.

1974



1975

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1976

I was passing by[br]and saw you were playing.

1977



1978

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1979

This is cool, seeing you up there.

1980



1981

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1982

What's going on here?[br]Who's this guy?

1983



1984

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1985

I don't know! He just started[br]kissing me. Get him, vince!

1986



1987

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1988

What?

1989



1990

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1991

I've been dating both of you.

1992



1993

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1994

And it's been really horrible,[br]because it's been. . .

1995



1996

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

1997

. . .a lot of fun for me.

1998



1999

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2000

But I like you both. . .

2001



2002

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2003

. . .and I didn't know how to choose.

2004



2005

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2006

So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.[br]I'm a terrible person.

2007



2008

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2009

Relax. It's okay.[br]I mean. . . .

2010



2011

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2012

We never said this was exclusive.

2013



2014

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2015

Neither did we.[br]So give yourself a break.

2016



2017

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2018

Really?

2019



2020

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2021

We haven't been going out that long.

2022



2023

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2024

Come on, we haven't even[br]slept together yet.

2025



2026

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2027

You haven't?

2028



2029

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2030

You have?

2031



2032

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2033

Well, this is none of my business.

2034



2035

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2036

I can't believe this![br]You slept with him?

2037



2038

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2039

Well, I made you[br]a candlelight dinner in the park.

2040



2041

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2042

I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

2043



2044

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2045

That could've been really awkward.

2046



2047

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2048

You made him a candlelight dinner[br]in the park?

2049



2050

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2051

Yeah, but I can do that for you.[br]I'm gonna do that for you.

2052



2053

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2054

I can't believe[br]I went out with somebody. . .

2055



2056

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2057

. . .who'd have an open flame[br]in the middle of a wooded area!

2058



2059

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2060

Everything's gonna be all right.

2061



2062

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2063

Okay, Dick?

2064



2065

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2066

Hello. I am Guru Saj.

2067



2068

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2069

He's a duck, right?[br]Because otherwise. . .

2070



2071

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2072

. . .this is way out of my league.

2073



2074

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2075

He's got a really bad cough,[br]and our vet can't stop it.

2076



2077

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2078

Is there something you can do?

2079



2080

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2081

Let me see.

2082



2083

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2084

Let me see.

2085



2086

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

2087

Do you think you could get him[br]to eat a bat?

2088



2089

00:00:03.62,00:00:06.89

2090

Do you think there's a town[br]in Missouri or someplace. . .

2091



2092

00:00:07.14,00:00:08.46

2093

. . .called Sample?

2094



2095

00:00:08.66,00:00:12.45

2096

And as you' re driving into the town,[br]there's a sign and it says:

2102

-How did it go with Pete?[br]-Tell us.

2103



2104

00:00:20.86,00:00:23.05

2105

You' re not gonna believe this.[br]So I go--

2106



2107

00:00:23.30,00:00:25.21

2108

I' m sorry. Excuse us.

2109



2110

00:00:28.34,00:00:31.09

2111

-It's a little crowded. Do you mind?[br]-Could you skooch?

2112



2113

00:00:31.54,00:00:33.13

2114

Move over just a little bit.

2115



2116

00:00:34.50,00:00:35.73

2117

Keep on skooching.

2118



2119

00:00:37.26,00:00:40.61

2120

So, guys, listen.[br]I go over there and, you know, I' m--

2121



2122

00:00:40.82,00:00:42.73

2123

Why? What is wrong with me?

2124



2125

00:00:42.98,00:00:44.73

2126

-What's the matter?[br]-Tim. . .

2127



2128

00:00:44.98,00:00:46.65

2129

. . .I have a feeling. . .

2130



2131

00:00:46.86,00:00:50.45

2132

. . .my wife is sleeping[br]with her gynecologist.

2133



2134

00:00:53.14,00:00:54.29

2135

How do you know?

2136



2137

00:00:54.54,00:00:56.02

2138

-He's got access.[br]-I know.

2139



2140

00:00:58.06,00:00:59.49

2141

It's a feeling you get.

2142



2143

00:00:59.74,00:01:01.85

2144

Like when you' re in[br]somebody else's bowling shoes?

2145



2146

00:01:02.10,00:01:03.05

2147

That's the one.

2148



2149

00:01:04.62,00:01:06.89

2150

-So you went to Pete's.[br]-What happened?

2151



2152

00:01:07.14,00:01:09.33

2153

Why is this happening to me?

2154



2155

00:01:09.58,00:01:11.09

2156

Maybe it's my wound.

2157



2158

00:01:11.54,00:01:12.33

2159

Forget it.

2160



2161

00:01:14.18,00:01:15.53

2162

It's not healed yet?

2163



2164

00:01:15.78,00:01:17.10

2165

It's oozing!

2166



2167

00:01:17.54,00:01:19.89

2168

Would you pass the cream?[br]There's the cream.

2169



2170

00:01:20.14,00:01:21.46

2171

Thank you very much.

2172



2173

00:01:22.50,00:01:26.25

2174

Tomas, this is gonna be hard,[br]but I wanted it to come from me.

2175



2176

00:01:26.46,00:01:29.05

2177

-What is it?[br]-I've been sleeping with your wife.

2178



2179

00:01:29.30,00:01:30.29

2180

You' re the gynecologist?

2181



2182

00:01:30.54,00:01:33.13

2183

I' m trying to have[br]a private conversation.

2184



2185

00:01:34.86,00:01:37.58

2186

Can I have a napkin?[br]Could you please hand me a napkin?

2187



2188

00:01:37.82,00:01:40.09

2189

Just give me the thing, all right?

2190



2191

00:01:41.54,00:01:42.33

2192

Enough!

2193



2194

00:01:42.58,00:01:44.85

2195

And you are no longer my friend!

2196



2197

00:01:45.06,00:01:46.97

2198

We are finished! Nada! No more!

2199



2200

00:01:47.22,00:01:49.09

2201

You are a bastard for doing that!

2202



2203

00:01:49.34,00:01:50.74

2204

Stay away from me!

2205



2206

00:01:51.54,00:01:52.49

2207

Come back!

2208



2209

00:02:00.54,00:02:03.26

2210

So what were you gonna tell us?

2211



2212

00:02:04.22,00:02:05.33

2213

I have no idea.

2221

00:02:54.38,00:02:56.89

2222

What was the big news[br]Pete wanted to tell you?

2223



2224

00:02:57.14,00:02:59.25

2225

Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?

2226



2227

00:03:00.02,00:03:02.25

2228

Oh, keep your name.[br]Don't take his name.

2229



2230

00:03:02.54,00:03:04.57

2231

He didn't ask me to marry him.

2232



2233

00:03:04.78,00:03:07.09

2234

Then definitely don't take his name!

2235



2236

00:03:08.54,00:03:11.85

2237

He wanted to tell me he's going[br]to compete in some Ultimate. . .

2238



2239

00:03:12.06,00:03:13.78

2240

. . .Fighting Competition thingy.

2241



2242

00:03:13.98,00:03:16.25

2243

-Pete?[br]-Why? What is it?

2244



2245

00:03:16.50,00:03:18.97

2246

I don't know exactly.[br]It's sort of like wrestling.

2247



2248

00:03:20.26,00:03:22.05

2249

But without the costumes.

2250



2251

00:03:23.30,00:03:25.33

2252

And it's not fake.[br]It's totally brutal.

2253



2254

00:03:25.58,00:03:29.62

2255

It's two guys in the ring and[br]the rules are, "There are no rules" !

2256



2257

00:03:30.46,00:03:32.89

2258

You can bite and pull[br]people's hair and stuff?

2259



2260

00:03:33.14,00:03:36.25

2261

Anything goes except eye-gouging[br]and fish-hooking.

2262



2263

00:03:36.46,00:03:38.81

2264

-What's fish-hooking?[br]-What's fish-hook--

2265



2266

00:03:41.34,00:03:44.17

2267

Thanks. That would have been[br]hard to describe.

2268



2269

00:03:44.54,00:03:45.97

2270

What is that taste?

2271



2272

00:03:46.62,00:03:50.05

2273

My hands are totally clean.[br]I just gave the duck a bath.

2274



2275

00:03:53.74,00:03:55.22

2276

Thanks for the warm welcome.

2277



2278

00:03:55.50,00:03:59.70

2279

It's good to have you guys on my team.[br]I come to play. I hope you do too.

2280



2281

00:03:59.94,00:04:02.29

2282

Let's go out there and get them![br]And remember:

2283



2284

00:04:02.54,00:04:04.97

2285

There is no "I" in "team. "

2286



2287

00:04:05.22,00:04:09.05

2288

Yes, but there's two in "martini. "[br]So, everybody, back to my office.

2289



2290

00:04:10.02,00:04:12.74

2291

You! Chuckles. What's your name?

2292



2293

00:04:12.98,00:04:14.97

2294

It's Bing, sir.[br]I' m sorry. I was just. . . .

2295



2296

00:04:15.22,00:04:18.45

2297

No, no. I heard what you said.[br]Funny. I like funny.

2298



2299

00:04:18.74,00:04:21.49

2300

This team's about hard work,[br]but it's also about having fun.

2301



2302

00:04:21.74,00:04:23.65

2303

Good to have you aboard, Bing!

2304



2305

00:04:30.58,00:04:32.01

2306

That's right. Ryder.

2307



2308

00:04:32.70,00:04:34.97

2309

Winona Ryder for six.

2310



2311

00:04:37.50,00:04:38.41

2312

Thank you.

2313



2314

00:04:38.62,00:04:40.81

2315

Yeah. We have the reservations.

2316



2317

00:04:41.54,00:04:43.45

2318

All right, buddy! Way to go!

2319



2320

00:04:46.02,00:04:47.34

2321

Dude, what are you doing?

2322



2323

00:04:47.94,00:04:52.17

2324

Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my[br]butt, and acting like it's no big deal.

2325



2326

00:04:52.38,00:04:53.86

2327

What'd you do about it?

2328



2329

00:04:54.06,00:04:56.70

2330

I didn't do anything.[br]I didn't want to be the guy. . .

2331



2332

00:04:56.94,00:04:59.66

2333

. . .who has a problem with his boss[br]slapping his bottom.

2334



2335

00:05:00.50,00:05:03.65

2336

I gotta tell you, I think it's okay[br]to be that guy.

2337



2338

00:05:04.66,00:05:06.06

2339

Maybe it's that jock thing.

2340



2341

00:05:06.26,00:05:09.85

2342

You know, how football players[br]pat each other after touchdowns.

2343



2344

00:05:12.06,00:05:14.09

2345

You know, I don't understand guys.

2346



2347

00:05:14.34,00:05:17.65

2348

I mean, I would never congratulate[br]Monica on a great stew. . .

2349



2350

00:05:17.86,00:05:20.01

2351

. . .by, you know, grabbing her boob.

2352



2353

00:05:21.74,00:05:23.89

2354

I know. For a really great stew,[br]you'd just. . .

2355



2356

00:05:24.14,00:05:25.86

2357

. . .stick your head in between them.

2358



2359

00:05:27.50,00:05:28.85

2360

Can we please go eat?

2361



2362

00:05:29.10,00:05:32.06

2363

-Yeah, what are we getting?[br]-Anything but stew.

2364



2365

00:05:33.02,00:05:36.37

2366

So from now on, don't give[br]your boss a chance to get you.

2367



2368

00:05:36.62,00:05:38.26

2369

Don't turn your back to him.

2370



2371

00:05:38.86,00:05:41.29

2372

Or you could teach him[br]a lesson, you know?

2373



2374

00:05:41.54,00:05:45.93

2375

What you do is rub something that[br]smells really bad on your butt, right?

2376



2377

00:05:46.14,00:05:49.37

2378

Then, when he goes to smack you,[br]his hand will smell.

2379



2380

00:05:52.10,00:05:55.53

2381

Now, what could you rub on your butt[br]that would smell bad?

2382



2383

00:05:58.42,00:06:00.33

2384

What if Joey was President?

2385



2386

00:06:03.62,00:06:04.94

2387

Can I ask you something?

2388



2389

00:06:05.62,00:06:07.29

2390

Okay, you can totally say no. . .

2391



2392

00:06:07.50,00:06:11.38

2393

. . .but would it be okay with you[br]if I set Ross up on a date?

2394



2395

00:06:13.54,00:06:14.33

2396

With who?

2397



2398

00:06:14.58,00:06:17.30

2399

My friend Bonnie.[br]She always thought Ross was cute. . .

2400



2401

00:06:17.54,00:06:20.05

2402

. . .and she asked if I could set it up.

2403



2404

00:06:20.26,00:06:22.85

2405

-But if that's not cool. . . .[br]-Which one is Bonnie?

2406



2407

00:06:23.10,00:06:25.45

2408

You remember her from[br]my birthday party?

2409



2410

00:06:25.70,00:06:27.73

2411

Average height. . .

2412



2413

00:06:27.98,00:06:30.09

2414

. . .medium build, bald. . . .

2415



2416

00:06:33.82,00:06:35.17

2417

That's fine.

2418



2419

00:06:35.78,00:06:38.85

2420

Great! Okay! Good for you![br]All right!

2421



2422

00:06:44.26,00:06:46.98

2423

You are iron! You are steel!

2424



2425

00:06:47.66,00:06:51.05

2426

Let me ask you, how come when I call[br]your computer support line. . .

2427



2428

00:06:51.26,00:06:53.25

2429

. . .I have to wait an hour and a half?

2430



2431

00:06:53.50,00:06:56.85

2432

We' re adding operators all the time.[br]Could we concentrate on my training?

2433



2434

00:06:57.06,00:07:00.33

2435

It's just hard when I know[br]I have e-mail I can't get.

2436



2437

00:07:06.22,00:07:07.05

2438

Hi, honey.

2439



2440

00:07:07.26,00:07:09.33

2441

On the table. On the table, please.

2442



2443

00:07:12.74,00:07:15.85

2444

So listen, my friends were[br]telling me a little bit about. . .

2445



2446

00:07:16.06,00:07:17.78

2447

. . .this Ultimate Fighting thing.

2448



2449

00:07:18.02,00:07:19.89

2450

It sounds really dangerous.

2451



2452

00:07:20.14,00:07:23.10

2453

I don't want you to get hurt[br]because I kind of like you.

2454



2455

00:07:23.30,00:07:26.57

2456

I don't want to get hurt either.[br]I' m being smart about this.

2457



2458

00:07:26.82,00:07:29.70

2459

See these guys? They' re[br]the best trainers in the world.

2460



2461

00:07:29.94,00:07:32.66

2462

And Hoshi here used to be[br]a paid assassin.

2463



2464

00:07:33.42,00:07:35.89

2465

A house painter![br]He used to be a house painter!

2466



2467

00:07:38.34,00:07:41.06

2468

-Promise me you'll be careful.[br]-I promise.

2469



2470

00:07:41.26,00:07:44.14

2471

Are we still on for tonight?[br]Good. Because. . .

2472



2473

00:07:44.34,00:07:46.98

2474

. . .maybe we could have[br]a little workout of our own.

2475



2476

00:07:47.22,00:07:48.86

2477

No boom-boom before big fight!

2478



2479

00:07:53.66,00:07:54.93

2480

How about just a boom?

2481



2482

00:07:59.42,00:08:01.65

2483

That was depressing.[br]I just bought a pretzel. . .

2484



2485

00:08:01.86,00:08:03.85

2486

. . .from one of the kids from Fame.

2487



2488

00:08:04.70,00:08:07.61

2489

Ready to go to the movies?[br]Oh, this is Bonnie!

2490



2491

00:08:09.82,00:08:10.93

2492

This is Bonnie?

2493



2494

00:08:11.18,00:08:13.05

2495

This is Bonnie? You' re Bonnie?

2496



2497

00:08:13.26,00:08:16.06

2498

I can show you an l.D. if you want.

2499



2500

00:08:16.26,00:08:20.14

2501

Oh, no. You look a lot different[br]than the last time I saw you.

2502



2503

00:08:20.38,00:08:23.13

2504

Oh, yeah. Well, I just[br]started wearing bras again.

2505



2506

00:08:23.90,00:08:25.57

2507

Oh, that must be it.

2508



2509

00:08:27.06,00:08:28.25

2510

Have fun tonight.

2511



2512

00:08:28.46,00:08:29.61

2513

Thanks. You too.

2514



2515

00:08:36.10,00:08:37.29

2516

You said she was bald.

2517



2518

00:08:37.54,00:08:39.26

2519

She was bald. She's not now.

2520



2521

00:08:41.26,00:08:43.05

2522

How could you not tell me[br]she has hair?

2523



2524

00:08:43.30,00:08:46.05

2525

I don't know.[br]I hardly ever say that about people.

2526



2527

00:08:46.30,00:08:48.05

2528

Oh, well this is just perfect!

2529



2530

00:08:48.70,00:08:51.53

2531

Well, I' m sorry.[br]I thought you said it was okay.

2532



2533

00:08:51.78,00:08:56.06

2534

I said it was okay when I thought[br]she was some weird bald chick.

2535



2536

00:08:56.26,00:08:58.69

2537

That girl has got hair[br]all over her head!

2538



2539

00:09:01.06,00:09:05.05

2540

-Maybe Ross won't like her personality.[br]-Does she have a bad personality?

2541



2542

00:09:05.26,00:09:07.25

2543

Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

2544



2545

00:09:12.74,00:09:13.53

2546

Bing!

2547



2548

00:09:15.66,00:09:18.49

2549

Read your CompuTek proposal.[br]Real home run.

2550



2551

00:09:19.86,00:09:22.50

2552

Barely got you that time.[br]Get over here!

2553



2554

00:09:23.34,00:09:24.13

2555

Come on.

2556



2557

00:09:24.74,00:09:26.25

2558

Oh, yeah! Good one.

2559



2560

00:09:26.50,00:09:28.93

2561

That was a good one.[br]Keep at it, team!

2562



2563

00:09:30.46,00:09:32.10

2564

-What is with him?[br]-"With him"?

2565



2566

00:09:32.34,00:09:34.65

2567

You' re his favorite.[br]You' re his guy!

2568



2569

00:09:34.86,00:09:36.21

2570

We never get smacked.

2571



2572

00:09:37.74,00:09:39.73

2573

That's not true.[br]He smacked you once.

2574



2575

00:09:39.98,00:09:42.97

2576

Not on purpose.[br]He ricocheted off you and got me.

2577



2578

00:09:43.30,00:09:46.18

2579

I' m telling you,[br]I need some smacks.

2580



2581

00:09:46.74,00:09:48.57

2582

I got a kid starting Dartmouth.

2583



2584

00:09:48.82,00:09:51.46

2585

Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?[br]Dartmouth sucks!

2586



2587

00:09:51.66,00:09:53.09

2588

-You go to Dartmouth?[br]-No, sir.

2589



2590

00:09:53.34,00:09:54.82

2591

There you go!

2592



2593

00:10:02.94,00:10:04.45

2594

God, Ross! What is that?

2595



2596

00:10:04.70,00:10:06.26

2597

The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

2598



2599

00:10:06.46,00:10:09.42

2600

I saved 30 cents.[br]Plus, I get to keep the cup.

2601



2602

00:10:11.66,00:10:13.89

2603

From New York City, New York. . .

2604



2605

00:10:14.14,00:10:18.10

2606

. . .appearing in his Ultimate[br]Fighting Championship debut. . .

2607



2608

00:10:18.34,00:10:21.93

2609

. . .he's known for his[br]confrontational business style!

2610



2611

00:10:23.06,00:10:26.37

2612

Ladies and gentlemen, introducing. . .

2613



2614

00:10:26.58,00:10:28.97

2615

. . .Pete Becker!

2616



2617

00:10:34.38,00:10:35.73

2618

I love you, Pete!

2619



2620

00:10:39.66,00:10:43.54

2621

And his opponent,[br]from Huntington Beach, California. . .

2622



2623

00:10:43.78,00:10:47.37

2624

. . .he's a 300-pound[br]streetfighter. . .

2625



2626

00:10:47.86,00:10:50.17

2627

. . .Tank Abbott!

2628



2629

00:11:02.50,00:11:03.29

2630

Pete?

2631



2632

00:11:03.54,00:11:04.33

2633

Pete?

2634



2635

00:11:04.70,00:11:06.85

2636

-That guy's pretty huge.[br]-Don't worry.

2637



2638

00:11:07.10,00:11:09.45

2639

I'll use his strength[br]and weight against him.

2640



2641

00:11:09.70,00:11:13.77

2642

Well, then that guy is in serious,[br]serious trouble.

2643



2644

00:11:18.66,00:11:20.38

2645

You go get him. Let's go!

2646



2647

00:11:21.66,00:11:23.30

2648

Here we go, gentlemen.

2649



2650

00:11:23.54,00:11:24.81

2651

Are you ready?

2652



2653

00:11:27.82,00:11:30.25

2654

Are you ready?[br]Then let's get it on!

2655



2656

00:11:51.62,00:11:52.73

2657

It's me.

2658



2659

00:11:53.62,00:11:55.26

2660

Monica.

2661



2662

00:11:57.94,00:12:00.45

2663

Can I just tell you how proud[br]I am of you?

2664



2665

00:12:00.66,00:12:04.49

2666

It would be nice after hearing[br]20,000 people chant, "You suck! "

2667



2668

00:12:05.66,00:12:07.57

2669

I thought you were nuts at first. . .

2670



2671

00:12:07.82,00:12:09.30

2672

. . .but you did it.

2673



2674

00:12:09.66,00:12:12.57

2675

Now you can just look back at this[br]with no regrets.

2676



2677

00:12:12.82,00:12:14.17

2678

Look back?

2679



2680

00:12:14.94,00:12:16.73

2681

You' re not gonna keep going?

2682



2683

00:12:17.10,00:12:20.65

2684

Let me ask you a question:[br]Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

2685



2686

00:12:22.66,00:12:24.30

2687

Well, no. But--

2688



2689

00:12:24.54,00:12:27.69

2690

I' m not gonna stop until I' m[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

2691



2692

00:12:28.74,00:12:32.37

2693

That guy stood on your neck[br]until you passed out.

2694



2695

00:12:33.14,00:12:34.78

2696

Let me tell you a story.

2697



2698

00:12:35.62,00:12:39.77

2699

When I set out to create MOSS 865,[br]do you think it happened overnight?

2700



2701

00:12:40.02,00:12:44.25

2702

No. There was MOSS 1[br]that burned down my dad's garage.

2703



2704

00:12:44.50,00:12:48.25

2705

There was MOSS 2 that would only[br]schedule appointments in January.

2706



2707

00:12:48.46,00:12:50.69

2708

And 862 others that I learned from.

2709



2710

00:12:50.94,00:12:54.53

2711

Just like I learned from this fight,[br]never to let a guy stand on my neck.

2712



2713

00:12:54.78,00:12:56.93

2714

You didn't know that already?

2715



2716

00:12:58.34,00:13:00.29

2717

Look, I' m gonna get better.

2718



2719

00:13:01.10,00:13:03.09

2720

Okay? I promise you.

2721



2722

00:13:06.66,00:13:08.93

2723

Just get a lot better.

2724



2725

00:13:09.34,00:13:10.66

2726

Fast.

2727



2728

00:13:12.74,00:13:13.77

2729

One other thing.

2730



2731

00:13:14.02,00:13:17.57

2732

Hoshi thinks you being ringside[br]may have affected my concentration.

2733



2734

00:13:19.74,00:13:21.41

2735

That was the problem.

2736



2737

00:13:27.74,00:13:30.49

2738

-How long until Pete's fight?[br]-About five minutes.

2739



2740

00:13:30.74,00:13:32.38

2741

They' re interviewing his opponent.

2742



2743

00:13:32.62,00:13:36.53

2744

Apparently, he trains by going to lran[br]and pulling the arms off thieves.

2745



2746

00:13:37.86,00:13:39.93

2747

-Hot dog?[br]-Four, please.

2748



2749

00:13:40.50,00:13:42.06

2750

I' m really nervous.

2751



2752

00:13:42.94,00:13:43.97

2753

Thank you.

2754



2755

00:13:46.14,00:13:49.13

2756

So how did it go with Bonnie?

2757



2758

00:13:49.38,00:13:53.37

2759

Oh, I gotta tell you,[br]I wasn't expecting to like her at all.

2760



2761

00:13:53.62,00:13:56.45

2762

I actually wasn't expecting[br]to like anyone right now.

2763



2764

00:13:56.66,00:13:58.61

2765

But she's really terrific.

2766



2767

00:13:58.90,00:13:59.77

2768

It's too bad.

2769



2770

00:14:02.14,00:14:04.45

2771

No, I' m saying I liked her.

2772



2773

00:14:04.70,00:14:06.53

2774

There are other fish in the sea.

2775



2776

00:14:07.70,00:14:10.85

2777

I think she's great, okay?[br]We' re going out again.

2778



2779

00:14:11.42,00:14:14.49

2780

I hear you. Are you capable[br]of talking about anything else?

2781



2782

00:14:16.30,00:14:18.21

2783

Which one's my turkey burger?

2784



2785

00:14:18.46,00:14:20.61

2786

The one next to my foot.[br]Sorry.

2787



2788

00:14:21.54,00:14:23.69

2789

-Fight's starting![br]-We'll be right in.

2790



2791

00:14:23.90,00:14:26.65

2792

So did your boss try[br]to slap you again today?

2793



2794

00:14:26.86,00:14:28.26

2795

Nine times.

2796



2797

00:14:29.06,00:14:30.62

2798

I had to put on lotion.

2799



2800

00:14:32.70,00:14:35.50

2801

But it'll be okay.[br]Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.

2802



2803

00:14:35.74,00:14:39.53

2804

And if all goes as planned,[br]my butt will be smack-free.

2805



2806

00:14:40.22,00:14:41.33

2807

Fight's over!

2808



2809

00:14:46.70,00:14:48.10

2810

Excuse me, Doug?

2811



2812

00:14:50.42,00:14:52.37

2813

Hey there, sports fan!

2814



2815

00:14:52.74,00:14:55.09

2816

Bing! You got those numbers for me?

2817



2818

00:14:55.30,00:14:57.13

2819

No. I didn't do them.

2820



2821

00:14:57.38,00:14:59.17

2822

You forgot?

2823



2824

00:14:59.42,00:15:01.77

2825

No, I just didn't do them.

2826



2827

00:15:02.02,00:15:05.57

2828

Instead, I hung out with some[br]friends and had a couple of beers.

2829



2830

00:15:05.82,00:15:08.38

2831

So I certainly don't[br]deserve praise. verbal. . .

2832



2833

00:15:08.62,00:15:10.13

2834

. . .or otherwise.

2835



2836

00:15:10.74,00:15:13.70

2837

I got tanked myself last night.[br]Pretty dicey drive home.

2838



2839

00:15:13.94,00:15:16.29

2840

Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.

2841



2842

00:15:17.30,00:15:20.33

2843

That's okay. You' re still[br]my number-one guy! Bing!

2844



2845

00:15:20.94,00:15:22.42

2846

Doug!

2847



2848

00:15:23.30,00:15:27.58

2849

I' m a little bit uncomfortable with[br]the way that you express yourself.

2850



2851

00:15:27.82,00:15:30.25

2852

Is it the swearing?[br]ls it the constant swearing?

2853



2854

00:15:30.46,00:15:34.29

2855

Because I gotta tell you, if it is,[br]you can just kiss my ass!

2856



2857

00:15:36.30,00:15:38.89

2858

It's not about the swearing.[br]It's more about. . .

2859



2860

00:15:39.14,00:15:41.49

2861

. . .the way that you occasionally. . .

2862



2863

00:15:41.74,00:15:45.09

2864

. . .concentrate your enthusiasm. . .

2865



2866

00:15:46.30,00:15:47.78

2867

. . .on my buttocks.

2868



2869

00:15:50.14,00:15:52.94

2870

Don't get me wrong.[br]I appreciate the sentiment.

2871



2872

00:15:53.14,00:15:56.81

2873

It's just that I have a rather[br]sensitive posterior.

2874



2875

00:15:58.58,00:16:01.73

2876

And besides, it's making[br]all the other guys jealous.

2877



2878

00:16:01.94,00:16:05.77

2879

Well, say no more. You know,[br]it takes guts to bring this up.

2880



2881

00:16:06.02,00:16:07.89

2882

Bing, you' re okay.

2883



2884

00:16:17.74,00:16:21.17

2885

Would you rather live in the[br]shirt pocket of a sweaty giant. . .

2886



2887

00:16:21.42,00:16:23.81

2888

. . .or inside his shower drain?

2889



2890

00:16:25.74,00:16:26.93

2891

Oh, my God.

2892



2893

00:16:27.50,00:16:29.45

2894

Look. It's Ross and that girl.

2895



2896

00:16:32.66,00:16:36.97

2897

Look at that! It's a line of ants![br]They' re working as a team!

2898



2899

00:16:38.90,00:16:42.86

2900

Right. Oh, yeah. It looks[br]like Ross is breaking up with her.

2901



2902

00:16:43.10,00:16:44.50

2903

I hope he lets her down easy.

2904



2905

00:16:44.74,00:16:47.57

2906

Look at that! They are not[br]breaking up! Look at them!

2907



2908

00:16:47.82,00:16:50.70

2909

You know what that is?[br]A second date, that's what that is.

2910



2911

00:16:51.30,00:16:53.53

2912

Look, she just put her hand[br]on his thigh.

2913



2914

00:16:53.78,00:16:56.25

2915

That's nothing.[br]She's very sexually aggressive.

2916



2917

00:16:56.46,00:16:57.49

2918

Oh, God!

2919



2920

00:16:57.74,00:17:02.33

2921

It's your fault. Now he loves her.[br]He'll marry her. It's all your fault.

2922



2923

00:17:03.02,00:17:04.45

2924

You said it was okay.

2925



2926

00:17:04.70,00:17:06.73

2927

You said she was bald!

2928



2929

00:17:08.14,00:17:10.37

2930

Was! Was, was, was!

2931



2932

00:17:11.62,00:17:15.45

2933

We can't let it happen. We have to do[br]something. We have to break them up.

2934



2935

00:17:15.70,00:17:19.74

2936

Just go in there and shave her head![br]You owe me one bald girl!

2937



2938

00:17:21.50,00:17:23.22

2939

Okay, first of all, breathe.

2940



2941

00:17:24.42,00:17:26.69

2942

Second of all, I don't get it.

2943



2944

00:17:27.02,00:17:29.98

2945

Aren't you the one that decided[br]you didn't want to be with Ross?

2946



2947

00:17:33.30,00:17:36.85

2948

Well, isn't he your friend?[br]Don't you want him to be happy?

2949



2950

00:17:40.90,00:17:42.01

2951

So?

2952



2953

00:17:46.10,00:17:50.41

2954

It's just, you know, I didn't[br]expect him to be this happy so soon.

2955



2956

00:17:59.82,00:18:00.69

2957

-Oh, no.[br]-What?

2958



2959

00:18:00.94,00:18:01.97

2960

We killed them all!

2961



2962

00:18:17.54,00:18:20.29

2963

It's not as bad as it looks.[br]It's a precaution.

2964



2965

00:18:20.54,00:18:22.93

2966

I' m not supposed to move my spine.

2967



2968

00:18:25.34,00:18:27.13

2969

Please tell me you' re stopping now.

2970



2971

00:18:27.50,00:18:30.14

2972

I' m fine. I'd fight tonight[br]if they'd let me.

2973



2974

00:18:31.74,00:18:34.25

2975

Now, see this circle[br]I' m marking off here?

2976



2977

00:18:34.46,00:18:36.37

2978

This is my Zone of Terror.

2979



2980

00:18:39.02,00:18:42.25

2981

You are insane![br]You've got to give this up!

2982



2983

00:18:42.46,00:18:45.26

2984

I can't until I' m[br]the Ultimate Fighter.

2985



2986

00:18:45.46,00:18:46.57

2987

I will do it.

2988



2989

00:18:46.82,00:18:50.89

2990

The day will come when children will[br]argue over who will win a fight. . .

2991



2992

00:18:51.14,00:18:52.97

2993

. . .me or Superman.

2994



2995

00:18:54.78,00:18:57.66

2996

Not that I could beat Superman,[br]but kids are stupid.

2997



2998

00:18:58.86,00:19:00.05

2999

Just sit down.

3000



3001

00:19:00.26,00:19:02.05

3002

Please listen to me.

3003



3004

00:19:02.26,00:19:07.05

3005

You are terrible at this, okay? You[br]are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.

3006



3007

00:19:07.54,00:19:08.45

3008

Ever!

3009



3010

00:19:09.82,00:19:13.70

3011

I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline[br]fracture in my right forearm. . .

3012



3013

00:19:13.94,00:19:17.90

3014

. . .and a severely bruised Adam's[br]apple, but that really hurt.

3015



3016

00:19:23.30,00:19:25.45

3017

Well, then, you know what?

3018



3019

00:19:27.42,00:19:31.41

3020

I care about you too much to watch you[br]hurt yourself like this.

3021



3022

00:19:31.90,00:19:35.17

3023

So if you have to do this,[br]you'll have to do it without me.

3024



3025

00:19:35.66,00:19:37.49

3026

If you' re asking me to quit. . .

3027



3028

00:19:37.74,00:19:40.46

3029

. . .then you' re asking me[br]to be someone I' m not.

3030



3031

00:19:40.74,00:19:42.14

3032

I've got to do this.

3033



3034

00:19:46.30,00:19:48.05

3035

Then I've gotta go.

3036



3037

00:19:49.86,00:19:50.73

3038

Bye.

3039



3040

00:19:58.74,00:20:00.77

3041

Could you leave a note?[br]I' m on painkillers. . .

3042



3043

00:20:01.02,00:20:03.05

3044

. . .and I might not[br]remember this tomorrow.

3045



3046

00:20:08.30,00:20:13.09

3047

So, in conclusion, the lines[br]all go up, so I' m happy.

3048



3049

00:20:13.94,00:20:16.17

3050

Great job, team![br]Tomorrow at 8:30.

3051



3052

00:20:16.74,00:20:19.70

3053

Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

3054



3055

00:20:19.90,00:20:22.05

3056

Goldberg, you maniac!

3057



3058

00:20:22.26,00:20:23.77

3059

I love you!

3060



3061

00:20:26.94,00:20:29.58

3062

-Couldn't have done it without you.[br]-Thank you, sir.

3063



3064

00:20:29.82,00:20:31.05

3065

Oh, excuse me.

3066



3067

00:20:31.26,00:20:34.85

3068

I forgot my briefcase, you know,[br]by accident.

3069



3070

00:20:35.10,00:20:38.45

3071

Of course, you did. Forgot[br]something else too, you bastard!

3072



3073

00:20:41.06,00:20:43.05

3074

Well, what about you?

3075



3076

00:20:43.30,00:20:45.65

3077

You' re not feeling left out, are you?

3078



3079

00:20:46.94,00:20:49.45

3080

No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

3081



3082

00:20:49.66,00:20:52.77

3083

Everybody else got one,[br]and you want one too. Don't you?

3084



3085

00:20:55.98,00:20:57.21

3086

Yes, I do.

3087



3088

00:20:57.50,00:20:59.53

3089

Now, get on out of here, you!

3090



3091

00:21:04.62,00:21:06.26

3092

Pete Becker circles the ring.

3093



3094

00:21:06.50,00:21:08.85

3095

Looks like he's just trying[br]to feel him out.

3096



3097

00:21:09.06,00:21:10.49

3098

Bruiser is charging!

3099



3100

00:21:10.74,00:21:13.30

3101

Run, you crazy, rich freak!

3102



3103

00:21:14.90,00:21:16.13

3104

I can't watch this.

3105



3106

00:21:16.38,00:21:17.94

3107

Check it out! Pete's winning!

3108



3109

00:21:18.18,00:21:19.25

3110

Really?

3111



3112

00:21:22.54,00:21:26.74

3113

Bruiser has Becker on the canvas[br]and is going for his favorite area!

3114



3115

00:21:28.46,00:21:32.25

3116

Wait! lf that's his favorite area,[br]why is he being so mean to it?

3117



3118

00:21:32.90,00:21:34.09

3119

This is ironic.

3120



3121

00:21:34.34,00:21:36.90

3122

Your last boyfriend, Richard,[br]didn't want to have kids.

3123



3124

00:21:37.14,00:21:39.65

3125

And from the looks of it,[br]now Pete can't.

3126



3127

00:21:54.69,00:21:58.52

3128

So your first sexual experience[br]was with a woman?

3129



3130

00:21:59.33,00:22:01.84

3131

I was 1 5.[br]It was my best friend, Ruth.

3132



3133

00:22:02.05,00:22:04.36

3134

And we got drunk on that hard cider.

3135



3136

00:22:04.61,00:22:07.25

3137

And then suddenly,[br]we were making out.

3138



3139

00:22:08.41,00:22:09.24

3140

Tell it again.

3141



3142

00:22:12.81,00:22:13.60

3143

Seriously.

3144



3145

00:22:16.61,00:22:19.07

3146

Can that woman talk[br]about anything else but sex?

3147



3148

00:22:20.49,00:22:24.24

3149

Yeah, sure. Earlier she was[br]talking about geography.

3150



3151

00:22:25.13,00:22:28.44

3152

She was listing the countries[br]she's done it in.

3153



3154

00:22:30.25,00:22:32.08

3155

I think we all[br]learned something.

3156



3157

00:22:33.65,00:22:35.76

3158

Hey, you guys! Look what I found!

3159



3160

00:22:36.01,00:22:37.88

3161

That's my mom's writing. Look.

3162



3163

00:22:38.33,00:22:41.84

3164

"Me and Frank and Phoebe,[br]graduation, 1 965. "

3165



3166

00:22:42.05,00:22:45.32

3167

-Do you know what that means?[br]-That you're actually 50?

3168



3169

00:22:46.05,00:22:48.69

3170

That's not "me" Phoebe.[br]That's her pal, Phoebe.

3171



3172

00:22:48.93,00:22:51.20

3173

According to her yearbook,[br]they were BFF.

3174



3175

00:22:52.81,00:22:54.00

3176

Best Friends Forever.

3177



3178

00:22:54.93,00:22:55.96

3179

That's great!

3180



3181

00:22:56.21,00:23:00.20

3182

I know! She probably has all kinds[br]of stories about my parents.

3183



3184

00:23:00.41,00:23:02.08

3185

She might know where my dad is.

3186



3187

00:23:02.29,00:23:04.28

3188

I looked her up.[br]She lives by the beach.

3189



3190

00:23:04.53,00:23:06.56

3191

Maybe this weekend we can[br]go there.

3192



3193

00:23:07.81,00:23:10.76

3194

-Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.[br]-That's too bad.

3195



3196

00:23:11.45,00:23:13.00

3197

Big fat bummer.

3198



3199

00:23:14.53,00:23:16.84

3200

So tomorrow we'll drive out[br]to Montauk.

3201



3202

00:23:17.05,00:23:18.92

3203

Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

3211

00:24:11.61,00:24:13.04

3212

Would you look at them?

3213



3214

00:24:14.13,00:24:16.16

3215

I'm never gonna find[br]a boyfriend again.

3216



3217

00:24:16.41,00:24:18.64

3218

I'm gonna die an old maid.

3219



3220

00:24:18.89,00:24:21.04

3221

You're not gonna die an old maid.

3222



3223

00:24:21.25,00:24:23.71

3224

Maybe an old spinster cook.

3225



3226

00:24:26.61,00:24:29.28

3227

-Thanks.[br]-Besides, worse comes to worse. . .

3228



3229

00:24:29.49,00:24:31.24

3230

. . .I'll be your boyfriend.

3231



3232

00:24:34.45,00:24:35.44

3233

Yeah, right.

3234



3235

00:24:38.61,00:24:40.32

3236

Why is that so funny?

3237



3238

00:24:40.57,00:24:42.48

3239

You made a joke, right?

3240



3241

00:24:42.73,00:24:44.21

3242

So I laughed.

3243



3244

00:24:46.73,00:24:48.16

3245

A little too hard.

3246



3247

00:24:49.53,00:24:51.28

3248

Am I not boyfriend material?

3249



3250

00:24:53.09,00:24:54.00

3251

You're Chandler.

3252



3253

00:24:56.01,00:24:58.24

3254

You know. Chandler!

3255



3256

00:24:58.69,00:25:01.60

3257

Okay, so we've established[br]my name, and hit me.

3258



3259

00:25:02.49,00:25:05.08

3260

But say we weren't friends.[br]Say it's a blind date.

3261



3262

00:25:05.33,00:25:09.68

3263

I show up at your door and I'm,[br]like, "Hey, nice to meet you. "

3264



3265

00:25:11.21,00:25:15.04

3266

I'd probably be scared of a guy[br]using a fake voice.

3267



3268

00:25:16.33,00:25:17.92

3269

Oh, good. You bought food.

3270



3271

00:25:18.17,00:25:20.04

3272

No, just my luggage.

3273



3274

00:25:27.13,00:25:29.36

3275

I am having the best karma this week.

3276



3277

00:25:29.57,00:25:31.48

3278

I find this woman[br]who knew my parents. . .

3279



3280

00:25:31.73,00:25:34.64

3281

. . .and then my client[br]gives me his beach house.

3282



3283

00:25:34.85,00:25:37.49

3284

What about that bike[br]messenger you hit?

3285



3286

00:25:37.73,00:25:40.00

3287

Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

3288



3289

00:25:42.01,00:25:43.84

3290

Hey, check out the hat!

3291



3292

00:25:47.09,00:25:48.92

3293

Wait a minute, I know that hat.

3294



3295

00:25:49.61,00:25:51.09

3296

I was taken aboard that hat.

3297



3298

00:25:52.65,00:25:54.52

3299

They did experiments on me.

3300



3301

00:25:54.73,00:25:56.05

3302

I can't have children!

3303



3304

00:25:57.41,00:25:59.44

3305

Seriously, where did you get the hat?

3306



3307

00:25:59.69,00:26:00.84

3308

Ross gave it to me.

3309



3310

00:26:01.09,00:26:03.16

I think she looks good.

3312



3313

00:26:04.25,00:26:05.76

3314

Did he buy it for you. . .

3315



3316

00:26:06.25,00:26:07.52

3317

. . .or win it for you?

3318



3319

00:26:09.01,00:26:11.28

3320

Excuse me,[br]my fashion-impaired friends. . .

3321



3322

00:26:11.53,00:26:13.44

3323

. . .I'm here to tell you[br]hats are back.

3324



3325

00:26:13.69,00:26:17.24

3326

And this time, they've ganged up[br]and formed one giant super-hat.

3327



3328

00:26:23.37,00:26:24.16

3329

Go, go, go!

3330



3331

00:26:24.37,00:26:26.48

3332

Now everybody wants to be[br]under the hat!

3333



3334

00:26:33.93,00:26:35.48

3335

What's with all this sand?

3336



3337

00:26:35.73,00:26:38.16

3338

Bob said there might be flood damage.

3339



3340

00:26:38.41,00:26:40.52

3341

Either that or he has[br]a really big cat.

3342



3343

00:26:45.37,00:26:47.16

3344

It's kind of an unusual house.

3345



3346

00:26:47.41,00:26:51.04

3347

It has three beautiful bedrooms[br]and no baths.

3348



3349

00:26:51.37,00:26:54.24

3350

But, you know, the ocean[br]is right there.

3351



3352

00:26:55.01,00:26:56.04

3353

Knock, knock, knock.

3354



3355

00:26:56.53,00:26:58.36

3356

Hang on.[br]Come in, come in.

3357



3358

00:26:58.61,00:27:00.52

3359

Think about it and call me back.

3360



3361

00:27:02.29,00:27:03.48

3362

Are you Phoebe Abbott?

3363



3364

00:27:04.61,00:27:07.80

3365

Surprise, Phoebe Abbott![br]I'm your best friend's daughter!

3366



3367

00:27:10.13,00:27:11.35

3368

You're lrwin's daughter?

3369



3370

00:27:11.61,00:27:14.28

3371

I mean your old best friend.[br]Here.

3372



3373

00:27:15.01,00:27:18.84

3374

-Lily? From high school? Remember?[br]-Oh, God, Lily. Yes.

3375



3376

00:27:19.05,00:27:21.00

3377

Of course I remember Lily.

3378



3379

00:27:22.89,00:27:23.72

3380

Then you must be--

3381



3382

00:27:23.97,00:27:25.29

3383

Phoebe, Phoebe.

3384



3385

00:27:26.93,00:27:29.12

3386

She named me after you, I guess.

3387



3388

00:27:29.53,00:27:32.09

3389

Wow. Well.[br]Look, there's Frank!

3390



3391

00:27:32.29,00:27:33.88

3392

Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!

3393



3394

00:27:34.13,00:27:36.24

3395

That's my dad. That's Frank!

3396



3397

00:27:36.45,00:27:38.84

3398

I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

3399



3400

00:27:39.45,00:27:41.68

3401

Take it easy.[br]If you want, there's cookies.

3402



3403

00:27:41.93,00:27:44.65

3404

Or sangria! I could make sangria!

3405



3406

00:27:44.89,00:27:46.80

3407

Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

3408



3409

00:27:49.53,00:27:53.00

3410

Anyway, I've been[br]looking for my father.

3411



3412

00:27:54.01,00:27:57.44

3413

-Have you heard from him or seen him?[br]-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

3414



3415

00:27:57.65,00:28:00.84

3416

I lost track of everybody[br]after high school.

3417



3418

00:28:03.41,00:28:07.04

3419

Well, so tell me everything[br]about my parents. Everything.

3420



3421

00:28:07.25,00:28:10.28

3422

Oh, well, you know,[br]we were always together.

3423



3424

00:28:10.53,00:28:13.84

3425

-The other kids had a nickname for us.[br]-What was it?

3426



3427

00:28:14.05,00:28:15.48

3428

The Three Losers.

3429



3430

00:28:16.33,00:28:17.65

3431

Oh, poor Lily.

3432



3433

00:28:19.65,00:28:23.64

3434

I heard what happened. That must[br]have been just terrible for you. . .

3435



3436

00:28:23.89,00:28:25.68

3437

. . .Iosing your mother that way.

3438



3439

00:28:26.85,00:28:28.48

3440

Yeah, no, it was great.

3441



3442

00:28:39.61,00:28:42.12

3443

You know what a really good[br]rainy-day game is?

3444



3445

00:28:42.37,00:28:44.04

3446

I mean, naked game.

3447



3448

00:28:45.05,00:28:46.84

3449

We should play strip poker.

3450



3451

00:28:47.29,00:28:48.24

3452

Are you crazy?

3453



3454

00:28:48.49,00:28:52.20

3455

Come on. When you go away,[br]you have to play. It's, like, a law.

3456



3457

00:28:53.61,00:28:55.16

3458

-All done.[br]-Thank you.

3459



3460

00:28:55.41,00:28:57.12

3461

Okay. Who's next?

3462



3463

00:29:01.73,00:29:02.95

3464

No way!

3465



3466

00:29:03.17,00:29:07.16

3467

Come on, please. I'm bored.[br]You let me do it once before.

3468



3469

00:29:11.33,00:29:14.44

3470

Well, if that's the rule[br]this weekend. . . .

3471



3472

00:29:16.33,00:29:19.12

3473

-Get away.[br]-Take it like a man. Come on!

3474



3475

00:29:21.01,00:29:22.00

3476

Big bullies!

3477



3478

00:29:35.49,00:29:36.64

3479

How are we doing?

3480



3481

00:29:36.89,00:29:38.44

3482

Bored and bored.

3483



3484

00:29:39.93,00:29:42.88

3485

You know what naked card game's[br]never boring?

3486



3487

00:29:45.25,00:29:46.84

3488

So what's Phoebe like?

3489



3490

00:29:47.13,00:29:50.24

3491

I'm kind, caring and sweet.[br]What's Monica like?

3492



3493

00:29:51.73,00:29:54.08

3494

No, the other Phoebe.[br]The one you went to see?

3495



3496

00:29:54.33,00:29:56.89

3497

I think she knows where my dad is!

3498



3499

00:29:57.09,00:29:57.96

3500

Cool!

3501



3502

00:29:58.21,00:29:59.00

3503

Where is he?

3504



3505

00:29:59.21,00:30:02.04

3506

She was pretending she hasn't[br]heard from him. . .

3507



3508

00:30:02.29,00:30:04.28

3509

. . .but I found this picture.

3510



3511

00:30:04.53,00:30:06.84

3512

Isn't this what he would[br]look like now?

3513



3514

00:30:07.61,00:30:08.44

3515

Totally familiar.

3516



3517

00:30:11.97,00:30:13.08

3518

Why would she lie to you?

3519



3520

00:30:13.33,00:30:16.44

3521

We're having dinner tomorrow.[br]Maybe she'll tell me then.

3522



3523

00:30:16.65,00:30:18.88

3524

Maybe she just wanted[br]to give him time. . .

3525



3526

00:30:19.13,00:30:21.04

3527

. . .to buy me presents.[br]I don't know.

3528



3529

00:30:22.37,00:30:24.04

3530

So you're all bored?

3531



3532

00:30:25.09,00:30:28.36

3533

I'll close my eyes and point[br]to someone. Whoever it is. . .

3534



3535

00:30:28.61,00:30:31.84

3536

. . .has to think of something[br]fun to do. And we have to do it.

3537



3538

00:30:32.09,00:30:33.80

3539

Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

3540



3541

00:30:37.49,00:30:39.52

3542

You know, we could just do this!

3543



3544

00:30:43.65,00:30:45.72

3545

We all have to play strip poker?

3546



3547

00:30:49.09,00:30:50.44

3548

Strip Happy Days Game?

3549



3550

00:30:51.45,00:30:56.36

3551

I couldn't find cards, so it was this[br]or Strip Bag-Of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

3552



3553

00:30:57.33,00:30:58.36

3554

Done.

3555



3556

00:31:00.41,00:31:05.04

3557

"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.[br]Collect two cool points. "

3558



3559

00:31:06.33,00:31:09.72

3560

Get five points, you get to make[br]someone take off one item of clothing.

3561



3562

00:31:09.97,00:31:12.43

3563

It hasn't happened yet,[br]but we're very excited.

3564



3565

00:31:13.53,00:31:14.72

3566

Okay, come on.

3567



3568

00:31:15.25,00:31:20.16

3569

Daddy needs a new electromagnetic[br]microscope for Prehistoric Forensics.

3570



3571

00:31:25.41,00:31:29.52

3572

"Take Pinky Tuscadero up[br]to lnspiration Point.

3573



3574

00:31:29.77,00:31:31.84

3575

Collect three cool points. " Yeah!

3576



3577

00:31:32.05,00:31:33.68

3578

Which gives me five.

3579



3580

00:31:33.93,00:31:36.57

3581

And let's see, who is gonna lose[br]their clothes?

3582



3583

00:31:37.69,00:31:41.00

3584

I think I pick our strip poker[br]sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

3585



3586

00:31:44.57,00:31:46.68

3587

All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

3588



3589

00:31:49.29,00:31:53.44

3590

"Your band is playing at Arnold's.[br]Collect three cool points. "

3591



3592

00:31:53.69,00:31:58.44

3593

Which means I have five and[br]that means I get Joey's boxers.

3594



3595

00:32:04.53,00:32:06.04

3596

Fine. Gang up on me.

3597



3598

00:32:06.29,00:32:08.93

3599

I got you all,[br]right where I want you.

3600



3601

00:32:09.41,00:32:11.08

3602

Come on! Take them off!

3603



3604

00:32:11.33,00:32:12.84

3605

Actually, it's kind of cold.

3606



3607

00:32:13.05,00:32:16.40

3608

What if I keep them on and[br]give you a peek at the good stuff?

3609



3610

00:32:16.89,00:32:18.88

3611

I'm gonna make more margaritas.

3612



3613

00:32:19.13,00:32:21.96

3614

What are you doing?[br]Trying to get me drunk?

3615



3616

00:32:22.25,00:32:24.40

3617

I'm just making margaritas.

3618



3619

00:32:25.69,00:32:27.20

3620

Think I'll help her out.

3621



3622

00:32:30.89,00:32:32.11

3623

What is going on here?

3624



3625

00:32:32.33,00:32:33.24

3626

What?

3627



3628

00:32:33.49,00:32:36.84

3629

You're painting his toenails.[br]Chasing him around the room.

3630



3631

00:32:37.05,00:32:38.04

3632

Monica, please.

3633



3634

00:32:38.29,00:32:40.24

3635

He's totally flirting with you too.

3636



3637

00:32:41.33,00:32:42.55

3638

He is, isn't he?

3639



3640

00:32:44.13,00:32:48.09

3641

I don't know. Maybe it's just[br]being here at the beach together. . .

3642



3643

00:32:48.33,00:32:49.73

3644

. . .but it's like something--

3645



3646

00:32:55.21,00:32:56.00

3647

Hi, Bonnie.

3648



3649

00:32:57.21,00:32:59.85

3650

My boss let me off early,[br]so I took the train.

3651



3652

00:33:00.05,00:33:01.32

3653

What are you guys doing?

3654



3655

00:33:01.57,00:33:03.96

3656

We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

3657



3658

00:33:05.01,00:33:06.52

3659

Cool! I'll catch up!

3660



3661

00:33:15.65,00:33:18.32

3662

So you still don't think. . .

3663



3664

00:33:18.61,00:33:20.24

3665

. . .I'm boyfriend material?

3666



3667

00:33:22.29,00:33:25.28

3668

I saw you checking me out[br]during the game last night.

3669



3670

00:33:25.73,00:33:27.64

3671

You didn't even take off your pants.

3672



3673

00:33:27.89,00:33:28.72

3674

Lucky for you.

3675



3676

00:33:30.65,00:33:32.20

3677

-What?[br]-I don't know.

3678



3679

00:33:33.81,00:33:37.72

3680

Well, is everybody else having[br]just the best time?

3681



3682

00:33:39.01,00:33:40.16

3683

Joey's asleep.

3684



3685

00:33:49.73,00:33:52.84

3686

He passed out. We put sand[br]around him to keep him warm.

3687



3688

00:33:55.73,00:33:59.08

3689

Well, I assume the happy couple[br]isn't up yet?

3690



3691

00:33:59.33,00:34:01.52

3692

Did you guys hear them last night?

3693



3694

00:34:01.81,00:34:05.96

3695

I don't know what they were doing,[br]but sea turtles came up to the house.

3696



3697

00:34:08.33,00:34:09.44

3698

Good morning.

3699



3700

00:34:10.33,00:34:11.65

3701

-How'd you sleep?[br]-Great.

3702



3703

00:34:11.89,00:34:12.68

3704

Like a log.

3705



3706

00:34:12.93,00:34:14.20

3707

Us too.

3708



3709

00:34:16.21,00:34:17.24

3710

I'm going for a walk.

3711



3712

00:34:22.69,00:34:25.48

3713

Good morning.[br]Nice breasts by the way.

3714



3715

00:34:35.89,00:34:37.44

3716

Hey, what happened to you?

3717



3718

00:34:37.65,00:34:40.92

3719

Oh, nothing. I just felt like[br]hanging out and reading.

3720



3721

00:34:41.53,00:34:45.57

3722

The water was so great. We jumped[br]off this pier and my suit came off.

3723



3724

00:34:47.09,00:34:48.44

3725

Sorry I missed that.

3726



3727

00:34:48.65,00:34:50.72

3728

Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

3729



3730

00:34:53.01,00:34:55.24

3731

I brought back half the beach[br]in my hair.

3732



3733

00:34:55.49,00:34:57.48

3734

It was easier when I shaved my head.

3735



3736

00:35:02.25,00:35:04.24

3737

You know, I gotta tell you. . .

3738



3739

00:35:04.45,00:35:07.28

3740

. . .I just loved your look[br]when you were bald.

3741



3742

00:35:07.93,00:35:09.12

3743

Really?

3744



3745

00:35:09.93,00:35:12.49

3746

I think about shaving it[br]again sometimes.

3747



3748

00:35:13.05,00:35:14.16

3749

Really?

3750



3751

00:35:15.21,00:35:16.80

3752

You definitely should do that.

3753



3754

00:35:17.93,00:35:19.84

3755

You know what? I should do it!

3756



3757

00:35:20.09,00:35:22.68

3758

You know what? Thank you.[br]You are so cool.

3759



3760

00:35:22.93,00:35:24.72

3761

Oh, stop. Go on.

3762



3763

00:35:25.25,00:35:27.64

3764

-Now go shave that head.[br]-All right.

3765



3766

00:35:38.73,00:35:40.05

3767

What's the matter?

3768



3769

00:35:40.25,00:35:42.89

3770

She canceled.[br]My namesake canceled on me.

3771



3772

00:35:43.13,00:35:46.44

3773

She claims she had to go out of town.[br]She's avoiding me.

3774



3775

00:35:46.69,00:35:50.04

3776

She doesn't want to tell me[br]where my father is. She knows!

3777



3778

00:35:50.29,00:35:52.32

3779

Pheebs, that sucks.

3780



3781

00:35:53.45,00:35:56.24

3782

Well, don't[br]"Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

3783



3784

00:35:57.25,00:35:59.64

3785

-Where are you going?[br]-She's out of town.

3786



3787

00:35:59.89,00:36:02.48

3788

Something in her house[br]will tell me where he is.

3789



3790

00:36:02.85,00:36:05.84

3791

Some people call that[br]"breaking and entering. "

3792



3793

00:36:06.29,00:36:08.64

3794

Well, are any of those people here?

3795



3796

00:36:09.89,00:36:12.20

3797

Look, I'll do something nice, okay?

3798



3799

00:36:13.45,00:36:15.44

3800

I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

3801



3802

00:36:17.37,00:36:18.32

3803

Hey, everybody!

3804



3805

00:36:23.93,00:36:25.08

3806

Look what you did!

3807



3808

00:36:26.85,00:36:27.96

3809

You wanna touch it?

3810



3811

00:36:28.17,00:36:30.12

3812

No, but it's great.

3813



3814

00:36:30.37,00:36:31.88

3815

Come on, touch it.

3816



3817

00:36:36.01,00:36:38.92

3818

You can feel all the bones[br]in your skull.

3819



3820

00:36:47.29,00:36:51.36

3821

I was having a little chat[br]with Bonnie, and guess what?

3822



3823

00:36:51.61,00:36:54.72

3824

She brought up who was[br]behind the head-shaving idea.

3825



3826

00:36:54.97,00:36:57.64

3827

And now, who was it?[br]Oh, that's right. It was you!

3828



3829

00:36:59.41,00:37:01.28

3830

That was her idea.

3831



3832

00:37:01.53,00:37:04.20

3833

I just gave her a nudge.

3834



3835

00:37:04.45,00:37:06.64

3836

She said you gave her the razor.

3837



3838

00:37:09.21,00:37:11.24

3839

So anyone up for a midnight dip?

3840



3841

00:37:11.49,00:37:13.48

3842

-No, I'm good.[br]-No, thanks.

3843



3844

00:37:13.73,00:37:16.64

3845

-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.[br]-Okay, have fun.

3846



3847

00:37:17.93,00:37:21.04

3848

Come on, see?[br]She doesn't look that bad.

3849



3850

00:37:21.81,00:37:24.88

3851

You can see the moonlight[br]bouncing off her head!

3852



3853

00:37:26.41,00:37:27.68

3854

What were you thinking?

3855



3856

00:37:27.93,00:37:29.08

3857

I don't know.

3858



3859

00:37:29.33,00:37:30.92

3860

You balded my girlfriend!

3861



3862

00:37:31.17,00:37:32.12

3863

All right.

3864



3865

00:37:34.21,00:37:37.32

3866

Do you think it's easy for me[br]to see you with somebody else?

3867



3868

00:37:37.57,00:37:39.48

3869

You're the one who ended it!

3870



3871

00:37:39.73,00:37:43.56

3872

Because I was mad at you![br]Not because I stopped loving you!

3873



3874

00:37:44.69,00:37:45.84

3875

You still love me?

3876



3877

00:37:49.33,00:37:50.24

3878

You still love me.

3879



3880

00:37:51.29,00:37:52.28

3881

Yeah, so?

3882



3883

00:37:52.53,00:37:53.52

3884

You love me.

3885



3886

00:37:58.69,00:38:00.04

3887

What does this mean?

3888



3889

00:38:00.25,00:38:02.89

3890

I mean, do you want[br]to get back together?

3891



3892

00:38:03.13,00:38:04.88

3893

No! Maybe!

3894



3895

00:38:05.73,00:38:07.21

3896

I don't know.

3897



3898

00:38:12.85,00:38:16.04

3899

I still can't forgive you[br]for what you did.

3900



3901

00:38:16.53,00:38:19.36

3902

But sometimes when I'm with you,[br]I just feel so. . . .

3903



3904

00:38:19.81,00:38:20.80

3905

What?

3906



3907

00:38:21.93,00:38:23.44

3908

I just feel. . . .

3909



3910

00:38:25.25,00:38:27.52

3911

-I just--[br]-What?

3912



3913

00:38:28.01,00:38:28.80

3914

I feel--

3915



3916

00:38:37.09,00:38:38.68

3917

No! I don't care!

3918



3919

00:38:38.93,00:38:42.81

3920

I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker[br]with you for practice!

3921



3922

00:38:43.13,00:38:45.08

3923

But I made cards!

3924



3925

00:38:48.09,00:38:49.08

3926

Good night.

3927



3928

00:38:50.05,00:38:51.60

3929

I'm going upstairs.

3930



3931

00:38:52.13,00:38:53.84

3932

-Good night.[br]-Good night.

3933



3934

00:39:00.53,00:39:02.84

3935

Wanna play strip poker[br]for practice?

3936



3937

00:39:19.65,00:39:20.76

3938

My ass!

3939



3940

00:39:58.49,00:39:59.89

3941

Oh, it's me! It's me!

3942



3943

00:40:00.13,00:40:03.00

3944

-I didn't wanna make any noise![br]-Then don't break in!

3945



3946

00:40:04.81,00:40:07.20

3947

-I'm sorry![br]-What are you doing here?

3948



3949

00:40:07.73,00:40:11.24

3950

I came to fill your ice cube tray.

3951



3952

00:40:12.45,00:40:13.32

3953

What?

3954



3955

00:40:16.73,00:40:18.28

3956

Okay, look.

3957



3958

00:40:19.69,00:40:23.47

3959

I took this picture from your fridge.[br]I know that this is my father.

3960



3961

00:40:23.73,00:40:26.92

3962

This is Frank Buffay, and you were[br]standing next to him!

3963



3964

00:40:27.49,00:40:29.76

3965

I deserve to know where I came from.

3966



3967

00:40:30.01,00:40:33.04

3968

So if you can help me find my father,[br]then you should.

3969



3970

00:40:33.25,00:40:35.36

3971

Otherwise, you're just mean.

3972



3973

00:40:37.69,00:40:39.76

3974

So just tell me the truth.

3975



3976

00:40:40.21,00:40:41.28

3977

All right.

3978



3979

00:40:42.09,00:40:45.97

3980

The man in that picture[br]is Chuck Mangione.

3981



3982

00:40:48.01,00:40:50.44

3983

My father is Chuck Mangione?

3984



3985

00:40:50.89,00:40:52.56

3986

That's just Chuck Mangione.

3987



3988

00:40:52.81,00:40:55.04

3989

I sold him a house last year.

3990



3991

00:40:55.25,00:40:59.13

3992

And I'm very sorry, but I really don't[br]know where your father is.

3993



3994

00:40:59.33,00:41:01.04

3995

And that's the truth.

3996



3997

00:41:03.13,00:41:04.88

3998

But you're right.

3999



4000

00:41:06.05,00:41:08.84

4001

I think a person should know[br]where they come from.

4002



4003

00:41:09.53,00:41:11.40

4004

Which is why l. . . .

4005



4006

00:41:20.13,00:41:21.56

4007

I'm your mother.

4008



4009

00:41:26.61,00:41:29.64

4010

I wanted to tell you[br]yesterday, but I just. . .

4011



4012

00:41:29.89,00:41:31.60

4013

. . .felt all floopy, and. . . .

4014



4015

00:41:34.69,00:41:36.76

4016

You guys are getting back together.

4017



4018

00:41:37.09,00:41:39.16

4019

She doesn't even know what she wants.

4020



4021

00:41:39.41,00:41:41.32

4022

Rachel's still mad at me.

4023



4024

00:41:41.57,00:41:44.68

4025

Then you gotta back away.[br]You don't need that kind of hurt.

4026



4027

00:41:44.93,00:41:46.52

4028

Take it from a guy who's. . .

4029



4030

00:41:46.97,00:41:49.88

4031

. . .never had a long-term relationship.

4032



4033

00:41:50.85,00:41:55.16

4034

I know, but I really want to go[br]up there and finish that kiss.

4035



4036

00:41:57.41,00:41:59.68

4037

The water is great.[br]You should go in.

4038



4039

00:41:59.93,00:42:02.24

4040

No, thanks. I just had an M&M.

4041



4042

00:42:03.53,00:42:04.36

4043

Well, good night.

4044



4045

00:42:04.61,00:42:05.56

4046

Good night.

4047



4048

00:42:06.89,00:42:07.88

4049

Don't be too long.

4050



4051

00:42:08.13,00:42:09.48

4052

Okey-dokey.

4053



4054

00:42:11.01,00:42:13.24

4055

There is not one hair on that head.

4056



4057

00:42:13.49,00:42:17.88

4058

It'll grow back, right?[br]And she's really fun, and she's cool.

4059



4060

00:42:18.13,00:42:19.88

4061

And I'm finally moving on.

4062



4063

00:42:20.13,00:42:22.64

4064

Getting over Rachel was so--

4065



4066

00:42:23.85,00:42:26.84

4067

I'm finally feeling sane.[br]And if I go up there. . .

4068



4069

00:42:27.05,00:42:28.64

4070

. . .and I kiss her. . . .

4071



4072

00:42:28.89,00:42:30.64

4073

God, I want to kiss her!

4074



4075

00:42:31.53,00:42:35.16

4076

And it doesn't work out. Do I wanna[br]put myself through that again?

4077



4078

00:42:35.41,00:42:36.68

4079

Let me get this straight.

4080



4081

00:42:36.89,00:42:41.56

4082

If you go with Bonnie, you do the[br]smart, healthy thing and move on.

4083



4084

00:42:41.81,00:42:45.12

4085

Right? And if you go with Rachel,[br]Bonnie's free tonight?

4086



4087

00:43:09.13,00:43:09.96

4088

Hi there.

4089



4090

00:43:11.81,00:43:13.96

4091

That's that weird voice again.

4092



4093

00:43:14.21,00:43:15.43

4094

Let me try it again.

4095



4096

00:43:15.65,00:43:18.24

4097

You'll wanna date this next guy,[br]I swear!

4098



4099

00:43:23.57,00:43:24.92

4100

Hi, I'm Dorf!

4101



4102

00:43:27.01,00:43:28.84

4103

Your date for the evening.

4104



4105

00:43:31.21,00:43:34.40

4106

Oh, come on. Dorf on dating?[br]That's good stuff!

4107
