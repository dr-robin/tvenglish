16

00:00:03.51,00:00:06.47

17

Wouldn't it be cool if our duck[br]and our chick had a baby?

18



19

00:00:06.71,00:00:08.74

20

We could call it Chuck.

21



22

00:00:10.35,00:00:11.75

23

Or Dick.

24



25

00:00:15.51,00:00:17.74

26

Listen, I need a favor.

27



28

00:00:18.83,00:00:21.14

29

I was in the shower,[br]and as I was. . .

30



31

00:00:21.39,00:00:24.86

32

. . .cleansing myself, I felt something.

33



34

00:00:25.07,00:00:27.95

35

Was it like a sneeze, only better?

36



37

00:00:29.99,00:00:32.18

38

No. I mean, like,[br]a thing on my body.

39



40

00:00:32.83,00:00:33.98

41

Well, what was it?

42



43

00:00:34.19,00:00:37.66

44

Well, I don't know.[br]It's kind of in a place that's not. . . .

45



46

00:00:37.91,00:00:41.79

47

It's not visually accessible to me.[br]And I was hoping maybe you guys. . .

48



49

00:00:42.03,00:00:43.18

50

. . .could help me out.

51



52

00:00:45.91,00:00:47.94

53

Come on, you guys![br]It's no big deal!

54



55

00:00:52.11,00:00:54.75

56

Well, what is it?[br]ls it a mole?

57



58

00:00:56.39,00:00:58.95

59

No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

60



61

00:00:59.19,00:01:00.94

62

Is it--?[br]What, a pimple?

63



64

00:01:04.23,00:01:05.34

65

No, it's. . .

66



67

00:01:05.91,00:01:07.79

68

. . .fancier than a pimple.

69



70

00:01:08.03,00:01:10.22

71

-Ross, just go see a doc--[br]-Guys, what's--?

72



73

00:01:15.63,00:01:18.38

74

Well, it's definite.[br]Two more weeks of winter.

75



76

00:01:18.59,00:01:19.38

Yeah, right.

00:02:09.71,00:02:13.18

86

And this is the coffeehouse.[br]This is where I play my music.

87



88

00:02:13.43,00:02:15.38

89

-Good deal.[br]-These are my friends.

90



91

00:02:15.63,00:02:18.62

92

People? This is vince.[br]vince, the people.

93



94

00:02:20.55,00:02:22.03

95

vince is a fireman.

96



97

00:02:23.11,00:02:25.46

98

Have you ever rescued anyone[br]from a burning building?

99



100

00:02:25.67,00:02:27.98

101

Ninety-eight hot saves.[br]Highest on the force.

102



103

00:02:28.19,00:02:32.02

104

If Joey and I play with matches,[br]we could get you up to an even 1 00.

105



106

00:02:34.03,00:02:36.18

107

Fire safety is not a joke, son.

108



109

00:02:38.55,00:02:40.14

110

You're right. I know.

111



112

00:02:41.31,00:02:43.34

113

Look, I gotta go.[br]I'm on call tonight.

114



115

00:02:43.59,00:02:44.58

116

See you Saturday.

117



118

00:02:47.95,00:02:49.06

119

He's cute, Pheebs.

120



121

00:02:49.31,00:02:51.30

122

But you just started dating[br]that teacher.

123



124

00:02:51.51,00:02:52.38

125

Oh, Jason?

126



127

00:02:52.63,00:02:54.38

128

We're seeing each other tonight.

129



130

00:02:54.63,00:02:56.27

131

Well, Pheebs?

132



133

00:02:56.55,00:02:59.11

134

Two dates in one day?[br]That's so unlike you.

135



136

00:02:59.31,00:03:02.38

137

I know, I know.[br]I'm, like, playing the field.

138



139

00:03:02.63,00:03:06.34

140

I'm juggling two guys.[br]I'm sowing my wild oats.

141



142

00:03:06.79,00:03:10.75

143

You know, this kind of, like,[br]oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

144



145

00:03:11.07,00:03:12.79

146

So do they know about each other?

147



148

00:03:13.39,00:03:15.58

149

Does a dog's lips move[br]when he reads?

150



151

00:03:19.83,00:03:21.74

152

Okay, no, they don't know.

153



154

00:03:23.79,00:03:24.94

155

Hey, guys.

156



157

00:03:28.03,00:03:29.94

158

-Well?[br]-How'd it go at the doctor's?

159



160

00:03:30.15,00:03:33.90

161

He said there's definitely[br]nothing to worry about. It's benign.

162



163

00:03:34.11,00:03:36.18

164

-What is it?[br]-He couldn't even tell me.

165



166

00:03:36.43,00:03:41.34

167

He said it was just[br]some sort of "skin abnormality. "

168



169

00:03:42.15,00:03:45.35

170

The worse thing is, he said,[br]being unable to identify it. . .

171



172

00:03:45.59,00:03:47.39

173

. . .he was reluctant to remove it.

174



175

00:03:47.63,00:03:48.98

176

You should go to my guy.

177



178

00:03:49.23,00:03:51.54

179

Because when I went in there[br]with my third nipple. . .

180



181

00:03:52.71,00:03:54.74

182

. . .he just lopped it right off.

183



184

00:03:55.07,00:03:56.74

185

So I guess I'm lucky.

186



187

00:03:56.99,00:04:00.95

188

I mean, not as lucky as people[br]who are born with two nipples.

189



190

00:04:01.55,00:04:05.34

191

At least they knew what yours was.[br]You know? Yours had a name.

192



193

00:04:06.23,00:04:08.54

194

Maybe they'll name yours after you.

195



196

00:04:09.23,00:04:11.34

197

You know?[br]They'd call it "The Ross. "

198



199

00:04:11.91,00:04:15.54

200

And then people would be, like,[br]"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

201



202

00:04:17.03,00:04:18.75

203

Yeah, that'd be cool.

204



205

00:04:20.79,00:04:22.35

206

Pete's breaking up with me.

207



208

00:04:22.59,00:04:23.38

209

What?

210



211

00:04:24.19,00:04:25.75

212

I just checked my messages.

213



214

00:04:25.99,00:04:29.11

215

He said that when he gets back,[br]"We need to talk. "

216



217

00:04:29.55,00:04:30.98

218

-And?[br]-Well, that's it.

219



220

00:04:31.19,00:04:34.42

221

People never say, "We need to talk,"[br]unless it's something bad.

222



223

00:04:34.63,00:04:37.35

224

That doesn't necessarily mean[br]he's breaking up with you.

225



226

00:04:37.99,00:04:38.78

227

Really?

228



229

00:04:38.99,00:04:41.02

230

Maybe he just cheated on you.

231



232

00:04:46.11,00:04:49.38

233

I won't get rich doing it,[br]but I gotta say, it's cool. . .

234



235

00:04:49.63,00:04:52.38

236

. . .knowing you're making[br]a difference in a kid's life.

237



238

00:04:52.63,00:04:54.54

239

That is so great.

240



241

00:04:55.91,00:04:57.14

242

Oh, my God!

243



244

00:04:57.59,00:04:58.86

245

Oh, my God!

246



247

00:04:59.11,00:05:00.86

248

We'd better call[br]the fire department.

249



250

00:05:02.03,00:05:03.98

251

Well, we don't need a fireman.

252



253

00:05:04.23,00:05:06.95

254

We need, like, a good mechanic.

255



256

00:05:08.23,00:05:10.87

257

Here they come![br]We gotta get out of here!

258



259

00:05:11.11,00:05:11.90

260

Wait. Why?

261



262

00:05:12.15,00:05:14.62

263

If I wanted to see a fireman,[br]I'd date one.

264



265

00:05:17.35,00:05:19.18

266

That's all it is.[br]A third nipple.

267



268

00:05:19.43,00:05:22.82

269

You know? Just your[br]run-of-the-mill third nipple.

270



271

00:05:23.03,00:05:26.38

272

You can take it off.[br]Just slice that baby right off.

273



274

00:05:26.63,00:05:29.59

275

Take your shirt off.[br]Let's see what we're dealing with.

276



277

00:05:32.23,00:05:33.74

278

What are you doing?

279



280

00:05:34.59,00:05:38.95

281

Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,[br]slice-it-right-off third nipple.

282



283

00:05:39.15,00:05:41.58

284

Well, that's not a third nipple.

285



286

00:05:41.83,00:05:44.14

287

First of all, it's on your ass.

288



289

00:05:45.11,00:05:46.46

290

Well, then what is it?

291



292

00:05:47.03,00:05:48.75

293

Wait a minute. Hold it.

294



295

00:05:50.91,00:05:53.22

296

-Jansen, come in here.[br]-I'm with Hamilton!

297



298

00:05:53.83,00:05:56.14

299

He's good with weird things.[br]Bring him in too.

300



301

00:05:58.79,00:06:00.74

302

I gotta go water Pete's plants.

303



304

00:06:00.95,00:06:04.94

305

You know what? lf he's gonna break up[br]with me, maybe I won't water them.

306



307

00:06:05.19,00:06:08.78

308

If he's gonna break up with you,[br]maybe Joey and I should do it. . .

309



310

00:06:11.59,00:06:13.54

311

. . .if you know what I mean.

312



313

00:06:14.11,00:06:14.94

314

Or. . .

315



316

00:06:15.79,00:06:17.46

317

. . .we could go and pee on them.

318



319

00:06:20.55,00:06:22.19

320

I can't take it, you know.

321



322

00:06:22.43,00:06:25.18

323

I'm afraid one of them[br]will catch me with the other.

324



325

00:06:25.39,00:06:26.74

326

It's making me crazy!

327



328

00:06:26.99,00:06:28.94

329

Why don't you break up[br]with one of them?

330



331

00:06:30.35,00:06:33.47

332

What happened to playing the field?

333



334

00:06:33.71,00:06:35.82

335

It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

336



337

00:06:36.03,00:06:38.94

338

It's feels like work.[br]It's like I'm working in the field.

339



340

00:06:39.95,00:06:41.38

341

So pick one of them.

342



343

00:06:41.59,00:06:42.70

344

Which one do you like more?

345



346

00:06:42.91,00:06:47.14

347

vince is great, you know?[br]Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

348



349

00:06:47.35,00:06:51.06

350

He's just so burly,[br]so very burly.

351



352

00:06:52.83,00:06:55.66

353

Okay, good. So there you go.[br]Go with vince.

354



355

00:06:55.91,00:06:57.42

356

But Jason's really sensitive.

357



358

00:06:57.63,00:06:59.46

359

Sensitive is important.[br]Pick him.

360



361

00:07:00.95,00:07:03.34

362

Oh, sure.[br]Go with the sissy.

363



364

00:07:04.83,00:07:06.94

365

Jason is not a sissy.

366



367

00:07:07.51,00:07:08.94

368

I meant Chandler.

369



370

00:07:19.55,00:07:22.19

371

You know, I have dinner plans.

372



373

00:07:23.39,00:07:26.78

374

Thank you so much for coming[br]on such a short notice.

375



376

00:07:27.03,00:07:31.78

377

Ladies and gentlemen, I've been[br]practicing medicine for 23 years. . .

378



379

00:07:32.03,00:07:33.35

380

. . .and I'm stumped.

381



382

00:07:45.23,00:07:46.46

383

Okay, this is the den.

384



385

00:07:46.71,00:07:48.94

386

All right, check this out.[br]Lights!

387



388

00:07:49.83,00:07:52.55

389

All right, less lights![br]Bad lights!

390



391

00:07:52.79,00:07:53.82

392

Lights, go away!

393



394

00:07:56.23,00:07:58.42

395

See? You just need the right command.

396



397

00:07:59.23,00:08:01.14

398

And the dimmer switch.

399



400

00:08:02.43,00:08:04.50

401

For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.

402



403

00:08:04.71,00:08:06.19

404

That's the video phone.

405



406

00:08:06.43,00:08:09.18

407

But you shouldn't be here.[br]So don't touch anything.

408



409

00:08:10.23,00:08:13.35

410

IKEA, this is comfortable!

411



412

00:08:14.31,00:08:16.34

413

This place is amazing!

414



415

00:08:16.55,00:08:19.22

416

-Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.[br]-I know.

417



418

00:08:19.43,00:08:20.62

419

It's the nicest kitchen.

420



421

00:08:20.87,00:08:23.14

422

The refrigerator[br]told me to have a great day.

423



424

00:08:24.83,00:08:26.66

425

Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

426



427

00:08:26.87,00:08:28.19

428

Joey, put that down.

429



430

00:08:29.83,00:08:31.74

431

Oh, my God, that's Pete.[br]Get out!

432



433

00:08:31.99,00:08:34.34

434

How the hell do you answer[br]a video phone?

435



436

00:08:37.63,00:08:39.03

437

I guess that's how.

438



439

00:08:39.43,00:08:41.15

440

Monica, how's it going?

441



442

00:08:41.35,00:08:43.54

443

Oh, it's good. It's good.

444



445

00:08:43.79,00:08:45.43

446

Just here, watering the plants.

447



448

00:08:45.63,00:08:47.66

449

Don't forget that ficus[br]there by Rachel.

450



451

00:08:50.27,00:08:51.59

452

Chandler's on the couch!

453



454

00:08:53.51,00:08:56.10

455

I see him. You guys[br]are the worst hiders, ever.

456



457

00:08:56.31,00:08:58.98

458

-Hi.[br]-How you doing?

459



460

00:09:01.03,00:09:03.75

461

The other day when you said[br]you needed to talk. . .

462



463

00:09:03.95,00:09:06.54

464

. . .just so I know,[br]is it good news or bad news?

465



466

00:09:06.79,00:09:09.06

467

It's good news.[br]It's definitely good news.

468



469

00:09:09.55,00:09:11.86

470

Hold on a second,[br]I have another call.

471



472

00:09:12.11,00:09:13.22

473

How's it going?

474



475

00:09:13.95,00:09:15.06

476

It's still me.

477



478

00:09:15.39,00:09:17.14

479

I've got picture-in-picture here.

480



481

00:09:19.43,00:09:22.34

482

I'm gonna have to call you back later.

483



484

00:09:22.99,00:09:25.55

485

Monica? You.[br]I'm gonna have to call you back.

486



487

00:09:26.11,00:09:27.62

488

So I'll see you soon.

489



490

00:09:27.95,00:09:29.75

491

-Okay. I love you.[br]-I love you.

492



493

00:09:29.99,00:09:32.14

494

We love you too!

495



496

00:09:34.67,00:09:36.78

497

Well, it's good news.[br]It's good news.

498



499

00:09:36.99,00:09:40.03

500

-What do you think the good news is?[br]-Look at this!

501



502

00:09:40.23,00:09:44.35

503

He wrote a check for $50,000[br]to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design. "

504



505

00:09:46.43,00:09:49.15

506

Sorry. What do you think[br]the good news is?

507



508

00:09:51.11,00:09:52.10

509

Oh, my!

510



511

00:09:52.31,00:09:54.11

512

Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

513



514

00:09:54.79,00:09:57.86

515

You gotta get Mom on the phone![br]Call Mom! Call Mom!

516



517

00:10:00.55,00:10:02.19

518

And that's Pete's mom.

519



520

00:10:08.35,00:10:11.78

521

You have to make it a theme wedding.[br]And the theme could be:

522



523

00:10:11.99,00:10:13.98

524

"Look How Much Money We've Got! "

525



526

00:10:15.67,00:10:18.39

527

I mean, you could put money[br]in the invitations.

528



529

00:10:18.63,00:10:21.19

530

You could have, like,[br]little-money place settings.

531



532

00:10:21.39,00:10:23.86

533

And you could start[br]with a money salad.

534



535

00:10:24.11,00:10:26.94

536

I mean, it'll be dry,[br]but people will like it.

537



538

00:10:27.23,00:10:28.34

539

Would you stop?

540



541

00:10:28.55,00:10:30.14

542

We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

543



544

00:10:30.35,00:10:31.75

545

We don't know if he'll propose.

546



547

00:10:31.99,00:10:34.18

548

But this is Pete.[br]He's not like other people.

549



550

00:10:34.43,00:10:36.18

551

On your first date, you went to Rome.

552



553

00:10:36.39,00:10:40.14

554

For most guys, that's like[br]a third or fourth date kind of thing.

555



556

00:10:41.43,00:10:43.99

557

Well, if that's what it is,[br]then it's crazy.

558



559

00:10:44.55,00:10:47.14

560

Monica's right.[br]We're talking about marriage here.

561



562

00:10:47.35,00:10:49.66

563

She can't just rush into this.

564



565

00:10:49.91,00:10:52.55

566

What do you know?[br]You married a lesbian!

567



568

00:10:58.31,00:11:00.66

569

I gotta go.[br]I have to break up with vince.

570



571

00:11:00.87,00:11:02.90

572

So you're going with the teacher?

573



574

00:11:03.11,00:11:06.74

575

I like vince a lot, you know?[br]But Jason is so sensitive.

576



577

00:11:06.95,00:11:10.22

578

In the long run, I think[br]sensitive is better than having. . .

579



580

00:11:10.43,00:11:13.94

581

. . .a really, really, really nice body.

582



583

00:11:17.43,00:11:19.54

584

Jason. Definitely Jason.

585



586

00:11:19.79,00:11:21.74

587

-Wish me luck![br]-Good luck!

588



589

00:11:24.19,00:11:25.38

590

Oh, my God!

591



592

00:11:28.15,00:11:28.94

593

Sorry.

594



595

00:11:29.19,00:11:32.39

596

I was imagining what it'd be like[br]to catch the money bouquet.

597



598

00:11:38.15,00:11:40.26

599

Excuse me. Is vince here?

600



601

00:11:40.51,00:11:41.54

602

Oh, sure.

603



604

00:11:46.11,00:11:48.58

605

I didn't know you guys[br]actually used those.

606



607

00:11:49.43,00:11:50.75

608

So what's up?

609



610

00:11:54.19,00:11:56.50

611

This isn't gonna be easy.

612



613

00:11:57.75,00:12:00.55

614

I don't think we should[br]see each other anymore.

615



616

00:12:03.43,00:12:04.58

617

Good deal.

618



619

00:12:05.95,00:12:06.78

620

I'm sorry.

621



622

00:12:07.03,00:12:07.90

623

No, it's okay.

624



625

00:12:08.83,00:12:12.79

626

It's just that I thought[br]we had something pretty special here.

627



628

00:12:13.03,00:12:16.94

629

I felt like you were someone[br]I could finally open up to.

630



631

00:12:17.15,00:12:20.35

632

There's so much in me[br]I haven't shared with you yet.

633



634

00:12:20.63,00:12:22.35

635

My God![br]I didn't know you were so--

636



637

00:12:22.55,00:12:24.35

638

I'm sorry. I can't talk.

639



640

00:12:26.23,00:12:28.38

641

I'm gonna go write in my journal.

642



643

00:12:31.79,00:12:33.02

644

Wait! Wait! Wait!

645



646

00:12:35.55,00:12:39.14

647

If you wanna take care of that thing,[br]go see my herbal guy.

648



649

00:12:39.71,00:12:42.75

650

Thanks. But I wanna remove it,[br]not make it savory.

651



652

00:12:44.99,00:12:48.46

653

When girls sleep with guys[br]with weird things on their body. . .

654



655

00:12:48.71,00:12:50.74

656

. . .they tell their friends about it.

657



658

00:12:51.51,00:12:52.74

659

Give me that.

660



661

00:12:55.63,00:12:59.42

662

Okay, don't be mad at me,[br]but I couldn't resist.

663



664

00:12:59.63,00:13:00.78

665

Bride's Magazines?

666



667

00:13:01.03,00:13:03.54

668

I know you said you'd say no[br]if he asked you. . .

669



670

00:13:03.75,00:13:06.74

671

. . .but how great would you look[br]walking down the aisle. . .

672



673

00:13:06.95,00:13:08.90

674

. . .in this Donna Karan?

675



676

00:13:09.59,00:13:11.54

677

You so would!

678



679

00:13:12.03,00:13:13.59

680

You should get that anyway.

681



682

00:13:15.71,00:13:17.19

683

Well, for clubbing.

684



685

00:13:18.31,00:13:19.54

686

It is so weird.

687



688

00:13:19.75,00:13:22.58

689

I know what I said.[br]But this morning. . .

690



691

00:13:22.83,00:13:26.14

692

. . .I was lying in bed, imagining[br]what it'd be like to say yes.

693



694

00:13:29.19,00:13:31.94

695

I know it's a little sudden,[br]and it's rushed. . .

696



697

00:13:32.19,00:13:34.70

698

. . .and it's not like me to do[br]something like this.

699



700

00:13:34.91,00:13:37.74

701

But it doesn't mean I can't.[br]Right?

702



703

00:13:37.95,00:13:39.59

704

I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

705



706

00:13:39.83,00:13:42.55

707

And I know that[br]we want the same things.

708



709

00:13:42.79,00:13:44.94

710

And when I thought[br]about saying yes. . .

711



712

00:13:45.19,00:13:46.86

713

. . .it made me really happy.

714



715

00:13:47.07,00:13:48.34

716

Oh, my God!

717



718

00:13:50.11,00:13:51.18

719

I know.

720



721

00:13:52.11,00:13:52.94

722

I need more pie.

723



724

00:13:55.83,00:13:59.54

725

Mon, if you do get married,[br]can I bring two guests?

726



727

00:14:02.39,00:14:04.46

728

You didn't break up with that fireman?

729



730

00:14:04.71,00:14:06.27

731

That was my way of telling you.

732



733

00:14:07.31,00:14:09.66

734

Well, it turns out[br]he's incredibly sensitive.

735



736

00:14:09.91,00:14:11.98

737

He keeps a journal and he paints.

738



739

00:14:12.19,00:14:14.99

740

He even showed me charcoal drawings[br]that he drew of me.

741



742

00:14:15.23,00:14:19.43

743

He'd prefer watercolors, but he has[br]easy access to a lot of charcoal.

744



745

00:14:22.39,00:14:23.74

746

So will you dump Jason?

747



748

00:14:24.03,00:14:27.15

749

Yeah, because I have to break up[br]with someone.

750



751

00:14:27.35,00:14:31.18

752

So Jason is sensitive.[br]But now, so is vince.

753



754

00:14:31.39,00:14:33.46

755

Plus, vince has the body.[br]You know?

756



757

00:14:33.71,00:14:34.70

758

So. . . .

759



760

00:14:36.63,00:14:39.35

761

It's really just about the math.

762



763

00:14:46.59,00:14:48.15

764

Come on in.

765



766

00:14:56.31,00:14:58.14

767

You sounded serious on the phone.

768



769

00:14:58.39,00:15:00.14

770

Is anything wrong?

771



772

00:15:17.43,00:15:18.94

773

You must be Ross.

774



775

00:15:21.31,00:15:23.34

776

I am Guru Saj.

777



778

00:15:25.03,00:15:29.66

779

Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never[br]been to a guru before, so. . . .

780



781

00:15:29.87,00:15:30.78

782

Well, relax.

783



784

00:15:31.03,00:15:33.46

785

If it makes you feel any better,[br]I've attended. . .

786



787

00:15:33.71,00:15:35.94

788

. . .fine medical schools[br]in Central America.

789



790

00:15:36.63,00:15:39.86

791

Well, let's take a look[br]at this skin abnormality of yours.

792



793

00:15:40.11,00:15:41.75

794

Come on, have a seat.

795



796

00:15:45.79,00:15:48.43

797

As I suspected, it's a kundus.

798



799

00:15:50.83,00:15:51.90

800

What's a "kundus"?

801



802

00:15:52.11,00:15:55.34

803

I don't know.[br]What's a kundus with you?

804



805

00:15:59.71,00:16:00.74

806

Please lie down.

807



808

00:16:01.15,00:16:04.74

809

I've got a salve that[br]ought to shrink that right up.

810



811

00:16:04.95,00:16:06.75

812

I guess it's worth a try.

813



814

00:16:06.95,00:16:08.59

815

Sure. We should see results--

816



817

00:16:09.19,00:16:11.34

818

Clearly not the way to go!

819



820

00:16:12.83,00:16:14.15

821

What? What?

822



823

00:16:14.39,00:16:16.46

824

We appear to have angered it.

825



826

00:16:16.95,00:16:18.78

827

We? We angered it?

828



829

00:16:20.99,00:16:22.94

830

I think I see the problem.

831



832

00:16:23.43,00:16:26.82

833

And I'm afraid we're gonna[br]have to use a much stronger tool.

834



835

00:16:28.55,00:16:29.62

836

Love.

837



838

00:16:30.99,00:16:32.06

839

Oh, God!

840



841

00:16:34.03,00:16:37.46

842

There is absolutely no way[br]this is gonna come off. . .

843



844

00:16:37.71,00:16:39.14

845

. . .unless you start to. . . .

846



847

00:16:39.79,00:16:41.54

848

What was that?

849



850

00:16:42.43,00:16:43.54

851

Well, it's gone.

852



853

00:16:45.23,00:16:46.10

854

How's that?

855



856

00:16:46.63,00:16:48.22

857

Got caught in my watch.

858



859

00:16:53.51,00:16:54.54

860

Lights.

861



862

00:16:55.95,00:16:57.54

863

Romantic lights.

864



865

00:16:59.03,00:16:59.98

866

Nice.

867



868

00:17:00.83,00:17:04.18

869

So there was this thing[br]I wanted to talk to you about.

870



871

00:17:04.55,00:17:08.14

872

Oh, right. I'd completely[br]forgot about that.

873



874

00:17:10.83,00:17:13.02

875

I've been doing a lot of thinking.

876



877

00:17:13.43,00:17:15.10

878

And I look at my life. . .

879



880

00:17:16.71,00:17:19.91

881

. . .and I feel like I've conquered[br]the business world.

882



883

00:17:20.83,00:17:23.63

884

And I feel like I've conquered[br]the intellectual world.

885



886

00:17:24.75,00:17:27.95

887

And now I have the most[br]beautiful woman in the world.

888



889

00:17:31.15,00:17:32.74

890

But there's one thing missing.

891



892

00:17:34.07,00:17:35.22

893

What's that?

894



895

00:17:36.79,00:17:39.62

896

It's time for me to conquer[br]the physical world.

897



898

00:17:46.31,00:17:47.95

899

I wanna become. . .

900



901

00:17:48.63,00:17:50.94

902

. . .the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

903



904

00:17:52.11,00:17:53.43

905

You wanna what?

906



907

00:17:54.55,00:17:56.58

908

I wanna be[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

909



910

00:17:56.83,00:17:59.55

911

It's the most intense[br]physical competition in the world.

912



913

00:17:59.75,00:18:01.10

914

It's banned in 49 states.

915



916

00:18:01.71,00:18:03.43

917

What are you talking about?

918



919

00:18:03.67,00:18:05.55

920

My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me. . .

921



922

00:18:05.75,00:18:07.90

923

. . .Jeet Kune Do[br]and Brazilian streetfighting.

924



925

00:18:08.11,00:18:11.18

926

I even had my own[br]octagon training ring designed.

927



928

00:18:11.43,00:18:14.31

929

And I suppose you used[br]a ring designer for that.

930



931

00:18:17.43,00:18:20.15

932

I want you there,[br]in the front row, when I win.

933



934

00:18:20.35,00:18:22.74

935

I want you close enough[br]to smell the blood.

936



937

00:18:24.71,00:18:25.94

938

What do you think?

939



940

00:18:27.51,00:18:29.54

941

My parents will be so happy.

942



943

00:18:34.71,00:18:37.46

944

Crazy underwear[br]Creeping up my butt

945



946

00:18:39.59,00:18:42.79

947

Crazy underwear[br]Always in a rut

948



949

00:18:43.03,00:18:45.22

950

Crazy underwear

951



952

00:18:48.43,00:18:50.07

953

What is he doing here?

954



955

00:18:50.31,00:18:52.22

956

All right, just keep playing.

957



958

00:18:52.43,00:18:54.94

959

You'll get through this.[br]You'll be fine.

960



961

00:19:04.39,00:19:05.95

962

Okay, thank you.

963



964

00:19:06.95,00:19:10.42

965

And as always, no one talk to me[br]after the show.

966



967

00:19:15.35,00:19:17.38

968

I was passing by[br]and saw you were playing.

969



970

00:19:17.63,00:19:19.82

971

This is cool, seeing you up there.

972



973

00:19:22.95,00:19:24.98

974

What's going on here?[br]Who's this guy?

975



976

00:19:25.99,00:19:29.34

977

I don't know! He just started[br]kissing me. Get him, vince!

978



979

00:19:31.23,00:19:32.50

980

What?

981



982

00:19:33.63,00:19:35.86

983

I've been dating both of you.

984



985

00:19:37.19,00:19:40.15

986

And it's been really horrible,[br]because it's been. . .

987



988

00:19:40.39,00:19:42.19

989

. . .a lot of fun for me.

990



991

00:19:45.15,00:19:48.03

992

But I like you both. . .

993



994

00:19:48.27,00:19:50.38

995

. . .and I didn't know how to choose.

996



997

00:19:50.67,00:19:54.30

998

So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.[br]I'm a terrible person.

999



1000

00:19:55.35,00:19:57.78

1001

Relax. It's okay.[br]I mean. . . .

1002



1003

00:19:58.03,00:20:00.26

1004

We never said this was exclusive.

1005



1006

00:20:00.51,00:20:03.07

1007

Neither did we.[br]So give yourself a break.

1008



1009

00:20:04.11,00:20:05.14

1010

Really?

1011



1012

00:20:06.27,00:20:08.38

1013

We haven't been going out that long.

1014



1015

00:20:08.63,00:20:11.19

1016

Come on, we haven't even[br]slept together yet.

1017



1018

00:20:11.95,00:20:13.35

1019

You haven't?

1020



1021

00:20:15.99,00:20:16.78

1022

You have?

1023



1024

00:20:16.99,00:20:19.14

1025

Well, this is none of my business.

1026



1027

00:20:21.87,00:20:24.83

1028

I can't believe this![br]You slept with him?

1029



1030

00:20:25.11,00:20:27.75

1031

Well, I made you[br]a candlelight dinner in the park.

1032



1033

00:20:29.79,00:20:32.75

1034

I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

1035



1036

00:20:38.31,00:20:40.54

1037

That could've been really awkward.

1038



1039

00:20:43.55,00:20:46.54

1040

You made him a candlelight dinner[br]in the park?

1041



1042

00:20:46.83,00:20:50.10

1043

Yeah, but I can do that for you.[br]I'm gonna do that for you.

1044



1045

00:20:50.31,00:20:52.74

1046

I can't believe[br]I went out with somebody. . .

1047



1048

00:20:52.99,00:20:56.34

1049

. . .who'd have an open flame[br]in the middle of a wooded area!

1050



1051

00:21:05.19,00:21:07.54

1052

Everything's gonna be all right.

1053



1054

00:21:08.63,00:21:10.14

1055

Okay, Dick?

1056



1057

00:21:13.03,00:21:14.86

1058

Hello. I am Guru Saj.

1059



1060

00:21:18.23,00:21:20.54

1061

He's a duck, right?[br]Because otherwise. . .

1062



1063

00:21:20.79,00:21:22.74

1064

. . .this is way out of my league.

1065



1066

00:21:23.67,00:21:27.46

1067

He's got a really bad cough,[br]and our vet can't stop it.

1068



1069

00:21:27.67,00:21:29.34

1070

Is there something you can do?

1071



1072

00:21:29.79,00:21:31.19

1073

Let me see.

1074



1075

00:21:31.99,00:21:33.58

1076

Let me see.

1077



1078

00:21:35.55,00:21:38.14

1079

Do you think you could get him[br]to eat a bat?

1080
