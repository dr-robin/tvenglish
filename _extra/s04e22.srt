1
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
That was the 10th timeI've peed here.

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
It's also the 10th timeyou've told us.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Sorry, it must be hard to hear.

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:17
It's easier having babies playing"Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder!

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:19
I am so sick of being pregnant!

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:21
My only happinessis from a cup of coffee...

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
...which is decafbecause I'm pregnant!

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
You want a cookie?

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
Thank you so much!

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
So, honey, how are thosemood swings coming?

11
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
I haven't had any yet.

12
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
The One with theWorst Best Man Ever

13
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
Here's the ring.

14
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
Yes, yes!A thousand times, yes!

15
00:01:25 --> 00:01:29
Any ideas for the bachelor party?

16
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
Before rings and bachelor parties...

17
00:01:31 --> 00:01:33
...you have to decidewho your best man will be.

18
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
Oh, it's awkward.

19
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
I already asked Chandler.

20
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
He got to do itat your first wedding.

21
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
I figured you'd understand.I've known him longer.

22
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
I don't have any brothers.I'll never be a best man.

23
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
You can be the best manwhen I get married.

24
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
I'll never get to be a best man!

25
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
Wait, wait.

26
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
So you'll be my best man twice,and I won't be yours at all?

27
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
Of course, you can be my best man.

28
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
What about me?You said I could.

29
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
I'm not getting married!

30
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
It's a questionfor science-fiction writers.

31
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
I can't believe it's not me.

32
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
How could it not be me?

33
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
I'm not even...

34
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
You know what?That's it.

35
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
From now on,Joey will be my best man.

36
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
Shame about you, though.

37
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
- Stop it.- What?

38
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
One of the babies is kicking.

39
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
That's a good thing.

40
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
It's not kicking me.It's kicking another baby.

41
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
Don't make me come in there!

42
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Do you have a big bowlI can borrow?

43
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
There's one under the cabinet.

44
00:02:41 --> 00:02:42
Why do you need it?

45
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
We're having a party tomorrow night.

46
00:02:45 --> 00:02:46
Are you planning on inviting us?

47
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
No. Later!

48
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!

49
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
Hormones.

50
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
How come you're having a partyand we're not invited?

51
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
It's Ross' bachelor party.

52
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
Are you bachelors?

53
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
Are you strippers?

54
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
Then you're not invited.

55
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
Then you're not invitedto our party either.

56
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
What party?

57
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
Phoebe's baby shower.

58
00:03:17 --> 00:03:23
Baby shower? That so doesn't soundlike something I want to do.

59
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
I can't believeI'm going to have a party.

60
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
That's so great.A party!

61
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
I don't know why.

62
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
This is what I got goingfor the party liquor-wise.

63
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
- Get a lot of liquor.- Great.

64
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
In terms of the invite list,I got you, me and Chandler.

65
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
I'll invite Gunther becausewe're talking pretty loud.

66
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
I'll be there.

67
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
I know it's your party...

68
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
...but I'd like to limitthe number of museum geeks.

69
00:03:55 --> 00:04:00
Let's not invite any anthropologists.Just the dinosaur dudes.

70
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
We'll need a six-pack of Zima.

71
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
Hey, what are you doing?

72
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
Just planning my bachelor partywith my best man.

73
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
Good luck tryingto top the last one.

74
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
It won't be that difficultsince this one won't be...

75
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
...in the basement of a Pizza Hut.

76
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
I'm Ross, I'm Ross.I'm too good for the Hut.

77
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
I gotta go pick up Ben.Everything sounds great.

78
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
Keep it on the mellow side.A few guys hanging out.

79
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
No strippers or anything.

80
00:04:29 --> 00:04:30
You got it.

81
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
See you later.

82
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
Have fun planning your mellow party.

83
00:04:36 --> 00:04:41
There will be strippers. He didn'tsay anything about no strippers.

84
00:04:41 --> 00:04:42
He just said, "No strippers."

85
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
I chose not to hear that.

86
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
Look what I got, look what I got!

87
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
They make these for little people!

88
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
Little Village People.

89
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
Look at this one.This is my favorite.

90
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
That is so sweet.

91
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
Phoebe will love dressing them.

92
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
Except she won't be the onewho gets to dress them.

93
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
She won't get to keep the babies.

94
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
My God, we are throwingthe most depressing baby shower!

95
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
Unless we give her all giftsshe can use after her pregnancy.

96
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
Like regular coffee.Tequila!

97
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
And those leather pantsshe's always wanted!

98
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
She'll love that!

99
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
What the hell is this?

100
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
You thought it'd make me feel better?

101
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
To give me somethingI can't use for two months?

102
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
This sucks!

103
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
What's my next present?

104
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
We don't have anything.

105
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Listen, about the stripper...

106
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
Good call!

107
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
A little announcement.

108
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
I've decided that my best manis my best friend Gunther.

109
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
What's my last name?

110
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
Central Perk?

111
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.

112
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
Hey, Gunther!Don't forget your shirt.

113
00:06:07 --> 00:06:08
What are those?

114
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
Little party favors.Check it out.

115
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
Just want everybody to know theposition of my best man is still open.

116
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
So is the position of the bride.

117
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
Great.

118
00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
Smooth, man.

119
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
You got some chili on your neck.

120
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
I just want to say thanks, everyone.This was great!

121
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
See you guys Monday morning.

122
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
- Thanks, Joey.- Don't forget your shirt.

123
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Hey, museum geeks!Party's over.

124
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
Wave bye-bye to the nice lady.There you go.

125
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
Back to your parents' basement.All right.

126
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
Boys, come on out.Here you go.

127
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
Look at the birdies!Are those yours?

128
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
They let you keepchickens and ducks as pets?

129
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
And I got the ducktotally trained too.

130
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
Stare at the wall.

131
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
Hardly move.

132
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
Be white.

133
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
You are good at that.

134
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
I had fun tonight.

135
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
You throw one hell of a party.

136
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
It was great meeting you.

137
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
If any of my friends ever get marriedor have a birthday or a Tuesday...

138
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
Yeah, that'd be great.

139
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
So, I guess, good night.

140
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
Unless you want to hang around.

141
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
I'll let you play with my duck.

142
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
Stripper!

143
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
The stripper stole the ring!

144
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
Chandler, get up!The stripper stole the ring!

145
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
- What?- The ring is gone!

146
00:08:08 --> 00:08:12
Just give me a minuteto wake up for this.

147
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
You lost the ring.You're the worst best man!

148
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
This isn't funny.I go to sleep, everything's cool.

149
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
I wake up, the stripper's gone,and the ring is gone!

150
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
- You slept with her?- Of course!

151
00:08:30 --> 00:08:35
I wanted to apologize if I seemeda tad edgy yesterday at my shower.

152
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Just the hormones.

153
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
- No, we...- Hormones.

154
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
I wanted to say thank you.It was so sweet.

155
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
You seem to be doing much better.

156
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
- How are things going?- Good.

157
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
Everything's been about me lately.So what's happening with you?

158
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
We were just talking about menot going to Ross' wedding.

159
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
It just might be too hard,given the history and all that.

160
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
This reminds me of the timewhen I lived on the street.

161
00:09:05 --> 00:09:09
This guy offered to buy me foodif I slept with him.

162
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
How is this like that?

163
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
Well, let's see.It's not really like that.

164
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
Because that was an actual problem.

165
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
And yours is just a bunchof high-school crap...

166
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
...that nobody really gives!

167
00:09:27 --> 00:09:28
I'm sorry. I just thought...

168
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
Here come the water works.

169
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
I called the company that sent her,and they don't care.

170
00:09:35 --> 00:09:40
I called 911 and they yelled at me,This is an emergency!

171
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
Thanks again for the party.The guys from work had a blast.

172
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
One of them had never beento a bachelor party before.

173
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
Another one had never beento a party before.

174
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
So that wedding ring.

175
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
Man, that is nice.

176
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
I might pick one of thosebabies up for myself.

177
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
Where might one get one of those?

178
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
When my grandmother first cameto this country...

179
00:10:08 --> 00:10:13
...that ring and the clothes on her backwere all she had with her.

180
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
So you might saythat the ring is irreplaceable.

181
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
It's been in my familyfor generations.

182
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
Every bride who's worn ithas lived a long and happy life.

183
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
So you might say it's a magic ring.

184
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
Yeah, the stripper stole it.

185
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
My ring?My wedding ring?

186
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
The stripper stole my wedding ring?

187
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
How could this happen?

188
00:10:40 --> 00:10:45
It all started when you said,"Joey, you be my best man!"

189
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
All right.I'm going to call the cops.

190
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
I screwed up.But you don't have to turn me in.

191
00:10:51 --> 00:10:52
Not on you, on the stripper.

192
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
I already did that.

193
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
They said they'd look into itafter they solve all the murders.

194
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
- We'll call the company that sent her.- I did that too.

195
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
They said if I bother them again,they'd call the police.

196
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
I said, "You talk to the police,you tell them I'm missing a ring."

197
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
So there's nothing we can do?

198
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
How could this happen?

199
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
Look, Ross, I am so sorry.

200
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
What if we just called her...

201
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
...used a fake nameand had her come to my office?

202
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
That sounds like fun,but we got a ring to find!

203
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
Here's your tea, Phoebe.

204
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
It's so good.

205
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
Thanks.

206
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
- Good.- So glad you like it.

207
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
What?

208
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
She made the tea.

209
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
I think I just had a contraction.

210
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
- What?- My God!

211
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
I felt one a few minutes ago.

212
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
That definitely was one.

213
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
You can't have the baby here.

214
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
I haven't sterilized the apartmentsince the guys moved out!

215
00:11:59 --> 00:12:04
It's okay. I'll boil some waterand rip up some sheets.

216
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
It's probably false labor.

217
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
That can happen near the end.Just get the book.

218
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
Get the book!

219
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
- The Bible?- I don't know!

220
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
All right.This is great.

221
00:12:20 --> 00:12:21
You get behind the desk.

222
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
When she comes in,she won't recognize you because...

223
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
Well, why would she?

224
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
And then you buzz Ross and I.

225
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
You be Mr. Gonzales,and I'll be Mr. Wong.

226
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
Diverse.

227
00:12:35 --> 00:12:38
Anybody call for security?

228
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
You be cool.

229
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
Which one is Gunther Central Perk?

230
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
Where's my ring?My dead grandmother's wedding ring.

231
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Way to be cool, man.

232
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
What?

233
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
There was a ring in a box.After you left, it was gone.

234
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
You think I stole some ring?

235
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
Just save yourself the timeand confess.

236
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
Who are you, the Hardy Boys?

237
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
I don't need to steal a stupid ring.I make $1,600 a week.

238
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
Any of you guys make that?

239
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
Marry me.

240
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
It was in my room all night.She didn't take it.

241
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
I didn't take it.You didn't take it. Then who did?

242
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
We're trying to think.

243
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
I don't get how you knowit's false labor.

244
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
Do you see any babies?

245
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49
How do you feel?

246
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
Okay, I guess.

247
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
I don't know.

248
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
I know it's goingto be over soon so...

249
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
But isn't that a good thing?

250
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
- You said you were sick of this.- I know.

251
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
Usually, when you're donewith the pregnant thing...

252
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
...you get to do the mom thing.

253
00:14:07 --> 00:14:12
But I'll be sitting around in myleather pants, drinking tequila.

254
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
Some moms do that.

255
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
That's even sadder.

256
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
Look, I know what I got myself into.

257
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
It's just thatnow that they're in me...

258
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
...it's like I know them and...

259
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
It just won't be easywhen these babies have to go away.

260
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
I know, sweetie.

261
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
But it's not likeyou won't have anything.

262
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
You'll have nieces and nephews.That's even better.

263
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
No, really.

264
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
You won't be the oneworrying about saving for college.

265
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
Or yelling at them when they're bad.

266
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
Or putting them on Ritalinwhen they just won't calm down.

267
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
You'll be the one they run away to.The one they talk to about sex.

268
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.

269
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
Cool Aunt Phoebe.

270
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
I am pretty cool.

271
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
And you know what else?Are they going to love you!

272
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
They are going to love me.

273
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
Thanks, you guys. Again.

274
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
Oh, sweetie.

275
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
What?

276
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
Just kidding.

277
00:15:21 --> 00:15:21
Oh, my God!

278
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
Got you again.You're so easy!

279
00:15:26 --> 00:15:28
If anything happens to him...

280
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
The vet saidit's a simple procedure.

281
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
Things can go wrong.What if he doesn't make it?

282
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
He will, Joe.

283
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
But what if he doesn't?

284
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
He's such a good duck.

285
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
I'm so worried about him!

286
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
Somebody lose a ring?

287
00:16:13 --> 00:16:17
Oh, my God!Thank you! Thank you so much!

288
00:16:19 --> 00:16:20
How's the duck?

289
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
Just fine.You'll see him in a bit.

290
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
Great.

291
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
Thanks for being so cool.

292
00:16:25 --> 00:16:26
No, that's all right.

293
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
You made me your best manand I totally let you down.

294
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
- It's not your fault.- Yeah, it is.

295
00:16:32 --> 00:16:33
You wouldn't have lost it.

296
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
Ross, you were right.He should be your best man.

297
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
- No, you should.- Don't argue.

298
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
I get to choose my best man.

299
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
I want both you guys.

300
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
Really?

301
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
Both you guys should beup there with me.

302
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
You two are my...

303
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
I'm lucky to have just one good...

304
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
Thanks, man.

305
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
I got to go check something, okay?

306
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
- What a baby!- Total wuss.
