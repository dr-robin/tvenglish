1
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Monica, that was the bestThanksgiving dinner ever.

2
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
It was so good.I think you killed us.

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
I need something sweet.

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
Does anyone want to watch TV?

6
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
Monica, your remote doesn't work.

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
You have to lift it and point.

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
Oh, forget it.

9
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
Let's play that game where everyonesays one thing they're thankful for.

10
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
I am thankful for thisbeautiful fall we've been having.

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
Very nice.

12
00:00:40 --> 00:00:41
The other day,I was at the bus stop...

13
00:00:42 --> 00:00:47
...and this lovely fall breeze cameand blew this chick's skirt up.

14
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
Which reminds me,I'm also thankful for thongs.

15
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
The One with theThanksgiving Flashbacks

16
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
It's not so much an underpantas a feat of engineering.

17
00:01:35 --> 00:01:35
It's amazing...

18
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
...how much they can dowith so little material.

19
00:01:38 --> 00:01:42
And they play with your mind.Is it there? Is it not there?

20
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
Are you aware thatyou're still talking?

21
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
Is anyone thankful for anything elsebesides a thong?

22
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
I don't know. Am I more thankfulfor my divorce, or my eviction?

23
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
And I didn't think you'd be ableto come up with anything.

24
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
I'm sorry. This isthe worst Thanksgiving ever.

25
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.

26
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
You can't swoop in with your badmarriage and take that away from me.

27
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
You're not going to tell about yourparents' divorce again, are you?

28
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
Come on! I want to hear it.

29
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
It wouldn't be Thanksgivingwithout Chandler bumming us out.

30
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
It's a tradition, like the parade.

31
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
If the parade decided it was gayand abandoned its family.

32
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
Now, Chandler, dear...

33
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
Just becausewe're getting a divorce...

34
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
...doesn't mean we don't love you.

35
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
It just means...

36
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
...he would rather sleepwith the houseboy than with me.

37
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
More turkey, Mr. Chandler?

38
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
You're right, yours is worse.You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.

39
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
I've got one that's worse.

40
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
Really? Worse than,"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"

41
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
The little rich boyhad a problem with the butler?

42
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
Yes, mine's worse!

43
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
More bandages!

44
00:03:00 --> 00:03:01
More bandages!

45
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
Please, can I getsome more bandages in here?

46
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
This man is...

47
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
In this life, Phoebe.

48
00:03:15 --> 00:03:16
This life?

49
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
Chandler's is worse.

50
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
It must be coolremembering stuff like that.

51
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
I don't have any past life memories.

52
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
Of course, you don't, sweetie.You're brand-new.

53
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.

54
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
Let's not tell this story.

55
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
I know!

56
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
It's the one where Joey gotMonica's turkey stuck on his head.

57
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?

58
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
It's not like it sounds.

59
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
It's exactly like it sounds.

60
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
What's going on?

61
00:04:01 --> 00:04:02
Oh, my God!

62
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
I know!

63
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
It's stuck!

64
00:04:06 --> 00:04:07
Step.

65
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
How did it get on?

66
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
I put it on to scare Chandler.

67
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
Oh, my God! Monica's going tototally freak out!

68
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
Help me get it off!

69
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

70
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
Of course it smells bad.You have your head up a dead animal.

71
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
Did you get the turkey...?

72
00:04:31 --> 00:04:32
Oh, my God!

73
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
Who is that?

74
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
It's Joey.

75
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
Is this supposed to be funny?

76
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
It's not supposed to be funny.It's supposed to be scary.

77
00:04:41 --> 00:04:42
Get that off now!

78
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
I can't. It's stuck!

79
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
It has to feed 20 people. They'renot going to eat it off your head!

80
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
Hold on.

81
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
Let's just all think.

82
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
I got it!

83
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
You pull.

84
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
I'll spread the legsas wide as I can.

85
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
Now is not the time.

86
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Count to three. One...

87
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
...two...

88
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
...three!

89
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
It worked!I scared you! I knew it!

90
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
I'm here, big guy.

91
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
There you are!

92
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
I scared you!

93
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
You did look like an idiot.

94
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
I wasn't the only onewho looked like an idiot.

95
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
Remember when Ross tried to say"butternut squash"...

96
00:05:31 --> 00:05:35
...and it came out,"squatternut bosh"?

97
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
Yeah, that's the same.

98
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
That's it.That's my worst Thanksgiving.

99
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
That can't be the one Rachel meant.

100
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
She didn't even know that happened.

101
00:05:45 --> 00:05:46
So what's yours?

102
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
I really don't wantto tell this story.

103
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54
Reliving pain and getting depressedis what Thanksgiving's all about.

104
00:05:54 --> 00:05:55
For me, anyway.

105
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
And, of course, the Indians.

106
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
Of all people, you do not want meto tell this story.

107
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
What is that supposed to mean?

108
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
Monica, I think Rachel's here!

109
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
I'll get it!

110
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
Happy Thanksgiving!

111
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Not for me.

112
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
Chip and I broke up.

113
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
Why?

114
00:06:17 --> 00:06:18
What happened?

115
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
My parents are out of town,and Chip was going to come over.

116
00:06:21 --> 00:06:22
And you were going to give him...

117
00:06:23 --> 00:06:24
...your "flower".

118
00:06:25 --> 00:06:26
Monica, can you just call it sex?

119
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
It really creeps me outwhen you call it that.

120
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
And by the way...

121
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
...while we're at it, a guy's thingis not called his "tenderness".

122
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
Believe me.

123
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
Happy Thanksgiving.

124
00:06:48 --> 00:06:48
Everyone...

125
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
...this is Chandler.

126
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
My roommate...

127
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
...and lead singer of our band.

128
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
This is Monica.

129
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
I'm Ross' little sister.

130
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
I'm so glad you could come.

131
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
We've got plenty of food,so I hope you're hungry.

132
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
Chandler hates Thanksgivingand doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.

133
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
I'm so glad you brought him here.

134
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
I can make you somemacaroni and cheese for dinner.

135
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
As long as the Pilgrimsdidn't eat it.

136
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
Damn it!

137
00:07:33 --> 00:07:34
Does it feel weird around here now?

138
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
You know, sinceI've been away at college?

139
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
Not really.

140
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
That's cool.

141
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
I cannot believe Chip dumped mefor that slut, Nancy Branson!

142
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
I am never going out with him again.I don't care how much he begs.

143
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
His begging days are over, nowthat he's with Nancy Branson.

144
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
I've just had itwith high school boys.

145
00:08:01 --> 00:08:02
They're just silly.

146
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
They're just silly, stupid boys.

147
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
I'll start dating men.

148
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
I'm sorry, Judy.

149
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
I couldn't find that bowlyou and Jack were looking for.

150
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.

151
00:08:27 --> 00:08:28
Did you likethe macaroni and cheese?

152
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
It was great.You should be a chef.

153
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Guess what?

154
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
All this stuff about Nancybeing a slut was all a rumor.

155
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
Chip dumped her, and he wantsto come over to my house!

156
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
- That is so great!- I know.

157
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
Oh, gosh. Listen,if you and Chip do it tonight...

158
00:08:47 --> 00:08:48
...promise meyou'll tell me everything?

159
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
Totally. It's not that big a deal.We already kind of did it once.

160
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
But now you'll definitely knowwhether or not you did it.

161
00:08:55 --> 00:08:56
I know.

162
00:08:56 --> 00:09:01
And Chip promised that this timeit'd last at least for an entire song.

163
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
I'm thinking of askingRachel out tonight.

164
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
Maybe playing her that songwe wrote last week.

165
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
"Emotional Knapsack"?Right on!

166
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
But don't take long.We're testing our fake I.D. S tonight.

167
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
Right, Clifford Alvarez?

168
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
Listen, Roland Cheng...

169
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
...if things go well,I may be out with her all night.

170
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
Dude, don't do that to me.

171
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
It's cool, you can stay here.My parents won't mind.

172
00:09:25 --> 00:09:30
It's not that. I just don't wantto be stuck here with your fat sister.

173
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
Why don't you finish off these pies?

174
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
I don't have any more roomin the fridge.

175
00:09:39 --> 00:09:40
No, thank you.

176
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
Judy, you did it.

177
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
She's finally full!

178
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
I called you fat?

179
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
- I don't even remember that.- Well, I do.

180
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
I'm so sorry. I really am.

181
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
I was an idiot back then.

182
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
I rushed the stage at a Wham concert,for crying out loud!

183
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
I can't believe you called her fat.

184
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
I can't believe you letGeorge Michael slap you.

185
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
I am really sorry.

186
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
That is terrible. I'm so sorry.

187
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
That's not the ThanksgivingI was talking about.

188
00:10:09 --> 00:10:09
Yes, it was.

189
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
No, it was actually...

190
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
Thanksgiving's over.Let's get ready for Christmas.

191
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
I have the cutest Christmas story.

192
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
We want to hear Monica's story.

193
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half.But, whatever.

194
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
You changed your major again?

195
00:10:27 --> 00:10:27
I had to.

196
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
There was never any parkingby the psychology building.

197
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
Love your new nose!

198
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
Dr. Wolfson's an artist.

199
00:10:37 --> 00:10:38
He removed my mole cluster.

200
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
Want to see?

201
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
No! Please, let me.

202
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
Happy Thanksgiving.

203
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Your hair sure is different.

204
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
We were just talking about that.

205
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
We can't believehow stupid we used to look.

206
00:11:00 --> 00:11:00
Where's Monica?

207
00:11:01 --> 00:11:02
She's upstairs.

208
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
Come down, everyone's here!

209
00:11:04 --> 00:11:04
Ross, Rachel...

210
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
...and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.

211
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Oh, my God!

212
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
What's the matter?

213
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
Is there something on my dress?

214
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
You look so different.

215
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
Terrific.

216
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
That dress, that body...

217
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
- Dude!- Sorry.

218
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Yes, she's thin. It's wonderful.

219
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
But we really want to hear...

220
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
...about Ross' new girlfriend.

221
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
Her name is Carol.

222
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
She's really pretty and smart.

223
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
She's on the lacrosse teamand the golf team.

224
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Can you believe it?

225
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
She plays for both teams.

226
00:11:42 --> 00:11:46
So I guess I'll see you at dinner.

227
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
- Dude!- Sorry.

228
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
Oh, my God!

229
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
That was so awesome.

230
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
You got him backfor calling you fat.

231
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
He was drooling all over you.

232
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
- That must have felt so great.- It didn't.

233
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
Yeah, I mean, I look great.

234
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
I feel great, and my heart'snot in trouble anymore.

235
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
I just don't feellike I got him back.

236
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
I just want to humiliate him.

237
00:12:08 --> 00:12:13
I want him to be naked, andI want to point at him and laugh.

238
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
That, we may be able to do.

239
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
How?

240
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
Guys tend to get nakedbefore they're going to have sex.

241
00:12:20 --> 00:12:21
What?

242
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
I didn't work this hardand lose weight...

243
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
...just so I could give my flowerto someone like him.

244
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
If you keep calling it that,no one will take it.

245
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
And then...

246
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
...you're not goingto have sex with him.

247
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
You'll just make himthink that you are.

248
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
I'll throw him outin the yard, lock the door...

249
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
...and all our neighborswill just humiliate him!

250
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
You'll definitely get him back.

251
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
How do I make him thinkI want to have sex?

252
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
Here's what you do.

253
00:12:47 --> 00:12:52
Just act like everything around youturns you on.

254
00:12:53 --> 00:12:54
What do you mean?

255
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Anything can be sexy.

256
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
Like this dish towel.

257
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
This feels so good against my cheek.

258
00:13:04 --> 00:13:08
And if I get a little hot,I can just dab myself with it.

259
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
Or I can bring it down to my sideand run it through my fingers...

260
00:13:11 --> 00:13:12
...while I talk to him.

261
00:13:12 --> 00:13:13
I can do that.

262
00:13:13 --> 00:13:14
Good, good, good.

263
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
Get busy. He's coming.

264
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
Hey, what's up?

265
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
Could you make me some of thatrighteous mac and cheese like last year?

266
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
I'd love to.

267
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
I love macaroni and cheese.

268
00:13:34 --> 00:13:38
I love the way this box feelsagainst my cheek.

269
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
And I love carrots.

270
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
Sometimes I like to put thembetween my fingers.

271
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
Like this.

272
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
And hold them down herewhile I talk to you.

273
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
And, you know, if I get really hot...

274
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
...I like to pick up this knife.

275
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
And I put the cool steel...

276
00:14:09 --> 00:14:10
...against...

277
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
...my body.

278
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
Are you all right?

279
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
I'm fine.

280
00:14:29 --> 00:14:30
Twenty-year-old male.

281
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
He's got a severed toeon his right foot.

282
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
Could you please notdo that feet first?

283
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
You know where his injury is.Severed toe, you just said it!

284
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
It says the knife wentthrough your shoe.

285
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
They're made of wicker!

286
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
Did you bring the toe?

287
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
I have it right here on ice.

288
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
Don't worry, son.We'll just reattach it and then...

289
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
What is it?

290
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
You brought a carrot.

291
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
This isn't your toe. This is a small,very cold piece of carrot.

292
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
You brought a carrot?

293
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
Oh, my God!

294
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
There's a toe in my kitchen.

295
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
I'm sorry! I'll go get it!

296
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
All we can do nowis sew up the wound.

297
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
Without my toe? I need my toe!

298
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
I can go really fast!Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.

299
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
I'm not falling for that one.

300
00:15:17 --> 00:15:21
That's why I lost my toe?Because I called you fat?

301
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
I didn't mean to cut it off.It was an accident.

302
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
That's why for an entire yearpeople called me Sir Limps-a-lot?

303
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
It wasn't your whole toe.

305
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
Yeah, well, I miss the tip.

306
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
It's the best part.

307
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
It has the nail.

308
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
Sir Limps-a-lot.

309
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
I came up with that.

310
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
You're a dork.

311
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
- I can't believe this.- I said I was sorry.

312
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
"Sorry" doesn't bring back the piggythat cried all the way home.

313
00:15:54 --> 00:15:57
I hate this stupid dayand everything about it!

314
00:15:57 --> 00:15:58
I'll see you later.

315
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
Wait.

316
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
Come here.

317
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
Is there anything I can do?Anything?

318
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
Just leave me alone for a little while.

319
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
I'm a duck.I go quack-quack.

320
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
I'm happy all the time.

321
00:16:23 --> 00:16:23
Nice try.

322
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
Wait, wait, wait.

323
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
Look, Monica...

324
00:16:32 --> 00:16:33
This is not going to work.

325
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
I bet this will work.

326
00:16:42 --> 00:16:42
You're so great.

327
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
I love you.

328
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
Nothing. I said you're so great,and then I just stopped talking.

329
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
You said you loved me.I can't believe this!

330
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
No, I didn't!

331
00:17:01 --> 00:17:02
Yes, you did!

332
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
No, I didn't!

333
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
You love me!

334
00:17:05 --> 00:17:06
No, I don't!

335
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

336
00:17:18 --> 00:17:19
Gauze!

337
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
Gauze!

338
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
I need to get some gauze in here!

339
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
Can I please get some more gauze?

340
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
This is getting ridiculous.
