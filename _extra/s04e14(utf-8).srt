So what is this?

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05

00:00:06 --> 00:00:06
And this?

4
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09

5
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
It's so funny!

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
What's this?

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
A hunk of sandwich from last year.

8
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
Geller's got one hooked!Looks like a big one!

9
00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
It's the classic strugglebetween man...

10
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
Someone knocked over a lamp.

11
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
You know what'll be greatabout the fishing trip?

12
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
When my Dad asks, "What are youdoing with your life?"...

13
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
...I can say, "I'm doing a moviewith Charlton Heston."

14
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
"What about you?"

15
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
Don't stop having funjust because I'm here.

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

17
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
Well, except you.

18
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
You shouldn't leave Chandler alone.They broke up only two days ago.

19
00:01:00 --> 00:01:01
Go fishing next week.

20
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
There's nothing I can do.He's still in his sweats.

21
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
That's only phase one.

22
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
I'll be back for phase two.I'd never miss that.

23
00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
Phase two?

24
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
Getting drunkand going to a strip club.

25
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
How does going theremake him better?

26
00:01:16 --> 00:01:18
There are naked ladies there.

27
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
Then to phase three:Seeing yourself with other women.

28
00:01:20 --> 00:01:24
There are naked ladies there too.

29
00:01:24 --> 00:01:27
Would you give me one minute, please?

30
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
The One with Joey's Dirty Day

31
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
These match the jacketyou picked out last week?

32
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
There we go.

33
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
There it is.

34
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
You know what I need?Gloves.

35
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Brown leather dress gloves.

36
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
Well, let's see...

37
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
This one is large.

38
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
And this one...

39
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
Also a large?

40
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
Two larges coming right up.

41
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
Could I have a moment?

42
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
My niece, you see,is in town from London.

43
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
Shropshire, but you know.

44
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
She's about your age, I'd say.

45
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
Die Fledermaus.

46
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
Would you like to keep hercompany tonight?

47
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
Sure. You got it!

48
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
Count me in. Me."Fledermaus." Great!

49
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
Yes, of course.Thank you so very much.

50
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
So?

51
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
- Gloves?- Sorry, I'll be right back.

52
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
Actually, I got to take off.

53
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
I was curious.Do you have plans tonight?

54
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
No, nothing!

55
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
I invested in a nightclub.It opens tonight. Want to come?

56
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
That would be great!

57
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
You're into hard-core S and M, right?

58
00:03:15 --> 00:03:16
Well, I guess.

59
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
I'm kidding.

60
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
I'll put you on the V.I.P. List.Look for me.

61
00:03:22 --> 00:03:22
Great! You bet.

62
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
I'll see you tonight.

63
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
- I almost forgot the tickets.- What?

64
00:03:27 --> 00:03:32
Die Fledermaus.

65
00:03:32 --> 00:03:32
Oh, right.

66
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
You'll like it.It has two out of the three tenors.

67
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
I can't believeKathy did this to me.

68
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
I really thought she was the one.

69
00:03:45 --> 00:03:46
I'll tell you what.

70
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
I'm not getting outof this chair. Ever!

71
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
From now on, this chair is the one!

72
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
You know what else is the one?My sweatpants.

73
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
Just take the sweats off, okay?

74
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
Take them offand we'll have some fun.

75
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
Did you catch any fish?

76
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
You guys have no idea.

77
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
- You stink!- Are you kidding?

78
00:04:08 --> 00:04:13
Three days without a shower.Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!

79
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
How's he doing?

80
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
He hasn't leftthat chair in two days.

81
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

82
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
You see? He just neededhis pal to come home.

83
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
I got to memorize my lines.

84
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
Me and Charlton Heston,bright and early tomorrow, baby!

85
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
What's the matter?

86
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
Joshua invited me to thisfancy club opening tonight.

87
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
But I already told Mr. Waltham...

88
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
...that I would take his nieceto the dumb old opera.

89
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
So what are you going to do?

90
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
- I don't know.- No! Help me!

91
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
- I can't. I have to work.- Phoebe?

92
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
I would, but I getmy morning sickness in the evening.

93
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
Unless she wants to spend the nightholding my hair back for me.

94
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
You guys, come on!I have to meet Joshua.

95
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
It's my chance for himto see the "fun" Rachel.

96
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
The "wouldn't it be greatif she were my wife?" Rachel.

97
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
Are Joey and Chandler back?

98
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
Chandler's still in phase one,and Joey's that thing you smell.

99
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
So...

100
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
Come on!

101
00:05:31 --> 00:05:32
- She's here.- Wait, wait.

102
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
Ross, please?

103
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
You want me to take some girlI've never met to the opera...

104
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
...so you can go to a cluband flirt with some guy?

105
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
That is a toughie.

106
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
She's looking down the hall.

107
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
She looked right at me.

108
00:05:47 --> 00:05:51
You can't see peoplethrough that hole, can you?

109
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
I'll be right there!Okay, Ross, please.

110
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
I thought we had moved on.

111
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
I thought we could be happyfor each other.

112
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
I mean, was that just me?

113
00:06:04 --> 00:06:05
All right, I'll do it.

114
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
Thank you, thank you.

115
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
Emily.

116
00:06:09 --> 00:06:10
I'm Rachel.

117
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Thank goodness!

118
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
There's been a teeny change of plans.I'm not free tonight...

119
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
Really?

120
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
I must've missed your call, thoughI didn't leave the flat all day.

121
00:06:21 --> 00:06:21
Well, I...

122
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
That's not rude.It's in keeping with the trip...

123
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
...where I've been run downby one of your wiener carts...

124
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
...and been strip-searchedat the airport.

125
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
Apparently, I look like someone who'sgot cocaine stuffed up their bum.

126
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
I think you look great.

127
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
Good night.It was very nice to meet you.

128
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
I'll get her.

129
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Please, hurry.

130
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
Don't you just lovethe way they talk?

131
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
- What?- The baby kicked!

132
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
No, wait. The elasticin my underwear busted.

133
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
Oh, my God! I overslept!

134
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
I was supposed to beon the set half an hour ago!

135
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
You can't go like that!You stink!

136
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
I fell asleep.Now I don't have time!

137
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
Just 10 blocks away.If I run, I'll make it.

138
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
Run 10 blocks.That'll help the smell.

139
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
Slow down!No, keep moving.

140
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
How did it go last night?

141
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
Well, I didn't see Joshua.

142
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
But I did punch a girl in the face.

143
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
The whole night was horrible.It was pouring.

144
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
There was no Rachel Greene on the list.But there was a Rachel Greep.

145
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
So did you get to meet her?

146
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
There is no Rachel Greep.But this girl overheard us.

147
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
And she said, "I'm Rachel Greep!"And he let her in.

148
00:07:44 --> 00:07:45
So you hit her?

149
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
No, she was already in.

150
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
This big bitch behind metried to steal my umbrella...

151
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
...so I clocked her.

152
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
All I wanted was a few hours...

153
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
...outside of work to see Joshua...

154
00:07:57 --> 00:08:01
...so he could go ahead andstart falling in love with me.

155
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
Pheebs.

156
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
Honey, that's your name.

157
00:08:07 --> 00:08:12
That's short for Phoebe? I thoughtthat's what we called each other.

158
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
- You're wearing pants!- That's right.

159
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
Where are the guys? I'm readyto get drunk and see strippers.

160
00:08:18 --> 00:08:19
It's 9:30 a.m.

161
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
They got a breakfast buffet.

162
00:08:24 --> 00:08:25
Let me talk to him!

163
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
- Oh, my God!- Can't I just...

164
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
- It's my phone and she's shush...- Please!

165
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
What's he saying?

166
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
He's with Emily in Vermont.

167
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
What? Oh, my God!

168
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
Who's Emily?

169
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
They're in Vermont?How did this happen?

170
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
How'd he end up in Vermontwith that witch?

171
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Maybe she doesn't hit himall the time.

172
00:08:49 --> 00:08:49
When we met her...

173
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
...she was soaking, her feet were wet.Who wouldn't be miserable?

174
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
With a dry pair of shoes,she was a totally different person.

175
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
There's a deer outsideeating fruit from the orchard!

176
00:08:59 --> 00:09:04
I got to go! There's a deereating fruit from the orchard!

177
00:09:04 --> 00:09:09
He had to go. There was a deereating fruit from the orchard.

178
00:09:09 --> 00:09:10
I don't get this.She was horrible!

179
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
I'm going to go stand over there.

180
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
Why do you care?

181
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
I don't care.

182
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
I'm just upset thatI'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

183
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
You do not just meet someoneand go flitting off to Vermont!

184
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
When you first met Barry,you flitted off to Vail.

185
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
Could you, just for once...

186
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
...not remember every little thing?

187
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
So you know, when's he getting back?

188
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
A couple of days.

189
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
I knew somethinglike this would happen.

190
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
What are you doing?

191
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
You can't go back a phase!

192
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
You're thinking about time.You can't go back in time.

193
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
Why don't you do your phase twostrip club thing with us?

194
00:09:51 --> 00:09:52
We can be guys!

195
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
No, you can't.

196
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
Let us be guys!Maybe we want to be guys.

197
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
No, you don't. You'd be allhairy and wouldn't live as long.

198
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
Would you just stop beingsuch a wuss and get those off?

199
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
And come with usand watch naked girls dance!

200
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
Joey Tribbianni.I'm here.

202
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
Calm down, we got time.We're running late.

203
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
Look at that.Charlton Heston eating licorice.

204
00:10:29 --> 00:10:34
Yeah, he loves them.I've never seen him with...

205
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
What the hell is that?What smells so bad?

206
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
You.

207
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44
I could see why you would think that.But you know who it is?

208
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
You?

209
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
No, no. It's Heston.

210
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
What?

211
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
He reeks like he went on a three-dayfishing trip, then ate licorice.

212
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
No way. He's the only onewith a shower in his dressing room.

213
00:10:58 --> 00:10:59
Really? A shower?

214
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
Which room might that be?

215
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
The one with "Heston" on it.

216
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
Interesting.

217
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
I got some ones.You want to put them in her panties?

218
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22
No, thanks, Mom!

219
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
That.

220
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
You have to put that outbecause I'm pregnant.

221
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
Maybe you and your babyought to go to another strip club.

222
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
It's not my baby.

223
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
Very good.

224
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
Really good. I enjoyed it.Very exotic.

225
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
I just checked our messagesand Joshua didn't call.

226
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
You'd think he'd be worriedabout me not showing up.

227
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
You know what makes it worse?

228
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
Ross is all happy in Vermont.

229
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
Come on, look where you are!

230
00:11:56 --> 00:11:57
Another round.

231
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
Virgin for me.

232
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
Don't let me leave withoutthe name of that carpet guy.

233
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
Come on!

234
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
You know what?I'll go home and call Kathy.

235
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
If it'll help.

236
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
That was a test.In a few hours, I'll be drunk.

237
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
I'll want to call her.You'll have to stop me.

238
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
Then I'll be so drunk,I'll want to call Janice.

239
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
You should! How is she?

240
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
I think somebody needsanother lap dance.

241
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
Who's in there?

242
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
How you doing?

243
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
Who in the hell are you?

244
00:12:43 --> 00:12:47
Would you believe meif I said I was Kirk Douglas?

245
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
Put some pants on, kid,so I can kick your butt.

246
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
No, wait. You don't understand.

247
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
I'm an actor.

248
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Joey Tribbiani.I'm doing a scene with you today.

249
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
And I stink!

250
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
You're in this picture?

251
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
I'm a cop who won't work with youbecause you're a loose cannon.

252
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

253
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
But I stink.

254
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
Joey, right?

255
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
Every actor, one time or another...

256
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
Every actor thinks he stinks.

257
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
Even Laurence Oliviersometimes thought he stank.

258
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
Bob Redford won't even watch himself.

259
00:13:25 --> 00:13:25
You don't understand.

260
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
Listen to me.

261
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
I don't know one actorworth his salt...

262
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
...who, one time in his career,didn't say, "God, I stink!"

263
00:13:34 --> 00:13:39
I just did a scene out there.First take, I stunk the place up.

264
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
The important thing,and you must remember...

265
00:13:42 --> 00:13:44
...no matter how badlyyou think you stink...

266
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
...you must never, ever bust intomy dressing room and use my shower!

267
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
Do you understand me?

268
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
- Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.- Wait a minute!

269
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
Take your pants.

270
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
We did okayat the strip club, right?

271
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
Great. Thanks to you,the hottest waitress is quitting...

272
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
...to teach the third grade!

273
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
He still hasn't called.

274
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
Who, Josh?

275
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
It's Joshua.

276
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
- He doesn't like "Josh"?- No, I don't.

277
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
I'm going to put my sweats back on.

278
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
You know what?You were right.

279
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
We weren't great at being guys.You know why?

280
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
Because we're girls.

281
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
You know what girls are good at?

282
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
Stripping!

283
00:14:26 --> 00:14:27
No, listening!

284
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
Sit.

285
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
Maybe it would really, really helpif you would just talk.

286
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
Yeah, come on.What's going on in there?

287
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
And you know, if you want to cry,that's okay too.

288
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
I'm going to haveto ask you all to leave.

289
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
Forget it. We tried,but phase three is a lost cause.

290
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
Those strippers were hot, and Icouldn't picture myself with them.

291
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
They really were pretty,weren't they?

292
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
- I liked that fighter pilot one.- Candy?

293
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
She was so spunky!

294
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
I think if I were goingto be with a woman...

295
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
...it'd be with someonelike Michelle.

296
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
She was just so petite.

297
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
For me, it would have to be Chantal.

298
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
She had the smoothest skin.

299
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
When I stuck that dollar inher G-string and grazed her thigh...

300
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
Phase three!I just achieved phase three!

301
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
I am totally picturing youwith all those women!

302
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
That's not phase three.

303
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
Well, I'm there too!

304
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33
Are we all together in a group?

305
00:15:34 --> 00:15:35
Stop it, you're killing me!

306
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
I think I moved on to phase four!

307
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
What is that?

308
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
I don't want a relationship ever!

309
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
I just want sexwith strippers and my friends!

310
00:15:45 --> 00:15:46
Come on.

311
00:15:47 --> 00:15:48
Let me see that smile.

312
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
I don't want to.

313
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
Please?

314
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
I wanted to go to the strip club!

315
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
You'll have plenty of chances.

316
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
There are thousands of women out there,just waiting to screw me over.

317
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
Yeah, all right.

318
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
How was Vermont?

319
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
Emily is...

320
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
...incredible. There areno words to describe her.

321
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
The whole weekend was like a dream.

322
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
And you! Rach!

323
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
You were so right.

324
00:16:18 --> 00:16:18
What?

325
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
What you said about usfinally being in a place...

326
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
...where we could reallybe happy for each other.

327
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
I admit, I wasn't quite there.

328
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
The thought of youand that Josh guy...

329
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
Joshua.

330
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
- Joshua guy at that club,dancing, having a good time.

331
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
And the thought of it kind of...

332
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
You know? But now!

333
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
But now, I'm totally there.

334
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
I'm finally where you are.

335
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
Thank goodness!

336
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
And thank you for Emily.

337
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
No problem.I'm so glad I could help, you know?

338
00:16:51 --> 00:16:52
I'm happy for you.

339
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
Happy for you.

340
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
Oh no, happy for you.

341
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
All right. Here's what we'll do.

342
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
You are going to take offmy clothes.

343
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
You two, go get the oils.

344
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
And you, just constantly scream...

345
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
..."Chandler's the king!Chandler's the king!"

346
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
I want to be with her.I like her.

347
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
That's fine.Go with your instincts!

348
00:17:14 --> 00:17:15
What am I doing again?

349
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
Pay attention.I could wake up at any moment.

350
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
I'm Joshua.I'm here to pick up Rachel.

351
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
That's not Joshua.

352
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
What do you want from me?I never met the guy.

353
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
I'm sorry you can't stay.

354
00:17:27 --> 00:17:31
The rest of ushave a lot of work to do.

355
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
What are you doing?

356
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
All right, listen.I got to wake up.
