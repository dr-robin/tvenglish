Friends Season3_episode20 - The One With The PollHouse Rip & Subtitle by『조그셔틀』™ Create Date : 02/12/2004 -->   그 여자가 너에게 반하지 않은 유일한 여배우란 말야?

2
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,274
그래! 잠깐

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,843
거기엔 너도 포함되지?

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,639
많이 좋아하나 봐?

5
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:17,915
상상도 못할 거야

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,282
함께 무대에 서면 키스하고 안고 싶어져

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,116
감독과 집에 가는 모습을 보고 있으면

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,416
내 맘이 찢어진다구

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,325
그런 심정을 안다니 정말 잘됐어

10
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,623
- 안녕 - 어서 와

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,063
아버지 전화를 받았는데...

12
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,362
실비아 이모가 돌아가셨대

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,205
정말! 정말! 좋다!

14
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,847
다들 흥분에 떨고 있어

15
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,783
뭔가 잘못된 거 아냐? 죽음이란 건 슬픈 일이잖아

16
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,715
실비아 이모가 그리 좋은 분이 아니었어

17
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,416
냉정하고, 괴팍한 분이었지

18
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,392
돌아가신 건 안 됐어

19
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,567
- 아빠가 인형 집은 보내셨대? - 곧 도착한대

20
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,862
나도 인형 집을 갖는다!

21
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,104
인형이 살 집? 멋지다

22
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,304
난 어릴 적에, 통이 있었어

23
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,374
인형을 통에 넣었어?

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,082
그냥 통만 있었어

25
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,121
인형 집이 오면 우리 같이 놀아

26
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,378
정말? 정말?

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,579
언제든지

28
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,851
어릴 적 소원이 인형 집을 갖는 거였어

29
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,356
물론, 지금은 감상용이지 갖고 놀 생각은 없어

30
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,198
우리 할머니도 똑같은 말씀을 하셨지

31
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,315
- 나 왔어, 소피 - 왔어

32
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,079
안녕하세요?

33
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,084
점심 잘 먹었어

34
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,224
여기까지 바래다 줄 필요는 없는데

35
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,455
괜찮아, 그냥 온 거야

36
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,397
사무실에 여자 란제리를 걸어놓진 않아

37
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,334
응, 지금 봤어

38
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,331
- 여름 카탈로그야 - 바로 이거야

39
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,241
베르사체 송장이 어딨지?

40
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,843
안녕하세요? 직원은 아니시죠?

41
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,380
과장님 제 친구 챈들러 빙이에요

42
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,608
조애너 과장님

43
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,051
빙? 재밌는 이름이군요

44
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,879
게일족 말로 '너의 칠면조가 다 됐다'래요

45
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,758
이제 갈게요 반가웠습니다

46
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,293
- 저두요 - 잘 가, 챈들러

47
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,233
사람이 원래 저래?

48
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,801
원래 좀 맹해 보이지만 저는 이제 거의 모르겠어요

49
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,433
아니, 좋단 뜻이야

50
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,711
혹시 기혼자거나 애인이 있나?

51
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,642
아뇨, 미혼이고 애인도 없어요

52
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,282
레이첼... 있잖아 아냐, 됐어

53
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,922
- 원하시면 제가 물어볼게요 - 그럴래?

54
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,617
그래도 너무 몸 달은 것처럼 하지마, 소피처럼 말이야

55
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,124
저 여기 있어요

56
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:51,956
알아

57
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,629
이것 봐!

58
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,070
벽지가 좀 어둡지만... 괜찮아

59
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,502
카페트가 좀 낡았네

60
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,207
바닥이 나무야!

61
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,774
- 안녕 - 왔니?

62
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,140
모니카! 너무 아름답다

63
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,341
그래!

64
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,951
- 내가 준비해왔어 - 좋아

65
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,752
이 집을 위해서 준비했어 어디 보자

66
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:26,994
이게 뭐야?

67
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,535
개야, 집마다 개가 있잖아

68
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,198
지붕에다 오줌싸라구?

69
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,937
방사성 폐기물 위에 세워진 집이라 변종이 된 거야

70
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,239
집이 재채기도 하니?

71
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,513
아냐, 그건 다락방의 유령이야

72
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,615
난 유령 싫어

73
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,617
유령은 누구나 싫어해

74
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,956
그래도 이 집엔 있어

75
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,925
이 집이 고대 인디안 묘지 자리에 지어졌거든

76
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:10,069
이 집이 방사성 폐기물과 고대 인디안 묘지에 있는 거야?

77
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,608
그건 말도 안 돼

78
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,881
넌 미국 정부가 어떤지 몰라

79
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,250
- 안녕 - 안녕

80
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,149
우리 얘기 좀 해

81
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,653
그래, 뭔데?

82
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,456
미안, 챈들러에게 한 말이야

83
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,955
알고 있어

84
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,130
그래도 혹시나...

85
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,235
너희가 덜 어색한 단계로 접어든 걸 축하해

86
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,133
조애너 과장 알지?

87
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,675
네가 나가자마자 너에 대해서 묻더라

88
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,078
잠깐 본 건데?

89
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,477
내 행동은 어떻대?

90
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,823
챈챈맨의 위력을 보시라!

91
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:03,587
너무...

92
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,294
초현실적이다

93
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,897
어때? 관심 있니?

94
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,195
응, 괜찮아 보이더라 매력도 있고, 나야 좋지

95
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,033
고마워, 잘됐다 과장님한테 잘 보일 거야

96
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,873
공룡의 공격이다! 모두 집안으로 들어가!

97
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,883
피비, 됐어 그만 하자

98
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:29,614
공룡도, 유령도 거인 개도 됐어

99
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:33,485
크기도 안 맞고, 빅토리아풍과 안 어울려

100
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,322
알았어, 됐어

101
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:39,962
가자, 공룡아

102
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,361
상상력이 없는 집은 우리도 필요 없어

103
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,070
피비, 전문가 입장에서 말하는 건데....

104
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,934
공룡과는 손 붙잡고 가지마

105
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,039
작은 건 괜찮아

106
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,746
- 케이트 - 좋은 아침!

107
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,287
지난주에 말해준 그 식당에 갔었어요

108
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,122
귀염둥이! 이리 와요 얘기 좀 합시다

109
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,464
식사했죠, 맛있었어요 생선요리였죠, 좋았어요

110
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,531
안녕하세요

111
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,068
로렌이에요 케이트 보조 대역이죠

112
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,207
조이 트리비아니예요

113
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,942
알아요, 당신 팬이에요

114
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,234
네?

115
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,348
라모레이 박사를 보느라고 수업 시간도 바꾸고 그랬죠

116
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,644
'우리의 날들'이요

117
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,678
- 정말이에요? - 물론이죠

118
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,419
그런데 엘리베이터에 끼어 죽게 한 건 너무했어요

119
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,116
아주 설득력 있는 죽음이죠

120
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,162
어머, 너무 재밌네요

121
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:50,366
리허설 끝나고 뭐 하세요? 술이라도 한잔 하실래요?

122
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,797
그게...

123
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,172
좋아요, 술 한잔 좋죠

124
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,106
좋아요

125
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,779
- 그럼 있다 봬요 - 그래요

126
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,212
이제 연기를 해봅시다

127
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,116
한번 떠들어봐요!

128
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,689
- 안녕 - 안녕

129
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,262
이것 봐라 내 인형 집이야

130
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,102
봐, 봐!

131
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,968
이게 뭐야?

132
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,712
미끄럼 계단이야, 봐

133
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,180
아주 재밌다, 피비

134
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,081
이건 뭐야?

135
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,947
약초 방이야 먹을 수 있는 가구지

136
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,655
손님이 오면 접는 침대를 펴면 돼

137
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,456
지금까지 본 것 중에 최고다!

138
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,866
아로마 방에 가고 싶은 사람?

139
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,833
- 저요 - 저요

140
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:05,168
여길 봐, 내 장식장 봤어?

141
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,878
이거 봐!

142
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,874
이것도!

143
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,185
우리 아빠 집도 저랬어

144
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,223
좋아! 어땠는지 말해봐

145
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:29,924
영화 좋았고, 식사 좋았고 쌀쌀한 뉴욕의 밤 분위기 좋고!

146
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,772
근데 난 그걸 즐길 수 없었어 조애너 같은 여자는 처음이다

147
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,509
챈들러, 너무 좋아!

148
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,211
네?

149
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,108
우린 천생연분이야 그게 어떤지 알지?

150
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,442
그가 날 데리러 옴과 동시에 내가 문을 열었어

151
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,080
- 그런 말 안 해? - 저는...

152
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,313
게다가 너무 착해 정말 착하지 않아?

153
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,014
- 저는... - 그래, 너무 좋은 사람이야

154
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,422
전화한다고 했으니까 바로 바꿔 줘

155
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,821
- 정말 잘 됐네요 - 기분 깨지마

156
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,063
여보, 제발 가지마 안 떠날 거지?

157
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:10,307
여보세요? 당신이군 잠깐만

158
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,909
전화를 받고 올테니까

159
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:22,510
그때는 이 극장 무대에 매혹적인 게 보이길 바래요

160
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,087
순간에 전념해요!

161
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,894
괴상하지 않아요?

162
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,089
당신은 못 느껴요?

163
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,134
좋을 때도 있잖아요

164
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,595
당신이 데이트하는 저 스웨터 보단 낫죠

165
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,301
난 스웨터엔 관심 없어요

166
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,769
스웨터 속이 중요하죠

167
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:54,075
언제부터 남의 데이트 상대에 신경을 썼죠?

168
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,288
난 신경 안 써요 신경 써주길 원해요?

169
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,652
신경 써주길 원하길 원해요?

170
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:01,887
당신은요?

171
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:03,661
뭐요?

172
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,564
이렇게 말하긴 두렵지만, 하던 거 계속합시다

173
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,076
여보, 제발 가지마 안 떠날 거지?

174
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,276
있어야 할 이유가 없어요

175
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:29,478
그만! 그만해! 제발 그만해!

176
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,655
당신들 연기는 끔찍스러워

177
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,622
각본도 끔찍해!

178
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,427
내일 아침에 봅시다

179
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,198
1주일 밖에 안 남았어요

180
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,905
할 수 있을 거예요

181
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,567
오늘 일찍 끝났으니까 머그컵 색칠하러 갈래요?

182
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,079
네?

183
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,874
어제 말씀 드린 곳이요

184
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,149
그래요, 컵에 색칠하는 곳이요

185
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,855
아주 잘 기억하죠?

186
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,796
근데 오늘은 남아서 연습해야겠어요

187
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,697
알았어요 내일 만나요

188
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,101
그래요

189
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:20,501
먼저 갈게요

190
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:27,744
괜찮아요?

191
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,680
네, 괜찮아요

192
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,508
이 장면을 어떻게 하죠?

193
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,416
모르겠어요

194
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,619
좀 더 극적인 게 필요해요

195
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:43,687
어쩌면 되죠?

196
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,093
아내는 남을 이유를 찾고 싶어하죠

197
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,164
남편은 키스도 못해요

198
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,433
그는 아내에게 이유를 찾아줘야 돼요

199
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,839
찐한 키스는 어떨까요?

200
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,212
아니면... 여자를 잡고

201
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,017
번쩍 들어올려요

202
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,156
좋아요, 그럼 아내가 다리로 남편의 허리를 감죠

203
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,588
남편의 옷을 찢고 그의 가슴에 입을 맞추죠

204
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,289
남편은 입으로 아내의 드레스를 벗겨요

205
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,933
그리고 콱 깨물죠!

206
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:29,773
네, 결국... 거칠고 동물적인...

207
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,336
이렇게요?

208
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,412
내 생각과 거의 비슷해요

209
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,346
네

210
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:56,897
- 왔냐? - 안녕

211
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,308
아침부터 술 마셨니?

212
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,741
아니 결국 케이트와 일을 냈다

213
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,484
- 정말? 잘 됐다 - 그래

214
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,644
너무 놀라웠어 사랑을 나눈 뒤에...

215
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:17,753
세상에

216
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,719
몇 시간 동안 자는 모습을 지켜봤어

217
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,624
숨을 들이쉬고, 내쉬고...

218
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,627
꿈을 꾸고 있었나봐 눈이 이렇게 움직였거든

219
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,568
조애너와 안 맞아 내가 한 말이라곤...

220
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,772
"재밌네요, 또 옵시다 전화할게요"

221
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,348
이런! 그래서 전화 올 거라는 말을 했구나?

222
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,287
데이트 끝엔 누구나 하잖아

223
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,219
반가웠어요, 잘 가요 그랬어야지

224
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,225
그 얼굴에 대고?

225
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,192
헤어질 때쯤, 뭔가를 기다리는 듯한 분위기에

226
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,062
'전화할게요'가 저절로 튀어나오더라

227
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,262
어쩔 수 없었어 강박을 느낄 정도였어

228
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:13,175
남자가 전화한단 말이 꼭 한다는 건 아니잖아

229
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,137
넌 그런 적 없어?

230
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,714
난 늘 받았어

231
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,008
잘났어

232
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:27,887
전화 왔어?

233
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,424
아뇨, 죄송해요

234
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:33,064
왜? 한다고 해놓고 왜 전화를 안 하는 거야?

235
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:37,293
똑똑하고, 강하고, 성공한 여자 기피증이 있나봐요

236
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,400
소피, 말참견 좀 하지 마

237
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,370
- 전화를 왜 안 한 대? - 그게, 아마도...

238
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:50,139
제 상관이라는 게 부담스러웠나봐요

239
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,409
- 부담? 무슨 부담을 느껴? - 그게...

240
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,076
부담스러운 건 레이첼 아냐? 그래서 전화하지 말랬지?

241
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:56,617
아뇨!

242
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:01,749
직장 상사와 친구의 데이트가 불편하면 방법을 찾아봐야지

243
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,425
전화해, 당장!

244
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,528
한 마리 매처럼 채가네

245
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,705
왜 전화 안 하지? 왜? 왜?

246
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,205
이해할 수 없어, 왜? 한다고 했는데, 왜지?

247
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,572
과장이 잔뜩 골이 나있어! 화가 났다구!

248
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,009
- 그럼 전화기 줘 - 지금 웃을 기분 아냐

249
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,981
과장은 내 책임이라고 생각하니까, 빨리 해

250
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:33,181
막무가내로 부탁 아닌 명령을 하는 사람의 말을 들으라구?

251
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,284
아님, 같이 외출이라도 해

252
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,291
싫어! 정말 지루한 여자야

253
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,762
속눈썹에 마스카라 덩어리도 묻히고 다녀

254
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,195
상관없어! 상관없어!

255
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,932
한번 더 데이트하고서 진짜 확실하게 끝내버려

256
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:55,170
아무리 어쩔 수 없다해도 절대로 전화한단 말 하지마

257
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,345
좋아, 알았어

258
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,710
이번은 점심 데이트야 1시간 이상은 못해

259
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,113
이제 내 짝은 내가 찾아 절대로 여자 소개하지마

260
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,286
그거 좋지!

261
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,415
- 우리 소리 좀 크지 않니? - 알아

262
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,023
모니카?

263
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,386
샤워 중이야

264
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,278
불이야! 불이야!

265
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,776
- 안녕 - 안녕

266
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,142
로렌과 얘길 했는데, 우리 사이를 밝혔어요

267
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,286
당신은 감독한테 말했어요?

268
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:10,950
무슨 얘기요?

269
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,819
지난 밤 얘기요

270
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,060
아뇨

271
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,626
그 사람이 알아야 할 이유가 없어요

272
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,060
별 일 아니었잖아요

273
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,270
그게 무슨 뜻이죠? 그건 별 일이에요

274
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,473
지난밤 일이 별 거 아니란 말은 말아요

275
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,444
분명 일어난 일이고, 당신도 그리 훌륭한 배우는 아니죠

276
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,545
그건... 순간적으로 일어난 거였어요

277
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,084
그뿐이에요

278
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,287
기분 나빴다면 미안해요

279
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,596
자고 나서, 그것의 의미가 다른 적도 있지 않아요?

280
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,260
아뇨

281
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,397
- 안녕, 케이트 - 안녕, 로렌

282
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,302
안녕, 로렌

283
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:02,738
나쁜 놈!

284
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,046
- 놀래켜서 미안해 - 괜찮아

285
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,781
아무튼, 난 샤워기를 손보고 있었어

286
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,088
알아

287
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,788
안녕

288
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,222
직장에 전화했었어 집에 불이 났어

289
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,459
뭐? 어머... 맙소사!

290
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,601
어떻게 된 거야?

291
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,863
화재가 발생한 곳은 여깁니다

292
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,736
아로마 룸이죠

293
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,677
대피는 잘 했어?

294
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,247
기린은 괜찮고, 해적도 괜찮아

295
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,941
이게 뭐니?

296
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,119
피비, 안돼 그거 안 보는 게 나을걸!

297
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,955
입양한 인형인데!

298
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,197
괜찮아요, 그냥 보여서요 자꾸 보이거든요

299
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,232
점심 잘 먹었어요

300
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,608
저도 즐거웠습니다

301
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,078
그렇죠?

302
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,212
- 음식도 맛있었죠 - 그렇죠?

303
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,184
그럼, 잘 있어요

304
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,380
당신도요

305
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,019
즐거웠고, 전화 드리죠 언제 또 봅시다

306
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,361
좋아요, 기다리죠

307
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,129
- 레이첼, 전화 메모는? - 소피 책상에요

308
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,999
챈들러! 전화할 거야?

309
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,630
- 아니 - 챈들러?

310
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,543
미안해, 나약하고 덜 떨어져서 미안해

311
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,246
솔직히 말해, 지금 하라구

312
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,710
저... 전화 안할래요

313
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,218
네?

314
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,751
죄송해요

315
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,389
생각도 없이 한다고 해서 죄송해요

316
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:07,355
당신이 문제가 있어서가 아니고, 레이첼 잘못도 아니죠

317
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,692
제가 여자에 있어서 심각한 문제가 있어요

318
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,929
책임감이나 친밀감에 문제가 있고...

319
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,005
마스카라 덩어리도요

320
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:25,406
정말 죄송하지만 계속 만날 수가 없어요

321
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:35,317
이런 식으로 끝나는 건 싫지만 솔직하게 말해주니 고맙군요

322
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,458
네... 그래요

323
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,292
그럼...

324
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,426
즐거웠고, 전화 드리죠 언제 또 봅시다

325
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,706
어쨌든, 베스

326
00:21:55,314 --> 00:22:00,479
너희 집에 갔을 때 네 기분을 몰랐단 거야

327
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:07,322
내가 요즘 여자들 입장이 돼보는 중이거든, 미안해

328
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,058
날 용서할 수 있겠어?

329
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,589
그래, 고마워 그럼 잘 있어

330
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,107
제니퍼?

331
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,144
로리오 부인! 제니퍼 있어요?

332
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,149
나갔군요?

333
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,243
사실, 부인께도 드릴 말씀이 있어요

334
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,462
You're telling me this actress person...

335
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:08,834
...is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?

336
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,904
Oh, my God.

337
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,509
Is this what it's like to be you?

338
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,183
-You're crazy about her, huh? -You have no idea.

339
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:22,377
When we're on stage, I get to kiss her and touch her.

340
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,213
She goes home with the director...

341
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,358
...and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart.

342
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:30,221
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this.

343
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,832
Dad called this morning.

344
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,236
Aunt Sylvia passed away.

345
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,740
We were all pretty shaken up about it.

346
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,142
Am I missing something?

347
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,251
I thought death was supposed to be sad, in a way.

348
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,482
Well, Aunt Sylvia was...

349
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,089
... not a nice person.

350
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,158
She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

351
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,527
And I'm sorry she died.

352
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,393
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

353
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,829
-You get the dollhouse. -I get the dollhouse!

354
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,504
A house for dolls! That is so cool.

355
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,076
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.

356
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,405
You had a barrel for a dollhouse?

357
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,878
No, just a barrel.

358
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,211
You know what? You can play with my dollhouse.

359
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,319
Really?

360
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,885
Any time you want.

361
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,094
When I was young I wanted to play with this dollhouse.

362
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,627
But no! It was to be looked at, never played with.

363
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,332
My grandmother said the same thing to me.

364
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,998
The One With the Doll House

365
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,153
Thanks for lunch. You didn't have to walk me here.

366
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,153
That's okay. No problem.

367
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,522
You realize we don't keep the women's lingerie here.

368
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,038
Yes, I realize that.

369
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,205
-Summer catalog. -That's the stuff.

370
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,105
Rachel, I need the Versace invoice.

371
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,811
You don't work for me.

372
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,085
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing. Joanna.

373
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,877
Bing? That's a great name.

374
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,817
It's Gaelic for, "Thy turkey's done."

375
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,626
-I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you. -You too.

376
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,434
So what's wrong with him?

377
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:27,265
Nothing. He's just goofy like that. I actually hardly notice it anymore.

378
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,801
I mean, is he married or involved with anyone?

379
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,112
He's not married or involved with anyone.

380
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,249
Actually, you know what? Forget it.

381
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,957
-I'll ask him for you, if you want. -Would you?

382
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,889
Or is it too sad and desperate, like something Sophie would do?

383
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,461
-I am here. -I know that.

384
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,025
Look at it!

385
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,068
Wallpaper's a little faded. That's okay.

386
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,740
Carpet's a little loose.

387
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,375
Hardwood floors?!

388
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,375
-It's so beautiful! -I know!

389
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,754
So I'm here, ready to play!

390
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:22,684
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out.

391
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,355
What's this?

392
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000
That's a dog. Every house should have a dog.

393
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,367
Not one that can pee on the roof.

394
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:39,571
Maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.

395
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:45,045
And is this in case the house sneezes?

396
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,512
No, that's the ghost for the attic.

397
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,253
-I don't want a ghost. -Well, nobody wants a ghost.

398
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,262
But you've got one...

399
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,560
... because the house is sitting on an ancient lndian burial ground.

400
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,633
Wait a minute. The house was built on radioactive waste...

401
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,206
...and an ancient lndian burial ground?

402
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,809
That would never happen.

403
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,780
Obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.

404
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,956
-I need to talk to you. -Sure. What's up?

405
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,590
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.

406
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,561
I know.

407
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,324
Well, if something comes up....

408
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,802
I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.

409
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,638
My boss. Joanna. When you left...

410
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,473
...she started asking questions about you....

411
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,343
Liked what she saw?

412
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,747
Dug my action, did she?

413
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,981
Checking out the Chan Chan Man!

414
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,291
That was...

415
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,465
...surreal.

416
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,825
What do you think? Are you interested?

417
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,468
She seemed cool. Attractive. I'll do it.

418
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,200
Thank you, Chandler. This is great. She's gonna love me.

419
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:21,174
Dinosaur attack! Quick, everybody into the house!

420
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,610
All right, Phoebe, you know what? That's it. That's it.

421
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,014
No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay?

422
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,157
They're not the right size, they're not Victorian and they don't go.

423
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,295
Fine.

424
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:43,496
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome in the house of no imagination.

425
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:48,299
While we're on the subject, I have to say that dinosaurs...

426
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,409
...they don't go, "ruff!"

427
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,708
The little ones do.

428
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,756
-Hey, Kate. -Morning.

429
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,321
I went to that restaurant you talked about

430
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,822
Hey, lovely.

431
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,358
Come, talk to me for a minute.

432
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,292
I ate the food. It was good. I had the fish.

433
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,965
I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.

434
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,129
Joey Tribbiani.

435
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,504
I know.

436
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,506
I'm a big fan of yours.

437
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,734
What?

438
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,311
I used to schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...

439
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,076
...on Days of our Lives.

440
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,084
-Get out of here. Really? -Absolutely.

441
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,424
But then they dropped you down that elevator shaft.

442
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,353
They gave me the shaft, all right.

443
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,222
You're so funny.

444
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,358
What are you doing after rehearsal?

445
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,535
You want to get a drink?

446
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,201
Sure. A drink sounds great.

447
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,471
-Cool. I'll see you then. -All right.

448
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,418
All right. It's time to act, my talking props.

449
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,159
Look everybody! Look at my new dollhouse!

450
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,430
Look, look!

451
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,307
Hey, what's this?

452
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,412
It's a slide instead of stairs. Look.

453
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,280
Very interesting, Phoebe.

454
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,249
What's this?

455
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:45,082
The licorice room. You can eat all the furniture.

456
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,458
And when guests come over, they can stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.

457
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,362
This is the coolest house ever!

458
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,534
Does anyone want to join me in the Aroma Room?

459
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,465
-All right. -I would.

460
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,697
Hey, guys? Guys!

461
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,204
Did you see my new china cabinet?

462
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,341
Watch. Watch.

463
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,280
And? And?

464
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,319
Hey, my father's house does that.

465
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,328
How did it go? Tell me everything!

466
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,826
The movie was great...

467
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,729
...dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.

468
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,737
Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that because Joanna's such a dull dud!

469
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,973
Chandler is fantastic!

470
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,211
-What? -You know how people just click?

471
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,681
He came by to pick me up, I opened the door and it was just like, "click!"

472
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,351
Did he tell you?

473
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,250
Doesn't he have a good heart?

474
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,358
And he's so sweet. He said he'd call, so put him straight through.

475
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,653
-lsn't this great? -Don't spoil it.

476
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,160
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?

477
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,733
What do you say?

478
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,498
It's you. Just one sec.

479
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,009
I'm going to take this call.

480
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,410
When I continue, I hope there will appear on-stage...

481
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:23,178
...this magical thing that in the theater we call...

482
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,391
...committing to the moment!

483
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,928
The guy's like a cartoon.

484
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,631
What do you see in him, anyway?

485
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,301
He happens to be brilliant.

486
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,596
Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.

487
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,570
I'm not interested in her sweater.

488
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,971
It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.

489
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,116
And besides...

490
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,113
...since when do you care who I'm with?

491
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,253
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?

492
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,823
Do you want me to want you to care?

493
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,726
Do you?

494
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,229
What?

495
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,597
Okay. I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick up where we left off.

496
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,301
Come on, baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?

497
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,979
I've got no reason to stay.

498
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,809
Stop!

499
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,646
Stop it! You must stop!

500
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,153
You are bad actors!

501
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,962
This is a terrible play!

502
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,495
I'll see you in the morning.

503
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,299
I can't believe we go on in a week.

504
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,038
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

505
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,775
Since we're getting off early, do you want to go paint mugs?

506
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,941
What?

507
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,951
At the place I told you about last night?

508
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,216
Yeah, with the mug-painting.

509
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,788
I was so listening to that.

510
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,862
But you know what? I need to work on my stuff tonight.

511
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,661
I'll see you tomorrow.

512
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,637
Are you okay?

513
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,315
I guess.

514
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,485
What are we gonna do about the scene?

515
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,914
I don't know.

516
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,389
Maybe if it had more heat.

517
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,696
Well, how do you mean?

518
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,763
Adrianne's looking for a reason to stay, right?

519
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,993
Victor can't just kiss her. He's gotta...

520
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,603
... he's gotta give her a reason.

521
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,599
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

522
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,243
Or maybe...

523
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:09,420
... maybe he could grab her and lift her up.

524
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,254
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs around his waist.

525
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,620
Then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and stomach.

526
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:22,027
Then he could use his teeth to undo her dress and...

527
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,132
...and bite her!

528
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,527
Then right when the scene ends, he could take her...

529
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,571
...with this raw, animal....

530
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,210
Something like that?

531
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,041
That's pretty much what I had in mind.

532
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,309
It's a little early to be drinking.

533
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,407
Things finally happened with Kate.

534
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,514
You're kidding? That's great.

535
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,048
It was so amazing.

536
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,615
After the lovemaking...

537
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,754
Oh, my.

538
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,821
... I just watched her sleep for hours.

539
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,495
Just breathing in...

540
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,561
...and breathing out.

541
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,858
I knew she was dreaming because...

542
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,399
... her eyes kept going like this.

543
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,837
I'm telling you, she's got it all wrong.

544
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,537
All I said was, "This was fun. Let's do it again sometime.

545
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,009
I'll give you a call."

546
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,753
I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?

547
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,421
It's what you say at the end of a date.

548
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,456
You can't just say, "Nice to meet you. Good night?"

549
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,292
To her face?

550
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,992
I'm standing there...

551
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,565
...she's waiting for me to say I'll call her...

552
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,100
...and it comes out. I can't help it.

553
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,329
It's a compulsion.

554
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:13,807
When a guy says he'll call, it doesn't mean he's going to call.

555
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,147
This never happened to you?

556
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,315
Well, they always called.

557
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,813
Bite me.

558
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,488
-Did he call? -No, sorry.

559
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,959
Why? He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?

560
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,294
Maybe he's intimidated by smart, strong, successful women.

561
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,433
Sophie, will you please climb out of my butt.

562
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,673
Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?

563
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,206
Maybe he feels awkward because you're my boss.

564
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,441
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?

565
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,211
You didn't tell him not to call me, did you?

566
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,449
If you're uncomfortable with your friend dating me...

567
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,183
...there are always ways to fix that.

568
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,656
Call her. Call her now!

569
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,696
Multiple so many paper cuts.

570
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,932
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why, why? I don't understand!"

571
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,509
I'm telling you, she's flipped out! She's gone crazy!

572
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,572
Well, give me the phone then.

573
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,845
She thinks it's my fault you haven't called her.

574
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,383
You have to call her.

575
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,713
You can't call somebody after this long to say:

576
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,221
"In case you didn't notice, I don't like you."

577
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,425
Then you'll have to take her out again.

578
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,421
She's really dull, and she gets this...

579
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,828
...gross mascara-goop thing in the corner of her eye!

580
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,329
I don't care!

581
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,506
You'll take her out again and end it...

582
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,107
...in a way she knows it's ended.

583
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,176
I don't care how hard it is. Don't tell her you'll call her again!

584
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,411
All right, fine!

585
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,879
But just lunch. From now on, I get my own dates.

586
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,246
I don't want you setting me up again!

587
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,453
That's fine!

588
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,585
-That's just a lot of big talk. -I know.

589
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,422
I'm in the shower!

590
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,936
Fire! There's a fire! Fire!

591
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:07,250
I talked to Lauren. I told her how things were with us.

592
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,146
Did you talk to Marshall?

593
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,414
About what?

594
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,022
About what happened with us.

595
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:21,193
No, there's really no reason why he should find out.

596
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,163
So let's not make a big deal out of it, okay?

597
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,867
What are you talking about?

598
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,301
It was a big deal.

599
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,646
You can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you.

600
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,180
I was there. You're not that good an actress.

601
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,517
I was just caught up in the moment.

602
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,484
That's all it was.

603
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,425
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but...

604
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,597
... haven't you slept with a woman and it meant more to her than to you?

605
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,067
Hi, pig!

606
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,943
Sorry I scared you in there.

607
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,840
It's okay.

608
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,807
By the way...

609
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,179
... I was just checking the shower massager.

610
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,560
I tried to reach you at work.

611
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,161
There's been a fire.

612
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,958
What? Oh, my God!

613
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,393
What happened?

614
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,400
We believe it originated here...

615
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,566
...in the Aroma Room.

616
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,678
Did everyone get out okay?

617
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,145
The giraffe's okay, and so is the pirate.

618
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,884
-What's this? -No, don't look!

619
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,178
You don't want to see what's under there!

620
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,159
The foster puppets!

621
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:03,228
It's not a big deal. It's right here, and it's all the time.

622
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,430
Thanks again for lunch.

623
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,871
-This was pleasant. -lt was, wasn't it?

624
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,111
-The food there was great. -Wasn't it?

625
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,583
So take care.

626
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,279
You too.

627
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,256
I'll give you a call. We should do it again!

628
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,928
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

629
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,756
-Any messages? -Sophie's desk.

630
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,698
Are you gonna call her?

631
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,372
I'm sorry, okay? I'm weak and pathetic and sorry.

632
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,103
You are gonna tell her. You'll tell her now.

633
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,111
I'm not gonna call you.

634
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,549
What?

635
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,888
I'm sorry.

636
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:01,819
I'm sorry I said I was going to when I'm not.

637
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,894
This has nothing to do with you.

638
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,497
And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me.

639
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,792
I have serious problems when it comes to women.

640
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:15,167
I have issues with commitment, intimacy...

641
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,298
... mascara goop.

642
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,906
I'm really sorry. It's just that...

643
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,809
...this isn't going to work out.

644
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,248
This isn't how I was hoping this would end...

645
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,790
... but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.

646
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,869
I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime!

647
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,375
Anyway, Beth, what I'm saying is...

648
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:01,551
... I should have considered your feelings before I went home with you.

649
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,381
I've recently learned what it's like to be on your side...

650
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,353
...and I'm sorry.

651
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,156
Do you think you can forgive me?

652
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,165
Great. Thanks.

653
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,138
Hello, Jennifer?

654
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,040
Hi, Mrs. Laurio. Is Jennifer there?

655
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,647
She's not home, huh?

656
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,052
Actually I kind of need to talk to you too.
