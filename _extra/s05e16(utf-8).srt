1
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
- What are you guys doing up?- Finishing the crossword.

2
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
Do you know a six-letterword for "red"?

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
Dark-red.

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dotsin here for you later.

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
Hey, how about maroon?

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
Yes! You are so smart!

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
You guys are so cute.

8
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
I know.

9
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
See you in the morning.

10
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
I love doing crosswordpuzzles with you.

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:46
Me too.

12
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
Now let's finish thisand go to bed.

13
00:00:49 --> 00:00:50
Only one left.

14
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Three-letter word.Not dog, but...

15
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
Cat.

16
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
You are so smart!

17
00:01:01 --> 00:01:01
I love you.

18
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
I love you too.

19
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
The One with a Cop

20
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
We still need a tip.

21
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
All right. Hold on.

22
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
I got it.

23
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
Nickel.

24
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
- How much do we need?- Couple of bucks.

25
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
Okay, dime.

26
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
You guys keep talking.This could take a while.

27
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
Wait, look it!

28
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
This is a police badge!

29
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
Cool. But why would a cop comein here? They don't serve doughnuts.

30
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
Can you discover the badge again?I can do better than that.

31
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
I bet somebody'smissing that badge.

32
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
I should take it back.But at the police station...

33
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
...I'll check theirTen Most Wanted.

34
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
My friend's been Number 11 forever.This could be her year!

35
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
- Hey, you guys.- Hey, Joey.

36
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
Is that my sweatshirt?

37
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
Yes, it is. I'm sorry.I was cold. I hope it's okay.

38
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
It's just that if you wearsomeone's sweatshirt...

39
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

40
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
And I'm not him.

41
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
I'm sorry.I'll give it back.

42
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
It's going to be allsmelling like Monica.

43
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
Do I smell bad?

44
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
You smell like a meadow.

45
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
What's with him?

47
00:03:05 --> 00:03:10
The last time Joey went to a meadow,his mother was shot by a hunter.

48
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
I still don't know.

49
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
I want to make sure I boughtthe right couch, one that says...

50
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
..."Kids welcome here",but that also says...

51
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
..."Come here to me."

52
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
What? You say that to kids?

53
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
The "Come here to me" is,you know, for the ladies.

54
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
Honey, it's a nice couch,not a magic couch.

55
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
Well, you picked a great couch.

56
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
- Sign here please.- Sure.

57
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
The delivery chargeis almost as much as the couch!

58
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
That's ridiculous.He lives three blocks away.

59
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
I'll take it myself.Thank you.

60
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
All right, Rach, come on.Let's go.

61
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
Are you kidding?

62
00:04:09 --> 00:04:14
Come on. It's only three blocks.It's not very heavy. Try it.

63
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Oh, I can do it.

64
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
You two will reallyenjoy that couch.

65
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
We're not together.

66
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
Something didn't quite add up there.

67
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
What's that supposed to mean?

68
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
Well, you. Her.

69
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
I mean, she's very...

70
00:04:38 --> 00:04:39
...you know.

71
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
And you're, like...

72
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
...you know?

73
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
Not that it's any of your business,but we did go out.

74
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
Really? You two?

75
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
I don't want to do this now.I'm carrying a heavy couch.

76
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
Then tell him quickly.

77
00:04:55 --> 00:04:56
Fine. We went out.

78
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
Not only did we go out...

79
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
...we did it 298 times!

80
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
You kept count?You are such a loser!

81
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
A loser you did it with 298 times!

82
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't putyour cigarette out on a tree.

83
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
Yeah, I can.It worked well.

84
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
But you shouldn't.So don't ever do that again.

85
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
I won't till I havemy next cigarette.

86
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
Hold it!

87
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
NYPD. Freeze, punk!

88
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
That's right. You are so busted.

89
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Book them.

90
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
- Who are you talking to?- Save it, red!

91
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
Apologize to the tree orspend the night in the slammer.

92
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
I am not apologizing to a tree.

93
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
Apologize to the tree now,or I am calling for backup.

94
00:05:50 --> 00:05:51
Backup! Backup!

95
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
I'm sorry! Sorry!

96
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
Okay, cancel backup!Cancel backup!

97
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
Didn't you say there wasan elevator in here?

98
00:06:00 --> 00:06:04
Yes, I did, but there isn't.Here we go!

99
00:06:04 --> 00:06:05
Okay, go left.

100
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
Left. Left.

101
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Okay, you know what?There's no more left left.

102
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
Lift it straight up over your head.

103
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Straight up. You can do it!

104
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
You can do it!

105
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
Okay. You got it?

106
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
- Go, go.- Good, good.

107
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
You got it, right?You got it, right? You got...

108
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
Any chance you thinkit looks good there?

109
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
This guy was all...

110
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
And I'm all,"Buffay! Homicide!"

111
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
It was just so cool!

112
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
- You were supposed to take it back.- I'm having fun doing good deeds.

113
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
You can get arrestedfor impersonating a police officer.

114
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
You could get arrestedright now!

115
00:06:47 --> 00:06:51
I'd better take it back.I'm totally drunk with power.

116
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
Yeah. I didn't knowyou guys would be here.

117
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
- Do me a favor. Taste this.- What? Why?

118
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
- What is with you?- Nothing.

119
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
You're acting strange.

120
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
All right. There is something.

121
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
I kind of had a dream.

122
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
But I don't want to talk about it.

123
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
What if Martin Luther Kinghad said that?

124
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
I kind of have a dream.

125
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
I don't want to talk about it.

126
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
Look, it involved Monica.

127
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
You dreamt about the girl I'm seeing?Cool.

128
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.

129
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
Let's talk about your dream.I love you. Your dream?

130
00:07:34 --> 00:07:37
There was no sex.I haven't dreamt of her like that...

131
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
...since I found outabout you two-ish.

132
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
What was the dream about?

133
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
You were my girlfriend.We were doing the crossword puzzle.

134
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
Like you did last night.

135
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
That's it. I'm in lovewith Monica. I'll move out.

136
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
Joey, come on. That doesn't meanyou're in love with me.

137
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
It doesn't?

138
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
It could mean anything.Like...

139
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
...you're jealous that I've becomethe apartment stud.

140
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
Sounds like your dream.

141
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
Or it could mean you saw Chandlerand me being close and stuff...

142
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
...and you want that too.

143
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
In the dreamI did enjoy the closeness.

144
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
Are you attracted to Monica?

145
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
Right here, right now,are you attracted to her?

146
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
- Not really.- There you have it!

147
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
Well, sure!I'm just wearing sweats!

148
00:08:28 --> 00:08:28
But that's good!

149
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
You're not in love with me.You just want a girlfriend.

150
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
It's not just aboutgetting a girlfriend.

151
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
I could get a girlfriend.We could sit and do crossword puzzles.

152
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
But could we havethe closeness like you have?

153
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
Monica and I were friendsbefore we dated. Maybe that's it.

154
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
Friends first?

155
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
That's interesting.

156
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
- You become friends after?- No, never done that either.

157
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
Do you guys have the tape measure?

158
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
Yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.

159
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
That's right.

160
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
What's up, Joey?

161
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
How you doing?

162
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
Excuse me. Is this your car?

163
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
Don't park here.You're blocking the entrance.

164
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Don't worry.It's not a problem.

165
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
It's a problem for me, so it's aproblem for you because I'm a cop.

166
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
So am I.

167
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
Okay. So you're a cop.You can park anywhere.

168
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
I know because I'm a cop too.

169
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
Keep up the good work.Ten four.

170
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
Wait. So what precinctare you with?

171
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
I'm with the 57th.

172
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
- I know a guy in Homicide up there.- I'm in Vice.

173
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
In fact, I'm undercoverright now. I'm a whore.

174
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
Who else is in Vice there?

175
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
Do you know...

176
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
...Sipowitz?

177
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
Sipowitz? I don't think so.

178
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah.Big guy, kind of bald.

179
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
I don't know him.

180
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
Don't try to call him.He's not there. He's out.

181
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
His partner just died.

182
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorryfor his loss.

183
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
I sure will. Take care.

184
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
By the way, Sipowitzwill be all right.

185
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
That kid from "Silver Spoons"is really good.

186
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
Where'd you find my badge?

187
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
Could you give me and Rossa hand moving his couch?

188
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
I'd love to but I got acting class.But you know what?

189
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
I guess I could blow that off......or you.

190
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
Let me ask you something.I was talking with Monica and Chandler.

191
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
Boy, they are really tight.

192
00:10:55 --> 00:10:55
I know.

193
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
That's not a bad situationthey got there.

194
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
Think I'll get me one of those.

195
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
What's up, Joe?

196
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
I think Monica and Chandlerare so great...

197
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
...because they were friends first.

198
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
So I asked myself, who are my friends?You and Phoebe.

199
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
I saw you first, so...

200
00:11:18 --> 00:11:23
- What are you saying?- Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

201
00:11:25 --> 00:11:26
You know, honey...

202
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
...as flattered as I am...

203
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
...that you saw me first...

204
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
...I just don't think we should becranking anything up.

205
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
I'll treat you real nice.

206
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
Yeah. Well, you know...

207
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
I think it's a great idea to becomefriends with someone before you date.

208
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
But the way you do it is youmeet someone, become their friend...

209
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
...build a foundation,then ask them out on a date.

210
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
Don't hit on your existing friends.

211
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
Won't that take longer?

212
00:12:03 --> 00:12:04
Oh, but once you find it...

213
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
...it's so worth the wait.

214
00:12:08 --> 00:12:09
I understand.

215
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
Good.

216
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.

217
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
Come here to me.

218
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
No, no. You come here to me.

219
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
- I brought reinforcements.- Great! You brought Joey?

220
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
The next best thing.

221
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
You brought Chandler?The next best thing would be Monica!

222
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
I would be offended, but Monicais freakishly strong, so...

223
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
I drew a sketchof how we'll do it.

224
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
Rach, that's you.

225
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
That's the couch.

226
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
What's that?

227
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
That's me.

228
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

229
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
No. That's my arm.

230
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
I see. I thought you just really,really liked your new couch.

231
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
Just follow my lead.

232
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
Come on, Chandler.

233
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
- All right.- Okay.

234
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
Here we go.

235
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
All right. Ready?

236
00:13:14 --> 00:13:15
Turn!

237
00:13:15 --> 00:13:16
Turn!

238
00:13:16 --> 00:13:17
Turn!

239
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
- I don't think we can turn anymore!- I don't think it'll fit!

240
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Yeah, it will.Come on! Up, up, up!

241
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
Up! Yes!

242
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
Here we go! Pivot!

243
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
Pivot!

244
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
Pivot!

245
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
Pivot!

246
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
Pivot!

247
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
Pivot!

248
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

249
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
I don't think it'll pivot anymore.

250
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
You think?

251
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
All right, let's bring itback down and try again.

252
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
I think it's really stuck now.

253
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
- I can't believe that didn't work.- I know. Me neither.

254
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
I mean, you had a sketch.

255
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
What did you mean whenyou said "pivot"?

256
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
How's it going?Make any new friends?

257
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
Yeah.I met this woman.

258
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
What's she like?

259
00:14:21 --> 00:14:22
Well, she's...

260
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
...really good in bed.

261
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
- You were going to be friends first.- Hey, it's all your fault.

262
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
Why?

263
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
You didn't give me advice.You gave me a pickup line.

264
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
I told her I wanted to"build a foundation and be friends".

265
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,I became irresistible to her!

266
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
And her roommate!

267
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
What about the "closeness"?

268
00:14:44 --> 00:14:49
Closeness, schmosness! There wasthree of us, for crying out loud!

269
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
Who wants pizza?

270
00:14:53 --> 00:14:54
I do! I do! I do!

271
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
This is great! Can you believeI found it on the second floor?

272
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
- Who is it?- NYPD.

273
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
Oh, my God!

274
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
Just a minute, officer!

275
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
- I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.- My God, it's him! It's that cop!

276
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
- I can't believe he found me!- Are you going to go to jail?

277
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
If I go down,you guys go down with me.

278
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
Harboring a fugitive?That's one-to-three years minimum.

279
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
Good luck, Chandler.

280
00:15:31 --> 00:15:35
Arrest me, but you'll nevermake it stick and you know it.

281
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
I have no choice, it's my job.You understand, right?

282
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
And you understand thatI'm calling my lawyer.

283
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
And once he puts you on the standhe'll make you look like a fool!

284
00:15:45 --> 00:15:46
I don't like looking foolish.

285
00:15:46 --> 00:15:50
Maybe I don't arrest you today.Maybe I came by and you weren't here.

286
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
I'd love it if I weren't here!

287
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
Since you're not going to jail tonight,I was wondering if you'd...

288
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
...like to go to dinner with me?

289
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
Me?

290
00:15:59 --> 00:16:02
Ever since you flashed my badge,I can't stop thinking about you.

291
00:16:02 --> 00:16:07
You're the prettiest fakeundercover whore I've ever seen.

292
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
Nice.

293
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
Wow, I didn't see that coming.You're asking me out.

294
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
I could've done it better,but they're staring at me.

295
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
I'd like to go outwith you, officer.

296
00:16:20 --> 00:16:21
- Gary.- Gary.

297
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
Okay, so it's a date.

298
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
I got to ask you, though.How'd you find me?

299
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
I ran your fingerprintsthrough the computer.

300
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
This was listedas your last known address.

301
00:16:30 --> 00:16:31
Impressive.

302
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
Not as impressive as you. Your recordshows you've done some weird stuff.

303
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
We'll talk at dinner.

304
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
- So I'll come by and pick you up?- I can't wait.

305
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
Don't worry, I won't justtake you out for doughnuts.

306
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
He has a gun!

307
00:16:52 --> 00:16:56
I'd like to return this couch.I'm not satisfied with it.

308
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
You want to return this couch?

309
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
It's cut in half.

310
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
- That's what I'm telling you.- Did you cut this couch in half?

311
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
This couch is cut in half!

312
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
I would like to exchange it for onethat is not cut in half.

313
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
You're saying this couch wasdelivered to you like this?

314
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

315
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
I will accept store credit.

316
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
I'll give you store creditin the amount of four dollars.

317
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
I will take it.
