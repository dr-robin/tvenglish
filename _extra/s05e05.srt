1
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
What time is it?

2
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
Nine.

3
00:00:24 --> 00:00:25
But it's dark out.

4
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
That's because you alwayssleep till noon, silly.

5
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
This is what nine looks like.

6
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
I guess I'll get washed up then.

7
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
Watch that sunrise.

8
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
I'm getting tired of alwayssneaking around.

9
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
Me too. What if we went awayfor the weekend? No interruptions.

10
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
We could be nakedthe entire time.

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
All weekend?That's a whole lot of naked.

12
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
I'll say I have a conferenceand you can have a chef thing.

13
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
I wanted to go to thisculinary fair in Jersey!

14
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
Okay.You know you're not, though.

15
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
- Let's go.- Okay. Wait.

16
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
What about Joey?

17
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
The One with the Kips

18
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
I'm going to a culinary fairin Jersey this weekend.

19
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
How weird! Chandler just saidhe's got a conference there.

20
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
That's funny. Seems likeChandler's conference could've been...

21
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
...in Connecticut or Vermont.

22
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
I'm not in charge of wherethe conference is held.

23
00:02:01 --> 00:02:06
Do you want people to think it's fake?It's a real conference.

24
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
- Is Rachel here?- No, she's out shopping.

25
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
- Damn!- What's going on?

26
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
I told Emily to come.

27
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
And I just need to, you know,talk to Rachel about it.

28
00:02:17 --> 00:02:18
Wait a minute.

29
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
When Emily comes,you won't see Rachel anymore?

30
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
I'm focusing on the"I get to see my wife" part...

31
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
...and not on the partthat makes me do this.

32
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
So you'll never bein a room together?

33
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
How will that even work?

34
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
I have no idea.I mean...

35
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
But I assure you,I will figure it out.

36
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
It doesn't seem like it'll work.

37
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
Hi, guys.

38
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
What's going on?

39
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
We're flipping Monica's mattress.

40
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
So I'm thinking, basically,we pick it up, and then we flip it.

41
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
That's better than my way.

42
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
Hey guys, would you flip mine too?

43
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
Oh, man.

44
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.

45
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
So, Rach?

46
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
You know how Emily's coming?

47
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
Oh, yeah. I know.

48
00:03:13 --> 00:03:14
Can you hear anything?

49
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
Yeah, somebody just said,"Can you hear anything?"

50
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
Hey, Joey's ass.

51
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
What are you doing?

52
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Remember when they foughtand broke up...

53
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
...and we were stuck hereall night with no food?

54
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,I figured it'd happen again.

55
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
So I hid this in here.

56
00:03:36 --> 00:03:37
Candy bars, crossword puzzles...

57
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
"Mad Libs"! Mine!

58
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
Condoms?

59
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
You don't know how longwe'll be in here.

60
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
We may have tore-populate the Earth.

61
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
And condoms are the way to do that?

62
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
Anyway, it all boils down to this.

63
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
- The last time I talked to Emily...- Oh, my God! Our dog died!

64
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
- What?- Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog!

65
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
LaPooh's still alive?

66
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
It says he was hit byan ice-cream truck and dragged for...

67
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
...nineteen blocks!

68
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
- Oh, my God.- Sweetie, we heard you crying.

69
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
- Please don't cry.- It's LaPooh!

70
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
I know, it's LaPooh right nowbut it'll get better.

71
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
I can't believe it! We're here!

72
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Chocolates on the pillows!I love that!

73
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
You should live with Joey.Rolos everywhere.

74
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
I'll be right back.

75
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
Oh, yes!

76
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
Get in here.It's a high-speed car chase on!

77
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
We're switching rooms.

78
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
Oh, dear God!They gave us glasses!

79
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
The glasses have lipstick on them.

80
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Who knows what elsethey didn't change?

81
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
Sweetie...

82
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
...I just want this weekendto be perfect.

83
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
We can change rooms, can't we?

84
00:05:03 --> 00:05:08
Okay, but let's do it now.Chopper Five just lost its feed!

85
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
You know how there was somethingI wanted to talk to you about?

86
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
Oh, yeah.

87
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
I'm trying to workthings out with Emily.

88
00:05:22 --> 00:05:23
Well, there's this...

89
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
...one thing.

90
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
Here goes.

91
00:05:31 --> 00:05:32
I made a promise that...

92
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
- What?- Your nose is bleeding.

93
00:05:34 --> 00:05:35
Oh, God!

94
00:05:35 --> 00:05:36
You're bleeding.

95
00:05:36 --> 00:05:37
Not again.

96
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
This happened whenmy grandfather died.

97
00:05:40 --> 00:05:41
Sorry.

98
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
Gross.

99
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
Okay. So I'm sorry.What did you want to tell me?

100
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
Sorry. Sorry.

101
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
I can't see you anymore.

102
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
I know, it's ridiculous.I can't see you, either.

103
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
- I think you'll like this room more.- Okay, great.

104
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
They say he's only gothalf a tank left.

105
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
Half a tank? Still lotsof high-speed chasing to do!

106
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
- We're switching rooms again.- What? Why?

107
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
This has a garden view.We paid for an ocean view.

108
00:06:20 --> 00:06:25
Our last ocean-view roomwas unacceptable to you.

109
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
Excuse me. Can I talk to youover here for just a second?

110
00:06:33 --> 00:06:36
These clowns want to take usfor a ride. I won't let them.

111
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
We're not a couple of suckers.

112
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
I hear you, Mugsy.

113
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
All these rooms are fine.

114
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
Just pick one so I can watch the...

115
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
Have a perfect, magicalweekend together with you?

116
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
- This one I like.- Nothing.

117
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Nothing. It's over. Damn it!

118
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
This is regularly scheduledprogramming!

119
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
Can we turn the TV off?

120
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
Do we really want to spendthe weekend like this?

121
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
Am I getting in the wayof the room-switching fun?

122
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
Don't blame me for tonight.

123
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
Who should I blame?The nice bellman?

124
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
Or the idiot who thoughthe could drive...

125
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
...from Albany to Canadaon half a tank of gas?

126
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
Do not speak ill of the dead.

127
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
We're supposed to be spendinga romantic weekend together.

128
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
What's the matter?

129
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
I just want to watcha little television.

130
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
Jeez, relax, Mom.

131
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
What did you say?

132
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."

133
00:07:43 --> 00:07:47
I've been wanting to tell you somethingand I just have to get it out.

134
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
Okay. What's up?

135
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
You know how you said to dowhatever it takes to fix my marriage?

136
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
Yeah, I told you to give Emilywhatever she wants.

137
00:07:59 --> 00:08:04
And while that was good advice,you should know that what she wants...

138
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
...is for me not to see you anymore.

139
00:08:11 --> 00:08:16
That's crazy! You can't do that.What are you going to tell her?

140
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
Oh, my God!

141
00:08:21 --> 00:08:24
You've already agreed to this.

142
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
It's awful, I know.

143
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
But I have to do thisif I want my marriage to work.

144
00:08:29 --> 00:08:34
And I do. I have to makethis marriage work. I have to.

145
00:08:36 --> 00:08:41
But the good thing is, we can stillsee each other until she gets here.

146
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
Lucky me! Oh, my God!That is good news, Ross!

147
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
That's the best news I've heardsince LaPooh died!

148
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
You have no idea what a nightmarethis has been. This is so hard.

149
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?

150
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
- Let me make this easier for you.- What are you doing?

151
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
- Storming out.- It's your apartment.

152
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!

153
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
Damn Rolos!

154
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
You're back!How was your conference?

155
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
It was terrible. I fought withmy colleagues for the entire time.

156
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Are you kidding with this?

157
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
So your weekend was a bust?

158
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
No, I got to see Donald Trumpwaiting for an elevator.

159
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
You're back too.

160
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
Could I talk to you for a second?

161
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
- How was your chef thing?- It was awful.

162
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
Some people don'tappreciate good food.

163
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
Maybe the food tasted good at first...

164
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
...but then made everybody vomitand have diarrhea.

165
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
How much was the room?I'll pay my half.

166
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
Fine. $300.

167
00:09:56 --> 00:09:57
$300?

168
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
Just think of it as $25 per room.

169
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
What are you guys woofing about?

170
00:10:04 --> 00:10:08
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!

171
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
You know what?Now that I think about it...

172
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
...I constantly find myselfwithout 20s, and you...

173
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
...always have lots.

174
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
You should've seenthe look on her face.

175
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
I don't want Rachel to hate me.I don't know what to do.

176
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
- You want my advice?- Yes. Please.

177
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
- You won't like it.- That's okay.

178
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
You got married too fast.

179
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
- That's not advice.- I told you.

180
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
I'm going to the bathroom.

181
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44
If anyone asked me to give upany of you, I couldn't do it.

182
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
Me neither.

183
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
Maybe I could do it.

184
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
I know you guys heard aboutme and Ross.

185
00:10:53 --> 00:10:57
But I've been obsessing about itand would love not to talk about it.

186
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
I don't know if this fallsunder that category...

187
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
...but Ross is right back there.

188
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
- That's not Ross.- Not that guy.

189
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
He does look like him, though.

190
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
Ross is in the bathroom.

191
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
Oh, my God! It's happening.It's already started. I'm Kip.

192
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
Yeah, you're not Kip.

193
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
Do you even know who Kip is?

194
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
Who cares? You're Rachel.

195
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
Who's Kip?

196
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
My old roommate.We all hung out together.

197
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
Oh, that poor bastard.

198
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
You told me the story.He and Monica dated.

199
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
When they broke up, you allpromised you'd stay his friend.

200
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
And what happened?He got phased out.

201
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
- You won't be phased out.- Of course, I am.

202
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
It won't happen to Ross. He's yourbrother, your college roommate.

203
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
It was just a matter of time.

204
00:11:42 --> 00:11:46
I just assumed Phoebewould be the one to go.

205
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
You live far away,you're not related.

206
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
You lift right out.

207
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
Hey, Mr. Bing.

208
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
That hotel you stayed at called.

209
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
Someone left an eyelash curlerin your room.

210
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
Yes, that was mine.

211
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
I figured you meta girl and she left it.

212
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
That would have made more sense.

213
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
I don't even feel likeI know you anymore.

214
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
All right, I'm just goingto ask you this one time.

215
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
Whatever you say,I'll believe you.

216
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
Were you or were you not...

217
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
...on a gay cruise?

218
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
I'm sorry about the whole"lifting out" thing.

219
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
You got to come with me.

220
00:12:47 --> 00:12:48
- Where?- Wherever I go.

221
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
You and me, we'll start a new group.We're the best ones.

222
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Okay, but try to get Joey too.

223
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
Pheebs, do you mind if Ispeak to Rachel alone?

224
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
Sure.

225
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
Bye, Ross.

226
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
Forever.

227
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
Why are you here?Isn't this against the rules?

228
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
I talked to Monica.

229
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
Look, I'm the onewho made the choice.

230
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
I'm the one who's makingthings change.

231
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
So I should be the one to,you know, step back.

232
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
No, no, it's okay. Really.

233
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
Plenty of people just see theirsisters at Thanksgiving...

234
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
...their college roommatesat reunions...

235
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
...and Joey at Burger King.

236
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
Is that better?

237
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
No, it's not better.

238
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
I still don't get to see you.

239
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
What would you do?If you were me, what would you do?

240
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
First, I'd have saidthe right name at my wedding.

241
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
I can't believe this.

242
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
I know.

243
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
I am so sorry.

244
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
I know that too.

245
00:14:29 --> 00:14:30
Hey, Rach?

246
00:14:30 --> 00:14:35
Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe saidyou want to talk to me about a trip?

247
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
I just came over to drop off...

248
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
...nothing.

249
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
So that weekend kind of sucked.

250
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
Yeah, it did.

251
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
So I guess this is over?

252
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
You know, you and me.I mean, it had to end sometime.

253
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
Why exactly?

254
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
Because of the weekend.We had a fight.

255
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
Chandler, that's crazy.

256
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
If you always gave upafter a fight...

257
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
...you'd never be with anyonelonger than...

258
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
This isn't over?

259
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
You are so cute!

260
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
No, no. It was a fight.

261
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27
You deal with it and you move on.It's nothing to freak out about.

262
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
Really? Okay, great!

263
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
Welcome to an adult relationship.

264
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
We're in a relationship?

265
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
I'm afraid so.

266
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
I heard you saw Donald Trumpat your convention.

267
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Saw him waiting for an elevator.

268
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
Can I use your eyelash curler?I lost mine.

269
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
It's in the bathroom.

270
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
Can I talk to you for a second?

271
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
Yes.

272
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
Yes.

273
00:16:19 --> 00:16:20
You?

274
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
And you?

275
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
But you cannot tell anyone.No one knows.

276
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
But how? When?

277
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
- It happened in London.- In London!

278
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
We didn't want to makea big deal out of it.

279
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
But it is a big deal!I have to tell someone!

280
00:16:38 --> 00:16:38
You can't.

281
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
We just don't want to deal withtelling everyone.

282
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
Please just promise you won't tell.

283
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
All right.

284
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
Man, this is unbelievable!

285
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
I mean, it's great!

286
00:16:52 --> 00:16:53
But...

287
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
I know. It's great!

288
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
I don't want to see that!

289
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
We're so stupid.

290
00:17:02 --> 00:17:07
Do you know what's going on in there?They're trying to take Joey!

291
00:17:10 --> 00:17:14
"The most popular Phoebe in tennisis called the overhand Phoebe."

292
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18
"If you win, slap your opponenton the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe'!"

293
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
That's cute.We really all enjoyed it.

294
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
- But it doesn't count.- For what?

295
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
Just count in our headsas good Mad Libs.

296
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
- I got to go.- Fun's over.

297
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
Wait, if we follow the rules...

298
00:17:31 --> 00:17:32
...it's still funand it means something.

299
00:17:33 --> 00:17:34
I'm going to take off.

300
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
Guys, rules are good!

301
00:17:36 --> 00:17:39
Rules help control the fun.
