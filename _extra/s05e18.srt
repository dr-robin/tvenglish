1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
Pick a card.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
All right. Now, memorize it.

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
- You got it?- Oh, yes.

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
Is that your card?

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
- Hey, guys.- Hi there!

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:22
Guess what?Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
It's not for sure.

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
We met this guy in the parkwho thought Ben was cute.

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
You know, which he is.He gave us his card...

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
...and told us to bring himfor this commercial he's auditioning.

12
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
The biggest commercialcasting director in town!

13
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
Ben takes one lousy walkin the park and gets an audition?

14
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
I mean, way to go, Ben!

15
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
I've been there a million timesand no one's offered me an audition.

16
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
It's crazy. We were pushingBen on the swings...

17
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
I'm always on the swings!

18
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
What am I doing wrong?

19
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
That.

20
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
The One Where Rachel Smokes

21
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
- Gotta go. Wish me luck.- Good luck.

22
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
Since you work at Ralph Lauren,can you get me some shirts?

23
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
I don't know if I'd feel comfortablestealing on my very first day.

24
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
Unwilling to steal from work.

25
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
Interesting.

26
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
If anybody gets free stuff,it's me.

27
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.

28
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
Go get 'em!

29
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
Let's discuss Rachel's birthday.

30
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
I say we throwa surprise party this weekend.

31
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
But her birthday'snot for another month.

32
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
If we throw a party on her birthday,it's not a surprise.

33
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
Great! We can have a dinner partyand invite her close friends.

34
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
Ross! We're havinga surprise party for Rachel.

35
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Done.

36
00:02:17 --> 00:02:18
Great. Wanna do it together?

37
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
I'd love to do it together!

38
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
They're gonna do it together.

39
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
That's my girlfriend.

40
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
So I gotta shut it down now?

41
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
I gotta go.I'm picking up Ben...

42
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
...and then we're offto the big audition.

43
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
It'll be weird seeing some actorpretending to be Ben's dad.

44
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
Weirder than his two moms making out?

45
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
Dad? There's a dadin the commercial?

46
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soupand pretend to enjoy it.

47
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
Maybe I'll go with youand audition as the dad.

48
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
Who better to play Ben's dadthan his godfather?

49
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
- You're not his godfather.- What?

50
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
Are you kidding?

51
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
Of course I am.

52
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
- Okay, let's go, godfather.- All right!

53
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
They'll let me audition!

54
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
Really? That's great!

55
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
One of the casting ladieshas actually seen me in a play.

56
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
So I steered clear of her.

57
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
- That kid looks familiar.- Oh, yeah.

58
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
He's done tons of commercials:Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...

59
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
...and for the phone company.

60
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
He was so good, he convinced meto switch phone companies.

61
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Chandler was mad.

62
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
He's not gonna get this one.Ben is way cuter than that kid.

63
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
I mean, look at him.

64
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
That's great.

65
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
Wouldn't it be greatif I got to play Ben's dad?

66
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
You look nothing like Ben.

67
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
I look more like him than you do.

68
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
I really don't know youwell enough for you to do that.

69
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
So it's down to these two.Nancy, I know you like this one.

70
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
I think I agree.Rachel, what do you think?

71
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
Well, that one is pretty...

72
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
...but I just love this fabric.

73
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
Sorry.

74
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
Don't be. Part of your jobis to give your opinions.

75
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
Then I take credit for them.I'm kidding!

76
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
She is kidding. But don't everdisagree with her again.

77
00:04:12 --> 00:04:13
Okay, now I'm kidding!

78
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
What a fun office.

79
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
I don't know which one.But I do know I need a cigarette.

80
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
Let's take a break, go outsideand sort this out when we return.

81
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
- You smoke?- No.

82
00:04:27 --> 00:04:31
My dad's a doctor. And he wouldalways tell me horror stories...

83
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
About ghosts and goblins...

84
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
...who totally supportedthe princess's right to smoke.

85
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
Then they came back from smokingand they'd made all of the decisions.

86
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
- That's not fair.- I know.

87
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
It's like I'm being punishedfor not having this disgusting habit.

88
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
Yeah, it is the best.

89
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
What if this keeps happening?

90
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
They'll be smoking,making the decisions...

91
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
...and I'll be up in my officebreathing in my stupid clean air.

92
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
And when Kim wantsto promote one of us...

93
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
...who do you think she'll pick?Me or Smokey Smokerson?

94
00:05:07 --> 00:05:12
You can go down there and not smoke.Say you want some fresh air.

95
00:05:12 --> 00:05:13
I could do that.

96
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
Or you could dothe easy thing and smoke.

97
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
Do you wanna go get coffee?

98
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
- I would love to.- Oh, good.

99
00:05:20 --> 00:05:21
I'm gonna go too.

100
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
Oh, good.

101
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
Oh, I changed my mind.

102
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
Let's talk about the party.I have so many ideas.

103
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
Me too!

104
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Oh, look at that.

105
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
This is a little sketchof the cake. See?

106
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Some sample menus.

107
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
I thought we'd start witha Tuscan-style finger food.

108
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
And for music, here's analphabetized list of all of my CDs.

109
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
I've highlighted the onesthat'll go with the food.

110
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
- What about the dinner party?- We're not doing that.

111
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
Looks like you took care ofeverything. Thanks a lot, cohost.

112
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
Wait a minute. There's plentyof things for you to do.

113
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
Like what?

114
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
Cups.

115
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
You're giving me cups?

116
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
And ice.

117
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
Cups and ice? I get to bein charge of cups and ice?

118
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
All right.

119
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
Fine. I will bein charge of cups and ice.

120
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
- I can get ice at the restaurant...- I got it!

121
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
- How did the audition go?- Not so good.

122
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
Wait a minute.Are you doing Joey's...

123
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
..."The audition didn't go so well.Yeah, it did!"

124
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
Yeah, I am!

125
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
- Yeah, Ben got a second audition.- Oh, great!

126
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
I had to teach Ross my bit becauseI actually didn't get a callback.

127
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
You got a callback too, didn't you?

128
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
Yeah, I did!

129
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
What are you doing out here?

130
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
It got kind of lonely up there,so I thought I would come out here...

131
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
...and get some fresh air.

132
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
We're discussing the fall collection.

133
00:06:59 --> 00:06:59
Oh, great.

134
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
Anyway, we really...

135
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
- Sorry. We're smoking all over you.- That's okay.

136
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
We'll move. You stay there.

137
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
I sent the designs to Ralph.He was excited about it.

138
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
That's great!You are the best!

139
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
Excuse me.Can I bum one of those?

140
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
Actually, this one's...

141
00:07:17 --> 00:07:18
What's so funny over here?

142
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
I thought you didn't smoke.

143
00:07:20 --> 00:07:25
You know, I thought you guysmeant marijuana cigarettes.

144
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
You know what I mean?Doobies?

145
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
Actually, I thought to myself,"Those guys are crazy!"

146
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
But no, I smoke theregular ones all the time.

147
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
We get high.

148
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Me too.

149
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
I'm kidding.

150
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
Me too.

151
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
Oh, God! This is so nerve-racking.How do you do this?

152
00:07:47 --> 00:07:50
Fortunately, I don't getmany callbacks so...

153
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
Is it a good sign thatthey asked us to wait?

154
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
Who knows?

155
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
We have narrowed it downto Raymond, Ben, Kyle...

156
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
...and Joey.The rest of you, thank you.

157
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
Yes! I knew it!

158
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
Bye-bye.

159
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
So long.

160
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
Later.

161
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
This is great!I might get to play Ben's dad.

162
00:08:14 --> 00:08:15
That can't happen.

163
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
Because you havesuch different looks...

164
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
...we're putting you with Raymondand Kyle with Ben.

165
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
So it'll either beyou two or you two.

166
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
- This is gonna be kind of weird.- Yeah, it is.

167
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.

168
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
No. We're like best friends.That's why it's weird.

169
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
I thought we were just talking.

170
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
Is it okay if I leave this heretill Rachel's birthday party?

171
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
- Sure. What's in them?- Cups.

172
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
Good, because we got Rachel800 gallons of water.

173
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
That's a lot of cups.

174
00:08:56 --> 00:08:57
I'm in charge of cups and ice.

175
00:08:57 --> 00:09:02
And Monica's gonna rue the dayshe put me in charge of cups and ice.

176
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
You know, I rued the day once.Didn't get a whole lot else done.

177
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
Okay, time to bring upthe rest of the cups.

178
00:09:13 --> 00:09:14
Ross, I'm glad you're here.

179
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
- I want to talk to you.- What's up?

180
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
I've been thinking about thiscommercial thing. Me against Ben.

181
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
The two of us competing.That can't lead to anything good.

182
00:09:25 --> 00:09:31
I think I'm just gonna step aside.I'll tell them that I won't audition.

183
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
Joey, that's great.Thanks, man.

184
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
That's it?

185
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
You're gonna let me do this?It's my career we're talking about!

186
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
But you just...

187
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
I said that soyou wouldn't let Ben do it.

188
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
If anyone should step aside,it should be Ben.

189
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
- What?- Chandler, tell him!

190
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
Well, let me get the door first.

191
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
Hi, no one!

192
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
Why should Ben step aside?

193
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
It was his audition in thefirst place. You tagged along.

194
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
You're like the tag-along dad!

195
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
I care about his feelings.

196
00:10:09 --> 00:10:09
What?

197
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
You know how hard it'll be on himwhen he doesn't get it?

198
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
And why wouldn't he get it?

199
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
Come on!

200
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
Have you seen what my kid can do?

201
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
He dials phones,he eats tortilla chips.

202
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
He plays soccerwith the cartoon tiger!

203
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
Are you saying your kid eats soupbetter than my kid?

204
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
You just give him a spoon, baby.

205
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see!

206
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
This commercial belongsto me and Mitch!

207
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
- Your kid's name is Raymond!- Yeah? So is yours!

208
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
- How did work go?- It was great.

209
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
I went down there like you said.And we talked business.

210
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
And Kim took my opinions.

211
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
You stink!

212
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
- Thanks.- No, I'm serious.

213
00:10:51 --> 00:10:52
Because I went downand they were smoking.

214
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
This is actually the smell of success.

215
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
But there's something different.

216
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
Oh, my God! You smoked!

217
00:11:00 --> 00:11:00
I did not.

218
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
Yes, you did. You lookhappy and sick. You smoked!

219
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
All right, fine! But I had to.I had to do it for my career.

220
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
I wish I had to smoke for my career.

221
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
That's so gross!

222
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
It's not that bad, you know?

223
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
Yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzyand my fingers sort of smell.

224
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
I actually feel like I could throw up.

225
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
But you gotta push past this, okay?Because it's about to get so good.

226
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
You smell so smoky,I gotta get up.

227
00:11:29 --> 00:11:30
I'm not kidding.

228
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
I think you smell great.

229
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
So we're decided.No on plaid, yes on pink.

230
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
Absolutely.

231
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
I'm so onboard.

232
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
- Didn't you just light that?- Yeah.

233
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
But you know what?

234
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
I'm just really, reallytrying to cut back, you know.

235
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
Good luck, Rach.

236
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
I've been thinking about quitting.

237
00:11:55 --> 00:11:56
Every Sunday night,I say I'm quitting.

238
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
Every Monday morning, it's like...

239
00:11:59 --> 00:11:59
Tell me about it.

240
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
We'll just quit.Let's all quit!

241
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
It sounds appealing.

242
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
- I never could do it.- But you could. Absolutely.

243
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
We can help each other.We could get those patches.

244
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
We could be like the Patch Sisters.

245
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
You know, we really should quit.Okay, let's quit!

246
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
Great! Give me those cigs.Come on!

247
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
Give it! Out. Done. Quit.

248
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
My late husband gave me that lighter.

249
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
I'm not kidding.

250
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
Okay, then.

251
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
Mmm... soup.

252
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
Mmm... soup.

253
00:12:35 --> 00:12:38
Would you mind watching Ben for mewhile I use the ladies' room?

254
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
- No problem.- Thanks.

255
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
So you want to be an actor?I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.

256
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
There's tons of rejection.No stability.

257
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
I mean, one day,you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.

258
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
The next day, you're eatingketchup out of the bottle.

259
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
I mean, Ben. Ben.

260
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
Raymond, Joey, you're up.

261
00:13:19 --> 00:13:23
All right, let's try one.Whenever you guys are ready.

262
00:13:24 --> 00:13:25
Is there a problem?

263
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
Well, this is noodle soup.And I've been working with tomato.

264
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
But that's okay. No problem.

265
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
Mmm... noodle soup.

266
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
You know, that's fine.But the line is, "Mmm... soup".

267
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
- What'd I say?- Mmm... noodle soup.

268
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
How's that different?

269
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
All right. Let's try one.

270
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
Mmm...

271
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
...noodle soup.

272
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
Let's do it again.

273
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
Mmm... soup.

274
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
I mean, noodle soup.I mean, soup!

275
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
Come on!

276
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
You know what?We need to move on.

277
00:14:09 --> 00:14:10
No, I could do it one more time.

278
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
Look.

279
00:14:12 --> 00:14:13
Mmm... noodle soup.

280
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
Damn it!

281
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
Busted!

282
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
Come on! What are you doing?I thought we were the Patch Sisters.

283
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
That didn't work out.

284
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
We tried to quit.But it was too hard.

285
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
If you started smoking again,you could have at least told me.

286
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
Give me one.What are we talking about?

287
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
Don't you give up.

288
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
That's why we didn't tell you,and we won't drag you down.

289
00:14:44 --> 00:14:45
Wait. No, no.Drag me down.

290
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
We're so proudof how well you're doing.

291
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
I won't let you blow it.If I catch you, you're fired.

292
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
Go on, get out of here.I don't want you breathing this stuff.

293
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
So, okay. You'll come with meon the Paris trip?

294
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
Oh, man!

295
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
Check it out.Cup hat, cup banner...

296
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
...cup chandelier and the thingthat started it all. The cup!

297
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
Great job with the cups.

298
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
Why don't you just go out with her?

299
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
Did you notice the ice? Look!

300
00:15:16 --> 00:15:21
We have it all. We have crushed,cubed and dry. Watch.

301
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
Mystical.

302
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
No one's eating my food.They're eating her snow cones!

303
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
There are snow cones?

304
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
- Go, go!- Thank you.

305
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
- Look, look!- Surprise!

306
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
What? My birthday is notfor another month.

307
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
That's the surprise.

308
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
Oh, my God, you guys!This is so great! It's so unexpected.

309
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
I mean, Chandler's birthday'seven before mine.

310
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
Surprise!

311
00:15:59 --> 00:16:02
This is so great!Look at all these...

312
00:16:02 --> 00:16:02
...cups.

313
00:16:03 --> 00:16:04
This is so weird.

314
00:16:05 --> 00:16:06
I was in charge of cups.

315
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
Oh, okay. Not so weird.

316
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
Listen, man. I'm sorrythe audition didn't go well.

317
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
Yeah, right.

318
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
No, really. I am, Joey.I feel bad.

319
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
Look, Ross.You don't have to, okay?

320
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
It's not your fault I suck.

321
00:16:24 --> 00:16:28
What kind of an actor can't even say,"Mmm... noodle soup"?

322
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
You know what? Maybe you didn'tmess up your audition because you suck.

323
00:16:34 --> 00:16:39
Maybe you messed up becauseyou care more about your godson.

324
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
What do you mean?

325
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
I think, subconsciously...

326
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
You lost me.

327
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
I think, on some level,you sabotaged...

328
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
...your own auditionso Ben would get the part.

329
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
Your way soundsa lot better than mine.

330
00:17:00 --> 00:17:01
It's not that I'm a bad actor.

331
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
No, it's just that I careso damn much about little Ben...

332
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
...that it was more importantfor me to see him succeed.

333
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
- There you go. Thank you.- Thank you.

334
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
- So did he get it?- No.

335
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
What are you gonna do?

336
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
Is Rachel Greene here?I'm meeting her for lunch.

337
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
She doesn't come down anymore.You'll find her on 10.

338
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
Okay, great.

339
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
So we talkedabout the presentation.

340
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
He wondered if one personwould be enough.

341
00:17:29 --> 00:17:32
And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."

342
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
I'll catch you guys later.
