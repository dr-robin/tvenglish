1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
It's so weird. How did Joeyend up kissing Charlie last night?

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:10
- I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.- I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:11
But surprise!

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
I missed most of the party.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
Charlie's a girl, right?

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
Yeah, she's this new professorin my department that I did not kiss.

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her.Of all the girls at the party, God!

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
- Why do you care so much?- Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?

9
00:00:31 --> 00:00:35
Because Ross is the father of my child.

10
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
You know, and I want himto hook up with lots of women.

11
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joeyand Charlie have anything in common.

12
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
I don't know. They seemed to havea shared interest in each other's tonsils.

13
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
Wow. Joey and a professor.Can you imagine if they had kids?

14
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
And if the kids got her intelligence...

15
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...

16
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
...those nerds would get laid!

17
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
All right. So, Ross, you'reokay with all this? I mean...

18
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
It's no big deal.I just met her. I'm fine with it.

19
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
God, I forgot how hot she was.

20
00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

21
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
- Oh, you know, I'll come with you.- Okay.

22
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
- So a professor, huh?- Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.

23
00:01:17 --> 00:01:20
Her mind is totally acrimonious.

24
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
Guess that's not how she used it.

25
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

26
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
I don't ordinarily go aroundkissing guys at parties.

27
00:01:33 --> 00:01:34
I'm...

28
00:01:35 --> 00:01:38
Well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I reallyhope you don't think less of me.

29
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
Think less of you? No.I don't think less of you.

30
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
I mean, you saw someone you likedand you kissed them.

31
00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
Those people who like someoneand don't kiss them...

32
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
...those people are stupid.I hate those people.

33
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
Actually, I'm a little surprisedat myself.

34
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
I mean, Joey's so differentfrom the guys I usually date.

35
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
They're all professors, intellectuals.Paleontologists mostly.

36
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
- You know, very cerebral...- Yeah, I know the type.

37
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
If we want to grab a bite before work,we'd better get acrimonious.

38
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
No?Am I getting close?

00:02:08 --> 00:02:09

42
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
- Hey!- Hi.

43
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
Hey, you guys.Look what I just got.

44
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
Oh, wow! I love those!Where did you get them?

45
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
I bought them off eBay. They usedto belong to the late Shania Twain.

46
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.

47
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
Oh, then I overpaid.

48
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
Hey, what's this?

49
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
Oh, it's a gift certificateto this new spa in SoHo.

50
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
You can't show Phoebe this. She hatesthose corporate massage chains.

51
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
What, now I can't get a massage?

52
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
There are so many thingsthat she disapproves of.

53
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
I can't eat veal. I can't wear fur.

54
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
I can't go hunting.

55
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
- Do you want to go hunting?- I would like to have the option.

56
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
What's that? Hey, Rachel?

57
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
No, you can't go there!

58
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
You know how I feel aboutthese big massage places.

59
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
They're putting people like meout of business.

60
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
She wants to go hunting too!

61
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
Phoebe, come on,I don't want to waste it.

62
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
It would be like throwingaway 100 bucks.

63
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
Okay, this is not aboutthe money. Okay?

64
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
It's about corporate greeddestroying our hearts...

65
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
...and leaving us hollow shells.

66
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
I don't care about any of that.

67
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
Well, do you care about friendship?I feel really strongly about this.

68
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
Please don't use this gift certificate.I'm asking you as a friend.

69
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!

70
00:04:10 --> 00:04:11
Fine. I won't use it.

71
00:04:11 --> 00:04:12
- Promise?- I promise.

72
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
- Thank you.- Well, I am going hunting.

73
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
Hey, honey. I missed you today.

74
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
- Oh, yeah?- Yeah. Hey.

75
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
- What do you wanna do tonight?- Oh, well, maybe we could...

76
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
Okay, trying to turn me onby making a mess?

77
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
Know your audience.

78
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
Besides, tomorrow we're doingthose fertility tests.

79
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
Until then, you need to keepyour tadpoles in the tank.

80
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
Do we really need to take those tests?

81
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
We've been tryingto have a baby for a year.

82
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
I think it's a good ideato find out if everything's okay.

83
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
- Just a few routine tests.- But I don't want to do it in a cup.

84
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
- What is the big deal?- It's weird! You're in a doctor's office.

85
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
It's not okay to do itin a doctor's office...

86
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
...but it is okay to do it ina parked car behind a Taco Bell?

87
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
I cannot believe Ross told you that.

88
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.

89
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
Look, I don't want to dothese tests either.

90
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
But I really do thinkit's a good idea.

91
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
I'm sure a doctor's officecan't be worse...

92
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
...than on a class tripto the Hershey factory.

93
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!

94
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
Who says wine has to costmore than milk?

95
00:05:40 --> 00:05:40
- Hey!- Hi.

96
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
- Come on in. How are you?- I'm good.

97
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
- Can I offer you a drink?- Please.

98
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
I have been crazed all day.

99
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
I had a meeting with the dean,my syllabus for summer school's due...

100
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
...and I'm writing the forewordfor a book.

101
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
I had a pretty hectic day at work too.Today I had to open a door and go:

102
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
So I am just so excited to be here.

103
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
- I can't wait to explore the city.- Lf you need a tour guide...

104
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
Oh, you mean it?That would be so fun.

105
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.What do you want to see first?

106
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
We could go see the Kronos Quartetat Avery Fisher Hall.

107
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Okay.

108
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
There's a collection of Walt Whitmanletters on display at the public library.

109
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
I know.

110
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
- But first, I have to see the Met.- Okay, let me stop you right there.

111
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
The Mets suck, okay?

112
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
You wanna see the Yankees.

113
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
No. No, not the Mets.The Met. Singular.

114
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
Which one? They all suck.

115
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
The museum.

116
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
I don't think so.

117
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
- Hi there.- Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.

118
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
How may I help you?

119
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
Hi. I have a massage appointmentunder Rachel Green.

120
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
- Okay.- And here is my gift certificate.

121
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
- This has been torn up.- And taped back together.

122
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
Okay. Well, I'll call you as soonas your massage therapist is ready.

123
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
- Okay.- Have a seat through the glass doors.

124
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
- Through the glass doors.- Through the glass doors.

125
00:07:11 --> 00:07:12
Alrighty then.

126
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
Phoebe, your next client'sin the waiting room.

127
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
Do we have to talk like thatwhen they're not around?

128
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Oh, no. No, no.

129
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
Listen, is there someonewho can fill in for me?

130
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
- Sorry. Everyone is booked.- That woman can't know I work here.

131
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
She's a friend of mineand I made this big stink...

132
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
...about how awfulthese massage chains are.

133
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
- Then why do you work here?- Because it's good money.

134
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
But that doesn't change the fact...

135
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
...that this is an evil, bloodsuckingcorporate machine.

136
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
Well, I think this is a great placeto work.

137
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
Okay, are they listening?

138
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
- Ross. Hey.- Hi.

139
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
I need to talk to you about Charlie.

140
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
Oh, do you? Do you really?

141
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
Yeah, I'm kind of havinga little problem.

142
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
Look, if you don't know what the word"acrimonious" means, just don't use it.

143
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
Look, you know Charlie, right?

144
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
- She's cool, funny, her body is so...- Get to the problem.

145
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
Right. She's just so much smarterthan all the girls I've ever dated.

146
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
Combined.

147
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
You know? And I just...I don't want her to think I'm stupid.

148
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
Are you wearing two belts?

149
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
Hey, what do you know?

150
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
You were saying you didn't wantto seem stupid.

151
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
Well, she wants to goto all these cultural places...

152
00:08:38 --> 00:08:42
...and I don't know how to talk aboutthat stuff. You gotta help me out.

153
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
I don't want to get involvedin your guys' relationship.

154
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
Oh, dude, please. Come on,you're the smartest person I know.

155
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
And I really like this girl, okay?I don't want to lose her.

156
00:08:53 --> 00:08:54
- Fine.- Thanks.

157
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
Okay. Let's see.

158
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
- Oh, you should take her to the Met.- The Mets.

159
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
No, no, no. The Met.The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

160
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
Oh, that's what she meant.

161
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
If they're gonna shorten it, theyshould call it the "Muse," you know?

162
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
Short for "museum"and avoid all the confusion.

163
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
Yeah, most days the place is packedwith confused, angry baseball fans.

164
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
Okay. All right,so I'll take her to the Met.

165
00:09:20 --> 00:09:25
Yeah. Okay. There's this greatrare bookstore on Madison Avenue.

166
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
You know what?She loves architecture.

167
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
You should take a walk down Fifthto the St. Patrick's Cathedral.

168
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
And there, there's this greatlittle pastry shop that she'd love.

169
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
Jeez. Sounds like youshould be going on this date.

170
00:09:36 --> 00:09:37
But I'm not.

171
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
- And you know what...?- Okay, slow down.

172
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
You're going way too fast.Okay? Just go back to the Met.

173
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
So you gotta tell me exactlywhat to do there.

174
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
When you walk into the museum,take a right, okay?

175
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
That's the antiquities wing.

176
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,up to the Byzantine Empire.

177
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
Okay. So I walk in the doorand make a right.

178
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
I have a weird feeling aboutthis place. How do I know...

179
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
...they won't secretly videotape meand put it all over the Internet?

180
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
Because, honey, and I mean thisin the sweetest way possible...

181
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.

182
00:10:21 --> 00:10:22
Mr. Bing? Here you are.

183
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
Go into that room and deposityour specimen into the container.

184
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
Deposit my specimen?

185
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
I usually have to call a 900 numberfor that kind of talk.

186
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
Thanks. Got it.

187
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
All right. Honey, my testsare down the hall.

188
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
- Are you sure you're gonna be okay?- Yeah, I guess.

189
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
Look, I know this is embarrassing,but nobody cares.

190
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
No one here even knows you.

191
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
Oh, my God!

192
00:10:51 --> 00:10:52
Oh, come on!

193
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
How great is this?

194
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
We're probably fertile.Let's go home.

195
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
Why are you here?

196
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
Sid and I are trying againand we had trouble last time...

197
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
No, no, no. I mean, why?Why is she here?

198
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
Oh, someone's a little cranky todaybecause they have to do it in a cup.

199
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.

200
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
What?

201
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
This was fun. But I've gotan invasive vaginal exam to get to.

202
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
I'd love to staybut I've got a hot date.

203
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
Please go. Just let me knowif you need a hand.

204
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
I think it just fell off.

205
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
Hello, "ja".

206
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
It's time for your massage, "ja"?

207
00:11:52 --> 00:11:53
Put your face in the hole.

208
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
A Swedish massagefrom a real Swedish person.

209
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
Okay, then I'm Swedish.

210
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
So, what's your name?

211
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
It's a normal Swedish name.

212
00:12:07 --> 00:12:08
Ikea.

213
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
- Wow. What an interesting name.- Yeah.

214
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
- You know, l...- Time for your scalp massage.

215
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
Wow. I really love your...

216
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
- Is something wrong?- No, it's just...

217
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
It just feels so good...

218
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
...Ikea.

219
00:12:27 --> 00:12:31
Hey, say, you'll know this.What's the capital of Sweden?

220
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
Stockholm.

221
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
Damn. I wish I knewif that was right.

222
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
Note the painterly linesand subtle impasto on this canvas.

223
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
Monet painted quickly,and usually outdoors...

224
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
...as his elusive subjectwas light itself.

225
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
Now, do you have any ideawhat you just said?

226
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
No, no. My mouth says the words,my brain is thinking "monster trucks."

227
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
Now, remember,when you get to the museum...

228
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.I just...

229
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
- I wrote that out phonetically for you.- Phonetically?

230
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
Yeah, that means...We just don't have time for this.

231
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
I gotta say, I'm really impressed youwere able to memorize all this so quickly.

232
00:13:15 --> 00:13:16
I'm an actor.I can memorize anything.

233
00:13:17 --> 00:13:18
Last week on "Days", I had to say:

234
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
"Frontal temporalzygomatic craniotomy."

235
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
- Wow. What does that mean?- No idea.

236
00:13:23 --> 00:13:26
But the guy I said it todies in the next scene...

237
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
...so I guess it means,"You'll get eaten by a bear."

238
00:13:32 --> 00:13:33
Okay.

239
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
- So let's move on to the Renaissance.- Okay.

240
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...

241
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
...to highlight the anguishof the central figure.

242
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
Touch it. It's really bumpy.

243
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
No, no, no. No ad-libbing. And, dude,you can't touch the paintings.

244
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49
- Come on.- No. No!

245
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
My specimen's in the room.

246
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
I just want to thank whoever knockedon the door while I was in there.

247
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
Really helped speed the process along.

248
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
Janice, you're not gone?

249
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
Sid is still in his room.

250
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
I don't allow porn at home,so this is like a vacation for him.

251
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
So did you do it?Did you make your deposit?

252
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
- Yeah. The hard part's over.- That's not the hard part, honey.

253
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
The hard part's what comes next.Aren't you worried about the results?

254
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
I haven't even thoughtabout the results.

255
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
I just assumed everythingwould be okay.

256
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
Well, you know what? It probably is.

257
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
But what if it's not okay?

258
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
I mean, what if there's a reasonwe can't have a baby?

259
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
Chandler. Look, you and Monicaare meant to have children.

260
00:14:39 --> 00:14:40
I'm sure it's gonna be just fine.

261
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. I can'tbelieve I didn't even think of that.

262
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
I guess I was so worried abouthaving to come here and do that.

263
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
You can do itin a Taco Bell parking lot...

264
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
...but you can't do itat a doctor's office?

265
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
It was a Wendy's!

266
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
And that's the Swedish national anthem.Thank you for asking.

267
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
Wow, lkea.

268
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
What a rich culture.

269
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
You know what?I have a friend who's a masseuse.

270
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
- Oh? "Ja", "ja"?- "Ja". She's not very good, though.

271
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
- And why do you think that is?- I don't know.

272
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
Maybe it's because she's gotsuch callousy fingers...

273
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
...from playing crummy guitar.

274
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
Or maybe she has troubleloosening your knots...

275
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
...because you're sucha high-maintenance tight-ass.

276
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
- Phoebe!- You know it's me?

277
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
Well, for like a half an hour!

278
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
Man, you can lie about Sweden!

279
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
How can you come here?

280
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
- Why didn't you tell me you work here?- I don't have to tell you everything!

281
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
You do if you're gonna make me feelguilty for getting a free massage.

282
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
Tip's not included.

283
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
Why did you lie to meabout working here?

284
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
Because I was ashamed, okay?I sold out for the cash.

285
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
And they give me benefits, like medicaland dental and a four-oh-wunk.

286
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
But, you know, you pay a price.Now I'm this corporate stooge...

287
00:16:20 --> 00:16:21
...and punching a clock...

288
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
...and paying taxes!

289
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
Phoebe, honey,if you hate it so much...

290
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
...you should walk out thereright now and quit.

291
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
Be true to what you believe in.

292
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
Honey, you have principles,and I so admire that.

293
00:16:35 --> 00:16:36
I don't have any.

294
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
You know what? You're right.I am gonna quit.

295
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
- It's time I took my life back.- Good for you, Pheebs.

296
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
If you guys have microphones inthere too, I didn't mean any of that.

297
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
I love you.

298
00:16:54 --> 00:16:58
Got you!Die! Die! Die!

299
00:16:58 --> 00:17:02
Respectfully, Professor R. Geller.

300
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
Hey, how was the Met?

301
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
The museum was amazing.

302
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?

303
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
Not so much, no.

304
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
He had clearly memorizedall this stuff to say...

305
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
...and some of it didn'teven make any sense.

306
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
- What do you mean?- Well, for one...

307
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
...he was talking about paintingsthat were nowhere around.

308
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
Wait a minute. When you guys walkedinto the Met, did you go to the right?

309
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
- No. No, we went to the left.- Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.

310
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
Still, it seems like you guysare having a great time together.

311
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

312
00:17:39 --> 00:17:40
What?

313
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
Actually, Joey's your friend...

314
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
...and you don't know me that well.It'd be weird.

315
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
Well, I mean, a little.But no, what? Go on.

316
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
Well...

317
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
I'm thinking that maybe Joeyisn't the right guy for me right now.

318
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
You know, maybe I shouldbe with someone...

319
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
...I have more in common with.You know what I mean?

320
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
Yeah.

321
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
Yeah, but you know what?

322
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
I think you should give Joey a chance.

323
00:18:09 --> 00:18:11
I mean, he's a great guy.

324
00:18:11 --> 00:18:13
And sure, he doesn't knowthat much about art...

325
00:18:13 --> 00:18:15
...but you can always talk aboutthat with someone else.

326
00:18:15 --> 00:18:17
- I guess that's true.- Lf you think about it...

327
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
...he memorized all that stuff becausehe thought it was important to you.

328
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23
You know, that's the kind of guyJoey is.

329
00:18:23 --> 00:18:25
He is very sweet.

330
00:18:25 --> 00:18:26
Plus, he is hot!

331
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
That was gonna be my next argument.

332
00:18:32 --> 00:18:34
- You ready?- Yeah. Let's go.

333
00:18:34 --> 00:18:35
Wow!

334
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
- Thanks, Ross.- Yeah.

335
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.You hooked me up.

336
00:18:43 --> 00:18:44
Glad I could help, man.

337
00:18:44 --> 00:18:48
Some of the stuff wasn't where you saidit would be, but I made it work.

338
00:18:56 --> 00:18:59
It is not okay that I'm arousedby this now.

339
00:19:02 --> 00:19:03
Hello?

340
00:19:03 --> 00:19:06
Oh. Hi, Dr. Connelly.

341
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
No. Well, she's not here...

342
00:19:08 --> 00:19:09
...but I can tell her.

343
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
Should I be sitting down for this?

344
00:19:24 --> 00:19:26
Well, so, what does that mean?

345
00:19:30 --> 00:19:32
Okay. Okay, thank you.

346
00:19:32 --> 00:19:33
Thanks.

347
00:19:38 --> 00:19:39
Hey, sweetie.

348
00:19:40 --> 00:19:41
Dr. Connelly just called.

349
00:19:41 --> 00:19:43
With good news?Of course it's not good news.

350
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
You said, "Dr. Connelly just called."

351
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
If it was good, you'd have said,"Dr. Connelly just called!"

352
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
So, what is it? Is it...?

353
00:19:50 --> 00:19:53
Is there a problem? Is therea problem with me, or with you?

354
00:19:54 --> 00:19:56
Actually, it's both of us.

355
00:19:57 --> 00:19:58
What?

356
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
Apparently, my spermhave low motility...

357
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
...and you havean inhospitable environment.

358
00:20:11 --> 00:20:13
Well, what does that mean?

359
00:20:13 --> 00:20:16
It means that my guys won'tget off their Barcaloungers...

360
00:20:16 --> 00:20:19
...and you have a uterus that isprepared to kill the ones that do.

361
00:20:21 --> 00:20:23
- It means...- Wait, Chandler.

362
00:20:27 --> 00:20:29
It means that we can keep trying...

363
00:20:29 --> 00:20:32
...but there's a good chancethis may never happen for us.

364
00:20:37 --> 00:20:39
Oh, my God.

365
00:20:40 --> 00:20:42
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:42 --> 00:20:43
I'm sorry too.

367
00:20:46 --> 00:20:48
Well...

368
00:20:48 --> 00:20:50
...we're gonna figure this out.

369
00:20:53 --> 00:20:54
I know.

370
00:21:07 --> 00:21:10
- Good morning, Phoebe.- Good morning, receptionist.

371
00:21:10 --> 00:21:13
Here's your schedule for the day.Your first client is in Room 1.

372
00:21:14 --> 00:21:17
"Rachel Green."Son of a bitch! She came back?

373
00:21:23 --> 00:21:26
Are you readyfor your Scottish massage?

374
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
Put your face in the hole, lassie!
