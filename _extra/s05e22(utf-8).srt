1
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
What's going on?

2
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
My eye is a little itchy.

3
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Mine too. Yeah.

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
It's really red.You should go see my eye doctor.

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
I'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
That's all I hear.Richard, Richard, Richard.

7
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
Since we've dated,I've said his name twice.

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
Okay. So Richard, Richard.

9
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
It's not Richard.It's this new guy. He's good.

10
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
I'm sorry. I'm not goingto an eye doctor.

11
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
Oh, God. Here we go.

12
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
Anytime anything comes closeto touching her eye or anyone else's...

13
00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
...she, like, freaks out. Watch.

14
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
Ross, come on!

15
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
I have a weird thing with my eye.Can we not talk about it?

16
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?"Me, myself and eye".

17
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
Monica! Come on!

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
All those in favorof getting lunch, say "eye".

19
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
Ross! Stop it!

20
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
The King and "Eye"!

21
00:01:01 --> 00:01:01
Chandler!

22
00:01:02 --> 00:01:02
Me too, me too!

23
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
Just stop it! That's enough!

24
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
- You okay there, man?- Yeah. I got too excited.

25
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
The One with Joey's Big Break

26
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
I gotta go.I'm taking Ben to the park.

27
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
- Give him a kiss for me.- All right. Bye.

28
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
Later.

29
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
I'm so sorry you got caughtin the middle of that.

30
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
I didn't mean to be so out there,but I am furious with him.

31
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
Calm down?

32
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
I'm trying.Man, that guy can push my buttons!

33
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
Why are you so mad?

34
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
- I don't wanna talk about it.- It seems like...

35
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
You wanna be on my list too?Keep talking.

36
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
Has anyone seen my list by the way?

37
00:02:20 --> 00:02:21
No. What's it look like?

38
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
- A piece of paper and it says "Ross".- I see.

39
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
I just got off the phone with Estelle.Guess what?

40
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
I got the lead!

41
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
You got the lead in a movie?What's it about?

42
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
It's called "Shutterspeed".It's really cool.

43
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
I meet this girl in the subwayand we fall in love in, like, a day.

44
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
And then she disappears.But I find out where she lives.

45
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
This old lady answers the door.I say, "Where's Betsy?"

46
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
And she says, "Betsy's been deadfor ten years."

47
00:02:52 --> 00:02:52
Chilling!

48
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
The best part is we're filmingin the desert outside of Vegas.

49
00:02:56 --> 00:02:57
- You know what that means.- I know.

50
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
Road trip! We can rent a car.I have to be there by Tuesday.

51
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
Wait! My grandmother's dead.

52
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
We can talk about that too, Pheebs.

53
00:03:10 --> 00:03:10
No, her cab.

54
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
She probably won't be using it.Drive it to Las Vegas.

55
00:03:13 --> 00:03:14
All right! Thanks!

56
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
What are we gonna do about my job?

57
00:03:17 --> 00:03:18
Not go.

58
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
Great! Road trip, baby!

59
00:03:21 --> 00:03:21
Is this okay?

60
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
Chandler, you don't have to askfor my permission.

61
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
You can go.

62
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
Rach, we'll be latefor the eye doctor.

63
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
All right. Let's get this over with.

64
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
Look what I did.

65
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
I mean, look at this mess.

66
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
We're gonna probably have toclean this up.

67
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule!

68
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
If you thought that this messwas gonna bother me, you are wrong!

69
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
All right, let's go, Blinky.

70
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Hey, Joey. What's up?

71
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
I can't decide which routeto take to Vegas.

72
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
You've traveled a lot, right?

73
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
Yeah, I've been around.

74
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
Which route should I take?The north or the south route?

75
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
If you take the north route,there's a man with a beard of bees.

76
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
Great! Problem solved!

77
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
On the south route, there's a chickenthat plays tic-tac-toe.

78
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Well, back to square one.

79
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
I know a way that you can decide.

80
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
I'll ask you a series of questionsand you answer as quickly as you can.

81
00:04:30 --> 00:04:30
Yes!

82
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
Good. But wait.

83
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Here we go. I want you to relax.

84
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
Take a deep breath.

85

00:04:43 --> 00:04:46

I always thought it'd be Rachel.

90
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
- No thinking. Tie or ascot?- Ascot.

91
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52

96
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Not much. Wanna see a movie tonight?

97
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
What do you wanna see?

98
00:05:08 --> 00:05:09
I don't know.

99
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
I know how to decide.Show him your game.

100
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
No, thank you.

101
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
What's with her?

102
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
I don't know.I know how we can decide.

103
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20

104
00:05:20 --> 00:05:21

105
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25

Dude, you are sick.

107
00:05:31 --> 00:05:35
I'm sorry. I forgot you hadthat whole Rachel thing.

108
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?

109
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
- An eye removal machine.- I'm out of here.

110
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
I'm kidding.

111
00:05:46 --> 00:05:47
Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.

112
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
Monica said you were nervous.Everything will be fine.

113
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
- So we're done.- Almost, but first we gotta start.

114
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
This is a glaucoma test. Sit down.

115
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
Put your chin here.

116
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
Now, you'll feel a small puff of airin each eye.

117
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
What?

118
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
A small puff of air.Now, come on!

119
00:06:07 --> 00:06:08
Here we go.

120
00:06:08 --> 00:06:12
One, two, three.

121
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
I'm sorry. All right.

122
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
I'm gonna stay in here this time.

123
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
Ready?

124
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
- One, two...- I'm sorry.

125
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
You know what?I'm gonna hold her head.

126
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
That's okay.

127
00:06:26 --> 00:06:27
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
You're young.You don't have glaucoma.

129
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
So it was very, very niceto meet you, sir.

130
00:06:36 --> 00:06:37
What are you...Are you crazy?

131
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
You got a small, minor infectionin that left eye.

132
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
Take these drops for a weekand you'll be as good as new.

133
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
No, I don't put things in my eye.

134
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
We'll see you here in three months.And I'll fit you for a glass eye.

135
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Give me the damn drops!

136
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
Dr. Miller?

137
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
P-E-C-F-D.

138
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
Very good, Monica!

139
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
- You know where they are.- I sure do.

140
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
And you don't get one.

141
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
You know, those eye dropsare a miracle.

142
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
My eye is 100% better.

143
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
- They're still in my coat.- Damn!

144
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
You ready to go?

145
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
How cold will it be there?Will all these sweater vests be enough?

146
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
- What?- I love you.

147
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
I wish Ross was coming with us.I'll miss him.

148
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
Thanks. I just gotthat jerk out of my mind.

149
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
Is the movie putting us upin a big hotel suite?

150
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
Not really.It's an independent film.

151
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
We don't have a big budget.I'll stay in your room.

152
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
Once you get paid,you'll be springing for a suite.

153
00:07:44 --> 00:07:45
They must be paying you a lot.

154
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
For every dollar "Shutterspeed" makes...

155
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
...one penny of it goesright in Joey's pocket.

156
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
You don't get paid unlessit makes money?

157
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
Did you not hear the plotof the movie?

158
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
"She's been dead for ten years."

159
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

160
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
I wanted to say goodbye.

161
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
And to see if you guys wouldplace a little bet for me.

162
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
Twenty bucks on black 15.

163
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
- You got it!- All right.

164
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
- All right. Bye-bye, now.- Bye, you guys.

165
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
I'll say bye at the car.

166
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
Anyone wanna say bye to meat the car?

167
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
I'll say goodbye to you at the carif you don't mind the pus.

168
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
See you!

169
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
But wait a minute. The pus is good.It means it's healing.

170
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
Hey, Pheebs. What you reading?

171
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40

173
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

174
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
Pheebs, are you mad at meor something?

175
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
If you are, please tell mewhat it is I did.

176
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
- If you don't know, I can't help you.- I don't know.

177
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Well, I can't help you.

178
00:08:58 --> 00:09:03
Well, whatever it is,I am very, very sorry. Okay?

179
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
Apology accepted.

180

So we're good?

181

I'll see you later, okay?

182
00:09:13 --> 00:09:14
Bye, fat ass.

183
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
All right!

184
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
Will you please tell me what it isthat made you so mad at me?

185
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
I don't know! I don't remember!

186
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
If you can't remember,can't we just forget about this?

187
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
Oh, no. I am mad at you.I know that much.

188
00:09:28 --> 00:09:33
But I'm sorry about the "fat ass" thingbecause you have a sweet, little heinie.

189
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
I'm getting pretty tired.You'll have to take over soon.

190
00:09:42 --> 00:09:46
We've been driving for a half-hour.You haven't looked at the road once.

191
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
Don't worry. It's out there.

192
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
Maybe I just need lunch.You wanna eat?

193
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
My treat.

194
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
Isn't that Ross' money?

195
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
Ross' treat.Where do you wanna eat?

196
00:10:00 --> 00:10:00
I don't know.

197
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
I know how we can decide.

198
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
I'll ask you questions.

199
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
And then you have to answer real fast.

200
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
So clear your mind.Clear it right out. Clear it out.

201
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
- Would you rather be too wet or too dry?- Too dry.

202
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
- Do you believe in ghosts?- No.

203
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
- Will this movie be my big break?- No.

204
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
- What?- Yes.

205
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
- Dude, you said, "No."- I also said, "Yes."

206
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
- This won't be my big break?- No.

207
00:10:26 --> 00:10:27
I don't believe this.

208
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
Look, I just don't want you to getyour hopes up too high.

209
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
What are you talking about?I'm the lead in a movie!

210
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
They're not even paying you!This doesn't sound like a real movie!

211
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
I don't know why you're dumpingall over my big break.

212
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
I don't think this is gonna beyour big break.

213
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
Are you on this tripto make me feel like a loser?

214
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
- I'd rather be alone.- You don't want me here?

215
00:10:46 --> 00:10:47
Not if you're like this.

216
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
The next time you ask mea question like that, I'll lie.

217
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
I don't want you on the trip.

218
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
Why don't you pull over?I'll get out now.

219
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
Fine.

220
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
Get out.

221
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
You can't stop on a bridge.

222
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
- Get out!- Fine!

223
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk!

224
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
Yeah. I'm gonna die here.

225
00:11:10 --> 00:11:14
Are you mad at mebecause my hair gel smells?

226
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
Because I said your handwritingis childlike?

227
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
No. That made me feel precious.

228
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
Because he's alwayscorrecting people's grammar?

229
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
"Whom, whom." Sometimes it's "who"!

230
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
Yeah? Sometimes it's...

231
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
Did you beat him at a board game?He's such a baby when he loses.

232
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
Okay, I'm the baby.

233
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
Hey! Stop it!

234
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
What are you doing here?

235
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
Joey kicked me out of the caron the bridge.

236
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
- Why?- I don't know. He went crazy.

237
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
We played that game where youask questions and answer fast.

238
00:11:46 --> 00:11:50
That game should not be playedwithout my supervision.

239
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
I don't know what made him mad.

240
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
All I said was thatthis wouldn't be his big break...

241
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
...that it wouldn't doanything for him...

242
00:11:56 --> 00:11:57
...and that it didn't sound real.

243
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
Okay, he should'vepushed me off the bridge.

244
00:12:00 --> 00:12:00
What's in the bag?

245
00:12:01 --> 00:12:02
I figured you'd be mad at me...

246
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
...so I got gifts that I foundon the roadside.

247
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
- Who wants the one-legged teddy bear?- I do!

248
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
- Not even close.- I need help! I can't do this.

249
00:12:18 --> 00:12:19
Come on. Let's do it.

250
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
Sit down.All right, put your head back.

251
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
- Now, open your eyes.- Okay, they are.

252
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
- How many fingers am I holding up?- Four.

253
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
I was thinking four.

254
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
- Really?- Yes!

255
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
Why don't we startwith a practice one?

256
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
- No drops.- Great!

257
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
On three. One, two, three.

258
00:12:41 --> 00:12:42
My pillow's all wet!

259
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
Well, you said it was practice!

260
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
Why did you move?

261
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
I knew you were lying!

262
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
- Come here.- What are you doing?

263
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
Stop it! Oh, my God!

264
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
I am going...

265
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
Turn it over!

266
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
I am going to get...

267
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
...get these drops in your eye.

268
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
Oh, my God! You really arefreakishly strong.

269
00:13:03 --> 00:13:04
Stop! Stop!

270
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
Stop it!

271
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
Damn, it's empty!

272
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
If Joey and Chandler walked in now,we could make a fortune.

273
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
That is definitely Chandler,Joey or Ross.

274
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
Or Rachel.

275
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
It's Joey.

276
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
Chandler told me what happened.He's really upset.

277
00:13:29 --> 00:13:34
Not as upset as he'll be when he findsout what I did with his sweater vests.

278
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
What did you do to them?

279
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
There's a well-dressedpack of dogs in Ohio.

280
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
I gotta ask Phoebesomething about the car.

281
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
Hold on one second.

282
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
- Hey, Pheebs.

283
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
This wooden box keeps sliding out.What is it?

284
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
My grandma.

285
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
And thanks.She's having a great time.

286
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.

287
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
Chandler's here.He was wondering if...

288
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
I guess he ran out of change.

289
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
How am I gonna apologize to himif he won't even talk to me?

290
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
Send him something. So when hegets there, he'll know you're sorry.

291
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
That's a good idea. I wonder whereI could get a basket of porn?

292
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
No, don't say I'm sorry with porn.

293
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
You should send hima carton of cigarettes.

294
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
Because that way he can trade itfor protection.

295
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
No. That's prison.

296
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
I know how we're gonnafigure this out.

297
00:14:30 --> 00:14:30
Clear your mind...

298
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
...and answer the first thingthat comes into your head.

299
00:14:35 --> 00:14:36
- Do you like flora or fauna?- Fauna.

300
00:14:37 --> 00:14:38
- Simon or Garfunkel?- Garfunkel.

301
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
- Why are you mad?- You said I was boring.

302
00:14:43 --> 00:14:44
When did I say that?

303
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
Oh, my God! I remember now!We were playing chess.

304
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
Phoebe, you and Ihave never played chess.

305
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
Remember that time on the frozen lake?We were playing. You said I was boring.

306
00:14:53 --> 00:14:58
Then you took off your energy maskand you were Cameron Diaz.

307
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
There's a chance thismay have been a dream.

308
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
Stanley!

309
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
Your leading man is here.Let's get to work.

310
00:15:29 --> 00:15:30
Slight change of plans.

311
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
We've shut down.

312
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33
What? Why?

313
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
It's a money thing.We don't have any.

314
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
You're kidding, right?

315
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
What?

316
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
It's probably just temporary.

317
00:15:42 --> 00:15:45
We're hoping to get some money soon.Just hang out.

318
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
Hang out? How long?

319
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
I don't know. A week. Maybe two.The money'll turn up.

320
00:15:50 --> 00:15:53
People always wanna invest in movies.You're not rich?

321
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
Worth a shot.

322
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
Well, Joey. Let me knowwhere you're staying, okay?

323
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?

324
00:16:03 --> 00:16:04
These got left for you.

325
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
Thanks.

326
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
"Congratulations on your big break."

327
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
- Monica, it's Joey.- Hey, Joey.

328
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
You remember meeven though you're a star.

329
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
before I forget you.

330
00:16:44 --> 00:16:45
What's it like on a movie set?

331
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
Do you have a dressing roomand a chair with your name?

332
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.

333
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
have been more wrong.

334
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
I gotta go, Monica. My sushi's here.

335
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
Sorry about that.Thanks for waiting.

336
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
Everybody smile.

337
00:17:05 --> 00:17:10
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stayat Caesar's. We hope it's toga-rific.

338
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
Kill me. Kill me now.

339
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
Rach, can you pass me the "TV Guide"?

340
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
Go!

341
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
What are you doing?Get off! Oh, my God!

342
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
Hold it open. Okay.

343
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
We'll see you in aboutthree or four hours.
