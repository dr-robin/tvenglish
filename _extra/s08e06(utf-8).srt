1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
- Guys, guess what?- What?

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
We're having a Halloween party!

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
- Good!- Great!

4
00:00:07 --> 00:00:11
- You have to wear a costume.- I can't make it.

5
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
Come on, it'll be fun.

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:16
I'll be there. I have to wear acostume to my classes that day anyway.

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
Tell me you're not gonna dresslike a dinosaur.

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
Not two years in a row.

9
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
- I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.- You have to.

10
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,pretending to be someone you're not.

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
You're an actor.

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
- I will.- The girl from the wedding?

14
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
If she needs costume ideas,she could be a bikini model...

15
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
...or a slutty nurse,or a sexy cheerleader.

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
Or Leatherface from "Texas Chainsaw""Massacre." No! Slutty Leatherface.

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Wasn't Joey hitting on her too?

18
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
That's right, he was hitting on her.

19
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
And I got her. I guessthe better man won.

20
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
Please don't take her from me.

35
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
Wait. If you want to come,I guess that'd be okay.

36
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
- Really?- Sure.

37
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
You could be my sister for the day.

38
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
Yeah, okay.

39
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
My friends are having a party tonight,so you could come.

40
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
Maybe I could meet the guy.

41
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Well, I'm supposed to work tonight.

42
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
I'm supposed to be working now,so who cares!

43
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
- It's a costume party.- So that's why you're...

44
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
No.

45
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
But thanks.

46
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
- You're supposed to wear a costume.- I am.

47
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
I am a woman who spent moneyon a dress she wants to wear...

48
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
...because soon she won'tfit into it.

49
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
I'm Catwoman, who wants the dresswhen you're too big for it.

50
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
- Trick or treat!- Can I give out candy?

51
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
I want to be with kids. Since I gotpregnant, I have maternal instincts.

52
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
- Trick or treat!- Just a minute!

53
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Look at you guys!

54
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
- Wow! You are a very scary witch.- Thank you.

55
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
- And you are a very funny clown.- Thank you.

56
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
And you...

57
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
...are so in style right now.

58
00:03:12 --> 00:03:17
I work at Ralph Lauren. The fall linehas got this equestrian theme.

59
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21
- Did you see the cover of "Vogue"...?- Could I just have the candy?

60
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
Sure.

61
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
Catwoman. So we meet again.

62
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
So we do, Supergirl.

63
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
It's me, Phoebe.

64
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
Monica, can I talk to youfor a second?

65
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
I appreciate the costume.

66
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
You did this to him?

67
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
I thought he'd love it.

68
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
- He loves "The Velveteen Rabbit."- That rabbit was brown and white.

69
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
It was pink, or no bunny at all.

70
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
No bunny at all.Always no bunny at all!

71
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
- You didn't dress up either?- Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.

72
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
Dude, what happened?

73
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
How is that me?

74
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
I'm Chandler.

75
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
That is so you!

76
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
- When have I ever done that?- When have I ever done that?

77
00:04:27 --> 00:04:28
Trick or treat.

78
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
- You're the prettiest ballerina ever.- Thank you.

79
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
That deserves another candy.

80
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Thank you.

81
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
I have to say,that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.

82
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
I love you!

83
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
Honey, here, take it all.

84
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
Monica? We need more candy.

85
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
- There's only been four kids.- I know.

86
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
But one said she loved me,so I gave her everything.

87
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
No wonder you're pregnant.

88
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
- What are you supposed to be?- Remember the satellite, Sputnik?

89
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"...

90
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
...and these are my antenna.

91
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
So Sputnik becomes...?

92
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
Spud-nik!

93
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Wow! I don't havethe worst costume anymore.

94
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
All right! Ross came as doodie.

95
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
- No, I'm not doodie.- No, space-doodie.

96
00:05:48 --> 00:05:49
Hey, sweetie.

97
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
- Aren't you gonna kiss me?- Okay.

98
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
But right after, you have to tell mewho you are.

99
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
- Ursula?- Ursula's fiance?

100
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
You're the sister. I just slappedmy future sister-in-law's ass.

101
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
Is your mother here?I could slap her on the butt.

102
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
- My mother killed herself.- See, and I knew that.

103
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Now I'm sweating.

104
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
I'm sweating. Now I'm saying lookat me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.

105
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
No. We'll start over.

106
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.- Eric.

107
00:06:20 --> 00:06:24
- Why are you looking at me like that?- Sweat's burning my eyes.

108
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
- Thank you.- There.

109
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
- What are you?- There's no name for it.

110
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

111
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
- No, I meant your costume.- I'm a solar system.

112
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
My second graders helped.

113
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
- I love the second grade.- Really?

114
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
It's much better than first grade,and definitely better than third.

115
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
With all the politicsand the mind games.

116
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
- So, what do you do?- I'm a masseuse, by day.

117
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
- You don't have to stay with me.- I'm having fun.

118
00:06:55 --> 00:07:00
- I'm excited for you and Ursula.- I feel very lucky. She's great.

119
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
- She's the most beautiful woman ever.- Thank you.

120
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
- Hey, Joey?- Yeah?

121
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
- You read comic books, right?- Exclusively.

122
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
Who would win in a fight,Catwoman or Supergirl?

123
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
- Catwoman, hands down.- Yeah.

124
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
Between you and Phoebe?I'd give Phoebe the edge.

125
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
- What? Really?- You kidding?

126
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?Plus, she's got a crazy temper.

127
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
She's not right behind me, is she?

128
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
- No, you're fine.- Okay.

129
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
- Could I take Rachel?- I'm not sure.

130
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
What? Come on, I am tough!

131
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

132
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
Relax. Why are you so serious?It doesn't matter.

133
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
Really? What if I told youRoss or Chandler could beat you up?

134
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
I would say, "Woman, please."

135
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
Ursula's fiance is really sweet.

136
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
He's a teacher,he does volunteer work.

137
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.But I could just mop him up.

138
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
- Oh, my God, Phoebe?- What?

139
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
- You're getting a crush on him.- No, I'm not, you are!

140
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
Here comes the temper.

141
00:08:10 --> 00:08:10
Trick or treat.

142
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
Know what? We're out of candy.But someone went for more.

143
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
And I've been giving out money,but I'm out of that too.

144
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
- Can I write you a check?- Okay.

145
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
- Okay. What's your name?- Lelani Mayolanofavich.

146
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
Okay, I'm just gonna write this outto "cash."

147
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
- Hi.- Hi, Mona.

148
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He washoping you'd be a slutty nurse.

149
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
Actually, I'm just a nurse.

150
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
You'd think that would embarrass me,but I'm maxed out.

151
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
- You made it.- Wait.

152
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
- You're a potato?- Well, I'm a spud...?

153
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
- And the antenna... You're Spud-nik!- Yes!

154
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
Marry her.

155
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
Here's a good one. Who'd wina fight between Ross and Chandler?

156
00:09:02 --> 00:09:03
I can't. Chandler's my husband.

157
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
- So Ross?- Yeah.

158
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
- Hey, beautiful.- Hello, handsome.

159
00:09:09 --> 00:09:10
Oh, God.

160
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
Look at you two.When did you guys meet?

161
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
- Two weeks ago.- That's it?

162
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
I know. It sounds crazy,and I'm not impulsive, but...

163
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
...we have so much in common.- Oh, really?

164
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
We're both teachers.

165
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
- And we were both in the Peace Corps.- Peace Corps, really?

166
00:09:31 --> 00:09:36
When we were building in Uruguay,we were two towns apart and never met.

167
00:09:36 --> 00:09:40
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I gotthere, but it was a town when I left.

168
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
- Shall we get me really drunk?- Sure.

169
00:09:48 --> 00:09:49
Howdy, doodie.

170
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
That's funny, yeah.

171
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
You're the funniest man here in abunny costume his wife made him wear.

172
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
Relax, man. You're lookinga little "flushed."

173
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
- Our question might get answered.- What question?

174
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
Who could kick whose ass in a fight,you or Ross?

175
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
- There's no question.- So you think Ross too?

176
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
- You picked Ross?- Ross is strong.

177
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
He's the strongest out of all threeof you. Except for Joey.

178
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
- I can't believe you didn't pick me.- She's right. I am stronger.

179
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
I would destroy you.

180
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
Really? You think you're stronger?Why don't you prove it?

181
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
I'll prove it like a theorem!

182
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
All right! Stop it!

183
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

184
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
People came to see a fight,let's give them one!

185
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
- You guys could arm-wrestle.- Listen to the slutty nurse.

186
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
- You're going down.- Oh, yeah? You're going downtown!

187
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
Seriously, guys, the trash talkis embarrassing.

188
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
Gunther, you brought candy.Thank you so much.

189
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
- You are so sweet.- Really?

190
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
You are gonna make some manthe luckiest guy in the world.

191
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
- Got to go.- Trick or treat.

192
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
Hi! Wow! There you go.

193
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
My friend Lewis told meyou were giving out money.

194
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
We were, but now we've got candy.

195
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
I'd rather have the money.

196
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
That's not your choice.Happy Halloween!

197
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
This isn't fair.

198
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
Is it fair that you put on a capeand get stuff?

199
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
Shut up!

200
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
You shut up!

201
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
- You can't tell me to shut up.- I think I just did.

202
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
And here it comes again. Shut up!

203
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.

204
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
Wait, I had one more thing to say.Right. Shut up.

205
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
You're a mean old woman.

206
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Wait! Shut... Don't cry!

207
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
Let me get my checkbook!

208
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
You don't have to do this. Thestrength inside you means the most.

209
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
You're loyal, you're honestand you have integrity.

210
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
That's the strength I want in a man.

211
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
That means nothing to me. Come on!

212
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
- Hi, liar.- Hey.

213
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
He's marrying you because he thinksthe things you were saying were true.

214
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
- They could be true.- But they're not.

215
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
It's a fine line.

216
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
- Why are you lying?- I don't know.

217
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
He did this stuff, I said I did ittoo. He got so excited, it was fun.

218
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
It's a disgusting habit,and I want you to quit now!

219
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
She's helped so many people quit.

220
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
We'd better get going.

221
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
- You have a church group meeting.- Right.

222
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
- It was nice meeting you.- You too.

223
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
And, Ursula, it was really nicemeeting you tonight!

224
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
Come on! Bunny versus Doodie.We're waiting!

225
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Okay, guys. One match,winner take all.

226
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
Wait. What does the winner get?

227
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
- Pride.- And dignity.

228
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Okay, if you say so.

229
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
All right, ready, set, go!

230
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
- Come on!- Come on!

231
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
- Wow, they're both really strong.- Or equally weak.

232
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
Oh, God. Chandler's makinghis sex face.

233
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
- So you getting tired?- No. I could do this all day.

234
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
Yeah. Me too.

235
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
- Getting a little tired, though.- God, I'm exhausted.

236
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
This is starting to look bad for me,okay? Mona's standing right there.

237
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
She's talking to Joey!You've got to let me win!

238
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
Let me win.My wife thinks I'm a wimp.

239
00:13:47 --> 00:13:52
At least you have a wife.I get divorces and knock people up.

240
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
And I'm dressed as doodie.

241
00:13:56 --> 00:14:01
- You're Spud-nik.- Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.

242
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
Please? She's watching.

243
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
- Fine.- Thanks.

244
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
- Oh, no.- Oh, yeah!

245
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
My hero!

246
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
You're a weird lady.

247
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
Ursula said she left her purse.

248
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
What a relief. It has the numbersfor her prayer chain.

249
00:14:22 --> 00:14:23
I'm sure it does.

250
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
Guess I'll see you at the wedding.

251
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
I don't think I'm gonna make itto the wedding.

252
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
- I wish you all the luck in the world.- We'll be okay.

253
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
It's so perfect,and she's been saving herself for me.

254
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
- I can't let you do this. She's lying.- What?

255
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
She is lying. And I betI could prove it. Excuse me.

256
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

257
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
But what looks like a detailed drawingof a bank floor plan.

258
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
Here's the name tag fromwhere she works as a waitress.

259
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
Not a teacher, a waitress.

260
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
Here, she always lies about this.

261
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
- How old did she say she was?- She told me she was 25.

262
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
I almost don't want to show you.

263
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

264
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
I am so stupid.

265
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
Of course she's not a teacher.

266
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
There's no such thing as a "Top SecretSchool for the Children of Spies."

267
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
No, you're not stupid.

268
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
I'm not smart.

269
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
I just wanted so muchto be impulsive for once.

270
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
- To be romantic.- Good.

271
00:15:34 --> 00:15:39
You should be impulsive and romantic.You did it with the wrong person.

272
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
- What?- It's weird, two people look so alike.

273
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
And so different.

274
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
Eric! Let's go!

275
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
- Better go deal with it.- Yeah, you should.

276
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
Hurry up! I gotta pray!

277
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
I had to give the kid50 bucks to stop crying.

278
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
That's not bad.

279
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
I also had to go to a few housesas his girlfriend.

280
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
I am awful with children.

281
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
You're good with kids.They're just crazy on Halloween.

282
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
They're all greedy,hopped up on sugar.

283
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
- That's all it is?- Absolutely.

284
00:16:29 --> 00:16:34
Halloween is the worst. Exceptfor Christmas. And their birthdays.

285
00:16:34 --> 00:16:37
They get crazy during the summer too.

286
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
And any time they'rehungry or sleepy.

287
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
Kids are tough.Good luck with that.

288
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
Look, I'm sorry you lost.

289
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
I got a secret for you.I let him win.

290
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
Was that a secret, or a lie?

291
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
- No, I let him... Ross?- Yeah?

292
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
Would you tell herI let you win, please?

293
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
Chandler "let me win."

294
00:17:02 --> 00:17:07
No, Chandler's really strong.My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

295
00:17:07 --> 00:17:10
I am strong. I'll show you.

296
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
Chandler, please.

297
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
What's the matter? Scared?

298
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
Let's go, big bunny!

299
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
One, two, three. Go!

300
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
I'm gonna kill myself!

301
00:17:29 --> 00:17:29
