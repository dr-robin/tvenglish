1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
- Hey.- Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
Look, can we talkabout what happened here last night?

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
Sure. Just give me a secondto get all huffy and weird like you.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:15
You believe that whoever did somethinglast night did what they did or didn't do?

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
Okay, you really don't knowwhat I'm talking about?

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
- No.- Okay. Last night, after the party...

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
...I saw Rachel kissing that jerkfrom her office out on your balcony.

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
Our balcony? Seriously?

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
That's so funny. I told Monicawe should put lights on our balcony...

10
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
...and she said, "No, no. It's too cold.Nobody will go out there. " And I said:

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
"Maybe if we put some lightsout there they will."

12
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
Right, that's what I came over to talkabout. I saw Rachel kissing some guy...

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
...on your balcony,even though there were no lights!

14
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
So are you gonna talk to her?

15
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
Why? Why should I? I mean,if she wants to move on, that's fine.

16
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
You know when "that's fine" soundstrue? When someone yells it and spits.

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
No, I'm serious. I mean, if she wantsto date people, fine. I don't care.

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
But at least she could have told me.

19
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
You know, I've been putting my life onhold and concentrating on Emma.

20
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
But if she wants to go out there kissingguys she barely knows, then so will I.

21
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
Very funny! Ross is gay!

22
00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
No, no.Good, so you're moving on.

23
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
Do you have any ideawhere you're moving on to?

24
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
I've got plenty of opportunities.

25
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
Just now, there was some womanat the coffeehouse smiled at me.

26
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
And then the other day on the subway,a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.

27
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
Dude, don't rub my facein your crazy single life.

28
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
And there's an anthropologistat school...

29
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
...who totally came on to me duringthe interdepartmental potluck dinner.

30
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
Why did I get married?

31
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37

34
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
Hey, let me ask you guys something.

35
00:02:17 --> 00:02:18
I'm having new headshotstaken tomorrow.

36
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
The photographer said she thinksI should have my eyebrows waxed.

37
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Is that weird for a guy?

38
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
- Well, it depends.- On?

39
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
On how far along he isin the sex-change process.

40
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
No, I totally disagree. I think it's finefor a guy to do something like that.

41
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
Especially an actor.

42
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
I mean, not that you need to.Your eyebrows are...

43
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,you're freaking me out.

44
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.

45
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
Oh, man, now I have to getthose done too?

46
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
- Wow, talk about high maintenance.- You dye your hair.

47
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
- I'm a woman.- Double standards!

48
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
Before I forget, are you comingto Mike's piano bar tonight?

49
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
- Only if I don't have to get up and sing.- But everybody sings. It's so fun.

50
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
Last time, this adorable old man got upthere, forgot all the words, flipped out...

51
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
...and everyone booed him off the stage.It was so funny.

52
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
Look, I'm not good at singing.

53
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
Oh, what's the matter? You scared?You afraid I'm a better singer?

54
00:03:13 --> 00:03:14
You afraid I'm gonna beat youat singing?

55
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.

56
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
Wow, I must be growing up.

57
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
Okay, fine. Just please come andsupport Mike. You don't have to sing.

58
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
So I don't have to sing, and I can just sitthere and pass judgment on others?

59
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
- While drinking.- I'm there.

60
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
Hi, you guys.Listen, I really need your help.

61
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
I think I did somethingreally stupid.

62
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
Well, yes, Rachel, but you got somethingso beautiful out of it.

63
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
No, not that.I kissed Gavin last night.

64
00:03:46 --> 00:03:46
- My God.- You kissed him?

65
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
Yeah, it was after the party,we were on the balcony...

66
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
Wait, wait, wait. I was at homethe whole time. How did I miss that?

67
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
Well, it was the end of the party. Youwere probably ironing wrapping paper.

68
00:03:56 --> 00:03:57
Oh, yeah.

69
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
So how did you end up kissing?

70
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
We were all aloneand he was being really nice...

71
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
...and he gave me this scarf.- I thought you hated him.

72
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
Well, there is a thin linebetween love and hate...

73
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
...and it turns out that lineis a scarf.

74
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
Are you thinking of startingsomething up with this guy?

75
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
I don't know. It's so complicated.I work with this guy.

76
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
I have the baby, and I have Ross.I don't know what to do.

77
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
And I have to be at the officeand see Gavin in 10 minutes.

78
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
Sounds like you need to thinkabout what you want and talk to Gavin.

79
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
- And you definitely should talk to Ross.- Or...

80
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
...I could call in sickand not deal with it at all.

81
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
Wow! Five months maternity leave,you're back for four days...

82
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
...kiss a co-worker and call in sick.They are lucky to have you.

83
00:04:46 --> 00:04:46
- Hi.- Hi.

84
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
- I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.- Name?

85
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
Chandler Bing.

86
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
Okay, very good.

87
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,and Sonya will be right with you.

88
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
Okay. Thanks.

89
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
I touched the stuff.

90
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
I'll take care of it.

91
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
Thanks.

92
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
So do you...?Do you get a lot of guys in here?

93
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
- Oh, absolutely.- Oh, good.

94
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
- You looking to meet somebody?- All right, let's just do this.

95
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.

96
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
First, I want to tweezesome of the strays, okay?

97
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
- Now, this may sting just a little bit.- I have an extremely high threshold...

98
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
Holy Mother of God!Oh, my face! My face!

99
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

100
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
It's just a bit of shock, that's all.

101
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
- But I'll be fine. You can go again.- Okay.

102
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
Sorry.

103
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
Damn it, woman!

104
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
It's the most eligible man in New York.How's the moving on going?

105
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
Not well. I went on the subway againand someone did sit on my hand...

106
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
...but that person was neither femalenor wearing pants.

107
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
Maybe you're going about thisthe wrong way. I mean, think about it:

108
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children.

109
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
The personal ad writes itself.

110
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
You know, that's funny. Yeah.So do you think you'll ever work again?

111
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
What are you doing?You know I can only dish it out.

112
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
I can't believe Rachel just moved onand didn't say anything to me.

113
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
Maybe she didn't move on.

114
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,one-time birthday thing.

115
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
No, a month ago, she gave her numberto some guy in a bar.

116
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
- Did she go out with him?- No. When he called...

117
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
...I threw the message away.

118
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
The highroad.

119
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
All right, you know what? Enough.Enough talking. I have to get moving.

120
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
Hey, check out those two blondsover there. Hey, come with me.

121
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
Are you trying to geteverybody divorced?

122
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
You don't have to do anything.It'll just be easier if it's two of us.

123
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
Like college, remember? First, youbreak the ice with some kind of a joke...

124
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
...so they know you're the funny one. Iswoop in with interesting conversation...

125
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
...so they'll see that I'm the brilliant,brooding sexy one.

126
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
I thought I got to make the jokes.

127
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
- Don't you have to be at work?- Oh, come on.

128
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.This is my friend Ross right here.

129
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
We were wondering...

130
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
...if you're up for it, we only needsix more people for a human pyramid.

131
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
Swoop. Swoop.

132
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
Hey, I noticeyou're reading the paper.

133
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
Another flood in Europe, huh?

134
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
Here's a question:

135
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
Would you rather drownor be burned alive?

136
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
- I'm sorry, we're just leaving.- Okay.

137
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
We still got it.

138
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
- Who is it?- Gavin. I brought you some soup.

139
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
- Why?- I heard your were sick.

140
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
Oh, right! Hold on,let me just clean up in here a little bit.

141
00:09:04 --> 00:09:05
Hello, Gavin.

142
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
I missed you at work.How you feeling?

143
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.

144
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
Oh, good. Because I was havinga totally paranoid moment...

145
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
...where I thought youcalled in sick to avoid me.

146
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
Oh, no, no, no.

147
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
So I had fun last night.

148
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
So did I.

149
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
Exactly how contagiousis this thing you have?

150
00:09:28 --> 00:09:32
Is it a cold from standing onthe balcony, or did a monkey bite you?

151
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
- It's just a cold.- Do you have a fever?

152
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
Let me see.

153
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
What? What is it?What's the matter?

154
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
What's Ross doing to youin that picture?

155
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.

156
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
He thought it would be funny.

157
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
- Right. Right.- Yeah.

158
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
- Ross.- Yeah.

159
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
What's the deal with you guys? I don'twanna get in the middle of anything.

160
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
You're not getting in the middleof anything. Don't worry about Ross.

161
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
Hide! That's Ross! Hide!

162
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
- Hide! Hide!- Yeah, but you said not to worry...

163
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
I lied and I'm not sick either!Just stay behind the curtain!

164
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
- Hi.- Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.

165
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
No. I'm here to take Emmato your mother's, remember?

166
00:10:17 --> 00:10:18
Right. Yes, yes.

167
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
- Don't panic.- What?

168
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
There is a man behind your curtain.

169
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
- I have Mace in my purse.- No, that's okay! No, no, no.

170
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
This is my business associate Gavinbeing silly. Come out from behind there.

171
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.

172
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
It was my idea to stand there.

173
00:10:36 --> 00:10:40
- Hello. I'll just go get Emma.- Okay.

174
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
So...

175
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
...why did I have to hide?- I thought it was Ross.

176
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
I thought there was nothinggoing on between you.

177
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
There isn't. There totally isn't.

178
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
You hear keys in the hall and you jumplike a bronco coming out of the chute.

179
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
I used to be a rodeo clown.

180
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
All right, look, Gavin...

181
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
...I guess I felt guiltythat you were here...

182
00:11:08 --> 00:11:09
...which I shouldn't.

183
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
You know, Ross and Iare not in a relationship...

184
00:11:12 --> 00:11:16
...but he is the father of my child.And, you know...

185
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
...we do live together. And plus,there's just so much history, you know?

186
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
It's just...I don't know.

187
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
- I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.- It's okay.

188
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
It's probably not my place,but can I give you a piece of advice?

189
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
- Yes.- You should talk to Ross about all this.

190
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
People keep saying that.

191
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
I'm sorry, Gavin.

192
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Don't be.

193
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
It's just bad timing.

194
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
So seriously, rodeo clown?

195
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
One of the best, ma'am.One of the best.

196
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
Oh, she's my girlfriend.That's not just how we do it here.

197
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
I'm gonna take a little break,and when we come back...

198
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
...we've got Kenneth singing"I Touch Myself."

199
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
I'm not here to judge.

200
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
- You have got to sing.- No, I told you I can't.

201
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
But you would have so much fun.And you have a really nice voice.

202
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
- When have you heard me sing?- All the time, when you're cooking.

203
00:12:31 --> 00:12:32
- What?- Yeah, you're always singing:

204
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
I've got love in my tummy

205
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Yeah, I do rock that one.

206
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
Isn't there just a little part of youthat wants to get up there?

207
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.

208
00:12:45 --> 00:12:46
I don't even know what I would sing.

209
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
- Well, I've got a book around...- "Delta Dawn."

210
00:12:55 --> 00:13:00
Hi. I couldn't help but notice,but that's an unusual necklace.

211
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
You already hit on me an hour ago.

212
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
Right. So that's a firm no?

213
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
I don't believe this.I just keep striking out.

214
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
I don't get it either.

215
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
I mean, you're obviously desperate.

216
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
You're asking womenhow they wanna be killed.

217
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
This is great.Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys...

218
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
...until she finds the one she wants,and I'm gonna die alone.

219
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
By drowning or...?

220
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
- Why would he break up with me?- I don't know, sweetie.

221
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
All I ever wanted was to just love himand have him love me back.

222
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
I mean, am I so unlovable?

223
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
- Wow.- I know.

224
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
All right. That was Kenneth with his...

225
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
...much too literal renditionof "I Touch Myself."

226
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
Coming up next, we've got Monicasinging "Delta Dawn."

227
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
Wait. I can't sing infront of all these people.

228
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
Just pretend they're noteven here. It's okay.

229
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
Once that spotlight hits you, it's sobright, you won't see anyone anyway.

230
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
Hi, I'm Monica. And I'm goingto be singing "Delta Dawn."

231
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
- Can you totally see through her shirt?- Like an x-ray.

232
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
Bad day not to wear a bra.

233
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
I need your help.

234
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
Wow, it seems serious.

235
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
What seems to be the problem,Ashley Judd?

236
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
I'm getting new headshots taken.So I went to get my eyebrows shaped.

237
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
I'm sorry.Moment to make fun of that, please.

238
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
I may be a sissy, but I'll stillpound you into the ground.

239
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
Look, it hurt so bad, I could onlylet her do one eyebrow, and now...

240
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
...they don't match!

241
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
It's like a baby caterpillarchasing its mama.

242
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
You got to help me out, okay?Look, I have a magic marker.

243
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
Fill in the skinny oneso I don't look stupid for my pictures.

244
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
Okay, first of all, this is green.

245
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
- What the hell am I supposed to do?!- I will help you out...

246
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
...but you have to promise you won'ttell anyone what I'm about to tell you.

247
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
What? What?

248
00:15:43 --> 00:15:44
Okay.

249
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
You know how most kids get theirallowance from mowing the lawn...

250
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
...or taking out the garbage?Well, I earned mine...

251
00:15:51 --> 00:15:56
...by plucking the eyebrows of my fatherand his "business partners."

252
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
Oh, my God.

253
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
Yeah, well, I guess you don't needmy help, "Victor% Victoria."

254
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
No, no, no. I do. I do.I need your help.

255
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
But, Chandler, I don't know if I can takeany more plucking. It hurt so bad.

256
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
Not with my combination of ice cubes,aloe vera and my gentle...

257
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
...self-loathing touch.

258
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
I'm sorry, the song's over.

259
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
- Did you see me up there?- Every little bit of you.

260
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
I can't believe I sangin front of people and they liked me.

261
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
Did you hear that guy shouting,"Look at those tips"?

262
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
I mean, did I really helpyou get a lot of tips?

263
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
Sure.

264
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
- Mon, not that you didn't sound good...- Good?

265
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
Didn't you hear them? I was great!

266
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
Thank you so much for making medo this. That is the best gift ever.

267
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
Also a good gift: Underwear.

268
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
Thank you so muchfor letting me do this.

269
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
Public bathrooms freak me out. I can'teven pee, let alone do anything else.

270
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
But what's great is, you don'tmind talking about it.

271
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
It is so amazing that I met you on thesame day that Eric broke up with me...

272
00:17:15 --> 00:17:18
...because it's like, you lose a boyfriend,and you get a boyfriend.

273
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
No, don't worry. This is not somerebound thing. I am totally over Eric.

274
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
Good choice, Ross.

275
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
Hey. Hi. There you are.

276
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
- I've been looking for you everywhere.- Hello. Well, here I am.

277
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
My mom is not bringingthe baby back until 9:00.

278
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
So I was hoping you and Icould have a chance to kind of...

279
00:17:46 --> 00:17:48
- Somebody here?- Oh, yeah. That's Michelle.

280
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
- Who?- Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.

281
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
- You've been seeing someone?- Yeah, didn't I mention that?

282
00:17:55 --> 00:17:57
I mean, we haven't beengoing out too long...

283
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
...but there's this amazingconnection between us.

284
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
I mean, in fact just before you came in,she called me her boyfriend.

285
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
I thought it was a little too soon,but also, it felt kind of nice.

286
00:18:09 --> 00:18:12
What are you taking amoxicillin for?

287
00:18:16 --> 00:18:19
How great is this?You're already comfortable enough...

288
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
...to look through my stuff.

289
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23
I'm sorry, Michelle,this is my roommate, Rachel.

290
00:18:23 --> 00:18:25
And I'm also Emma's mother.

291
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
- Who's Emma?- I told you about my daughter.

292
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
This is your daughter?

293
00:18:31 --> 00:18:33
I could be your new mommy.

294
00:18:41 --> 00:18:42
And done.

295
00:18:43 --> 00:18:45
Oh, my God.

296
00:18:45 --> 00:18:47
I didn't feel a thing.Hey, are you still looking for a job?

297
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
Because you could tweeze circlesaround that sadistic bitch at the salon.

298
00:18:51 --> 00:18:54
- Thanks. Wanna see what it looks like?- Yeah.

299
00:18:55 --> 00:18:58
They totally match.They look great.

300
00:18:58 --> 00:19:01
They look great. How you doing?

301
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
Yeah, I think it looks pretty good.I was a little worried I was...

302
00:19:04 --> 00:19:06
...uncovering a birthmarkright about there...

303
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
...but it turned out to bea little piece of chocolate.

304
00:19:09 --> 00:19:11
- Chandler, thank you so much.- No problem.

305
00:19:11 --> 00:19:14
Listen, that was a prettygirlie hour we just spent.

306
00:19:14 --> 00:19:16
We should do something manlyto make up for it.

307
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
Yeah.

308
00:19:21 --> 00:19:23
- Curl my eyelashes.- Yeah!

309
00:19:25 --> 00:19:29
For my next song, I think I'll singsomething a little more upbeat, all right?

310
00:19:29 --> 00:19:32
How about the Pointer Sisters'"I'm So Excited"?

311
00:19:33 --> 00:19:34
And make it bouncy.

312
00:19:35 --> 00:19:37
Well, you can probably take care of thaton your end.

313
00:19:38 --> 00:19:41
I'm sorry I'm late. You'll understandwhen you see Joey.

314
00:19:41 --> 00:19:44
Honey, you're just in time.I'm about to sing another song.

315
00:19:44 --> 00:19:46
- Really? In front of all these people?- And they love me.

316
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
- Oh, my God.- She gives the people what they want.

317
00:19:50 --> 00:19:52
All right, watch.

318
00:20:05 --> 00:20:08
Are those my wife's nipples?

319
00:20:08 --> 00:20:11
Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before.I wouldn't have let her go up again.

320
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
I've got to stop this.

321
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
Who cares? They still love me.

322
00:20:29 --> 00:20:32
You, touching yourself! Out!

323
00:20:37 --> 00:20:38
Wow! She does that a lot.

324
00:20:40 --> 00:20:42
Ross, you didn't tell meyou were a doctor.

325
00:20:43 --> 00:20:45
Wait a minute. You haven't eventold her you are a doctor yet?

326
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
How long have you known her,like an hour?

327
00:20:47 --> 00:20:49
Actually, about an hour and a half.

328
00:20:50 --> 00:20:53
I told you it wasn't long, but there'san amazing connection between us.

329
00:20:53 --> 00:20:55
You feel that too?

330
00:20:55 --> 00:20:59
- I thought that that was just me.- Are you kidding?

331
00:20:59 --> 00:21:02
- Do you wanna go away this weekend?- We'll see.

332
00:21:03 --> 00:21:05
Ross, what's going on here?

333
00:21:05 --> 00:21:07
Are we just bringing strange womenback to the apartment now?

334
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
I don't know. Are we just kissingguys on balconies?

335
00:21:10 --> 00:21:13
- How do you know about that?- Through the magic of sight.

336
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
- I was here, putting our child to sleep...- Emma.

337
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
When I looked through the windowand saw you kissing a guy...

338
00:21:23 --> 00:21:24
...you've known for what, a week?

339
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
God, is that what this is all about?You bring her up here to get back at me?

340
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
No, actually, see, I had to peebecause I can't use public bathrooms...

341
00:21:31 --> 00:21:34
...because of the doody parasites.- Okay, Michelle, it's time to go.

342
00:21:34 --> 00:21:36
- Well, call me.- Okay.

343
00:21:37 --> 00:21:38
Wait, you don't havemy phone number.

344
00:21:38 --> 00:21:41
You know what?If it's meant to be, I'll guess it.

345
00:21:42 --> 00:21:44
Bye-bye.

346
00:21:44 --> 00:21:46
Score.

347
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
Did you not like her? Because I washoping we could come...

348
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
...to your kissing partieson the balcony.

349
00:21:50 --> 00:21:53
I can't believe you are making a big dealabout this. It was one kiss!

350
00:21:53 --> 00:21:55
- One guy. One time!- Oh, really?

351
00:21:55 --> 00:21:57
- Yeah.- Oh, really?

352
00:21:59 --> 00:22:00
Oh, yeah.

353
00:22:00 --> 00:22:03
- What about the guy from the bar?- Who?

354
00:22:03 --> 00:22:05
The guy you gave your number to.

355
00:22:05 --> 00:22:09
- How do you know about that?- Because he called here looking for you.

356
00:22:09 --> 00:22:12
So don't tell me kissing this guyfrom work is a one-time thing.

357
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
Because you've been out therein bars and on balconies...

358
00:22:15 --> 00:22:19
...for over a month now. And youdon't even have the courtesy to tell me.

359
00:22:19 --> 00:22:22
- Why didn't I get that message?- What?

360
00:22:22 --> 00:22:25
From the guy in the bar?Why didn't I get that message?

361
00:22:25 --> 00:22:27
Because I folded it upand put it in my pants pocket.

362
00:22:28 --> 00:22:30
Do you not look there?

363
00:22:32 --> 00:22:33
Ross.

364
00:22:35 --> 00:22:37
I never gave it to you.

365
00:22:37 --> 00:22:39
Why?

366
00:22:40 --> 00:22:42
- I don't know.- Oh, God, you know what? I don't...

367
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44
Who do you think you are?Who are you to decide...

368
00:22:44 --> 00:22:47
...what messagesI should or should not get?!

369
00:22:47 --> 00:22:49
Who am I? I'm the guywho's taking care of our baby...

370
00:22:49 --> 00:22:52
...while you're at bars meeting guys!- I cannot believe you.

371
00:22:52 --> 00:22:56
I actually came in here hoping to havea mature conversation about us.

372
00:22:56 --> 00:22:58
But I can't do that with someonewho hides my messages...

373
00:22:58 --> 00:23:00
...and brings crazy womenback to my apartment!

374
00:23:00 --> 00:23:04
Hey, none of the sane oneswanted to come back with me!

375
00:23:06 --> 00:23:08
That's not the point, okay?The point is...

376
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
...you are the one who moved onand didn't tell anyone.

377
00:23:12 --> 00:23:15
Oh, God, Ross,this is just so messed up.

378
00:23:15 --> 00:23:19
What is wrong with us? When peoplehear about our situation, they ask:

379
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
"You live together, but you're nota couple, yet you have a baby?

380
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
Isn't that weird?" And I say,"No. It's not, because it works for us."

381
00:23:25 --> 00:23:26
But you know what?This doesn't work.

382
00:23:26 --> 00:23:30
- In fact, this is the opposite of working.- Clearly.

383
00:23:31 --> 00:23:33
And you know...

384
00:23:33 --> 00:23:36
...we said that we would live togetheras long as this makes sense...

385
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
...and maybe thisjust doesn't make sense anymore.

386
00:23:41 --> 00:23:43
Yeah, maybe not.

387
00:23:44 --> 00:23:45
So, what do you wanna do?

388
00:23:49 --> 00:23:50
Hi.

389
00:23:50 --> 00:23:53
Can Emma and I live here for a while?

390
00:23:53 --> 00:23:55
God.

391
00:23:56 --> 00:23:59
- Of course.- Thank you.

392
00:24:02 --> 00:24:05
Your eyebrows look weird.

393
00:24:25 --> 00:24:27
So you'll just touch yourselffor anything, then?

394
00:24:31 --> 00:24:32
