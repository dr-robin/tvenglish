16

00:00:03.69,00:00:07.52

17

So your first sexual experience[br]was with a woman?

18



19

00:00:08.33,00:00:10.84

20

I was 1 5.[br]It was my best friend, Ruth.

21



22

00:00:11.05,00:00:13.36

23

And we got drunk on that hard cider.

24



25

00:00:13.61,00:00:16.25

26

And then suddenly,[br]we were making out.

27



28

00:00:17.41,00:00:18.24

29

Tell it again.

30



31

00:00:21.81,00:00:22.60

32

Seriously.

33



34

00:00:25.61,00:00:28.07

35

Can that woman talk[br]about anything else but sex?

36



37

00:00:29.49,00:00:33.24

38

Yeah, sure. Earlier she was[br]talking about geography.

39



40

00:00:34.13,00:00:37.44

41

She was listing the countries[br]she's done it in.

42



43

00:00:39.25,00:00:41.08

44

I think we all[br]learned something.

45



46

00:00:42.65,00:00:44.76

47

Hey, you guys! Look what I found!

48



49

00:00:45.01,00:00:46.88

50

That's my mom's writing. Look.

51



52

00:00:47.33,00:00:50.84

53

"Me and Frank and Phoebe,[br]graduation, 1 965. "

54



55

00:00:51.05,00:00:54.32

56

-Do you know what that means?[br]-That you're actually 50?

57



58

00:00:55.05,00:00:57.69

59

That's not "me" Phoebe.[br]That's her pal, Phoebe.

60



61

00:00:57.93,00:01:00.20

62

According to her yearbook,[br]they were BFF.

63



64

00:01:01.81,00:01:03.00

65

Best Friends Forever.

66



67

00:01:03.93,00:01:04.96

68

That's great!

69



70

00:01:05.21,00:01:09.20

71

I know! She probably has all kinds[br]of stories about my parents.

72



73

00:01:09.41,00:01:11.08

74

She might know where my dad is.

75



76

00:01:11.29,00:01:13.28

77

I looked her up.[br]She lives by the beach.

78



79

00:01:13.53,00:01:15.56

80

Maybe this weekend we can[br]go there.

81



82

00:01:16.81,00:01:19.76

83

-Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.[br]-That's too bad.

84



85

00:01:20.45,00:01:22.00

86

Big fat bummer.

87



88

00:01:23.53,00:01:25.84

89

So tomorrow we'll drive out[br]to Montauk.

90



91

00:01:26.05,00:01:27.92

92

Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

93

100

00:02:20.61,00:02:22.04

101

Would you look at them?

102



103

00:02:23.13,00:02:25.16

104

I'm never gonna find[br]a boyfriend again.

105



106

00:02:25.41,00:02:27.64

107

I'm gonna die an old maid.

108



109

00:02:27.89,00:02:30.04

110

You're not gonna die an old maid.

111



112

00:02:30.25,00:02:32.71

113

Maybe an old spinster cook.

114



115

00:02:35.61,00:02:38.28

116

-Thanks.[br]-Besides, worse comes to worse. . .

117



118

00:02:38.49,00:02:40.24

119

. . .I'll be your boyfriend.

120



121

00:02:43.45,00:02:44.44

122

Yeah, right.

123



124

00:02:47.61,00:02:49.32

125

Why is that so funny?

126



127

00:02:49.57,00:02:51.48

128

You made a joke, right?

129



130

00:02:51.73,00:02:53.21

131

So I laughed.

132



133

00:02:55.73,00:02:57.16

134

A little too hard.

135



136

00:02:58.53,00:03:00.28

137

Am I not boyfriend material?

138



139

00:03:02.09,00:03:03.00

140

You're Chandler.

141



142

00:03:05.01,00:03:07.24

143

You know. Chandler!

144



145

00:03:07.69,00:03:10.60

146

Okay, so we've established[br]my name, and hit me.

147



148

00:03:11.49,00:03:14.08

149

But say we weren't friends.[br]Say it's a blind date.

150



151

00:03:14.33,00:03:18.68

152

I show up at your door and I'm,[br]like, "Hey, nice to meet you. "

153



154

00:03:20.21,00:03:24.04

155

I'd probably be scared of a guy[br]using a fake voice.

156



157

00:03:25.33,00:03:26.92

158

Oh, good. You bought food.

159



160

00:03:27.17,00:03:29.04

161

No, just my luggage.

162



163

00:03:36.13,00:03:38.36

164

I am having the best karma this week.

165



166

00:03:38.57,00:03:40.48

167

I find this woman[br]who knew my parents. . .

168



169

00:03:40.73,00:03:43.64

170

. . .and then my client[br]gives me his beach house.

171



172

00:03:43.85,00:03:46.49

173

What about that bike[br]messenger you hit?

174



175

00:03:46.73,00:03:49.00

176

Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

177



178

00:03:51.01,00:03:52.84

179

Hey, check out the hat!

180



181

00:03:56.09,00:03:57.92

182

Wait a minute, I know that hat.

183



184

00:03:58.61,00:04:00.09

185

I was taken aboard that hat.

186



187

00:04:01.65,00:04:03.52

188

They did experiments on me.

189



190

00:04:03.73,00:04:05.05

191

I can't have children!

192



193

00:04:06.41,00:04:08.44

194

Seriously, where did you get the hat?

195



196

00:04:08.69,00:04:09.84

197

Ross gave it to me.

198



199

00:04:10.09,00:04:12.16

200

I think she looks good.

201



202

00:04:13.25,00:04:14.76

203

Did he buy it for you. . .

204



205

00:04:15.25,00:04:16.52

206

. . .or win it for you?

207



208

00:04:18.01,00:04:20.28

209

Excuse me,[br]my fashion-impaired friends. . .

210



211

00:04:20.53,00:04:22.44

212

. . .I'm here to tell you[br]hats are back.

213



214

00:04:22.69,00:04:26.24

215

And this time, they've ganged up[br]and formed one giant super-hat.

216



217

00:04:32.37,00:04:33.16

218

Go, go, go!

219



220

00:04:33.37,00:04:35.48

221

Now everybody wants to be[br]under the hat!

222



223

00:04:42.93,00:04:44.48

224

What's with all this sand?

225



226

00:04:44.73,00:04:47.16

227

Bob said there might be flood damage.

228



229

00:04:47.41,00:04:49.52

230

Either that or he has[br]a really big cat.

231



232

00:04:54.37,00:04:56.16

233

It's kind of an unusual house.

234



235

00:04:56.41,00:05:00.04

236

It has three beautiful bedrooms[br]and no baths.

237



238

00:05:00.37,00:05:03.24

239

But, you know, the ocean[br]is right there.

240



241

00:05:04.01,00:05:05.04

242

Knock, knock, knock.

243



244

00:05:05.53,00:05:07.36

245

Hang on.[br]Come in, come in.

246



247

00:05:07.61,00:05:09.52

248

Think about it and call me back.

249



250

00:05:11.29,00:05:12.48

251

Are you Phoebe Abbott?

252



253

00:05:13.61,00:05:16.80

254

Surprise, Phoebe Abbott![br]I'm your best friend's daughter!

255



256

00:05:19.13,00:05:20.35

257

You're lrwin's daughter?

258



259

00:05:20.61,00:05:23.28

260

I mean your old best friend.[br]Here.

261



262

00:05:24.01,00:05:27.84

263

-Lily? From high school? Remember?[br]-Oh, God, Lily. Yes.

264



265

00:05:28.05,00:05:30.00

266

Of course I remember Lily.

267



268

00:05:31.89,00:05:32.72

269

Then you must be--

270



271

00:05:32.97,00:05:34.29

272

Phoebe, Phoebe.

273



274

00:05:35.93,00:05:38.12

275

She named me after you, I guess.

276



277

00:05:38.53,00:05:41.09

278

Wow. Well.[br]Look, there's Frank!

279



280

00:05:41.29,00:05:42.88

281

Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!

282



283

00:05:43.13,00:05:45.24

284

That's my dad. That's Frank!

285



286

00:05:45.45,00:05:47.84

287

I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

288



289

00:05:48.45,00:05:50.68

290

Take it easy.[br]If you want, there's cookies.

291



292

00:05:50.93,00:05:53.65

293

Or sangria! I could make sangria!

294



295

00:05:53.89,00:05:55.80

296

Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

297



298

00:05:58.53,00:06:02.00

299

Anyway, I've been[br]looking for my father.

300



301

00:06:03.01,00:06:06.44

302

-Have you heard from him or seen him?[br]-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

303



304

00:06:06.65,00:06:09.84

305

I lost track of everybody[br]after high school.

306



307

00:06:12.41,00:06:16.04

308

Well, so tell me everything[br]about my parents. Everything.

309



310

00:06:16.25,00:06:19.28

311

Oh, well, you know,[br]we were always together.

312



313

00:06:19.53,00:06:22.84

314

-The other kids had a nickname for us.[br]-What was it?

315



316

00:06:23.05,00:06:24.48

317

The Three Losers.

318



319

00:06:25.33,00:06:26.65

320

Oh, poor Lily.

321



322

00:06:28.65,00:06:32.64

323

I heard what happened. That must[br]have been just terrible for you. . .

324



325

00:06:32.89,00:06:34.68

326

. . .Iosing your mother that way.

327



328

00:06:35.85,00:06:37.48

329

Yeah, no, it was great.

330



331

00:06:48.61,00:06:51.12

332

You know what a really good[br]rainy-day game is?

333



334

00:06:51.37,00:06:53.04

335

I mean, naked game.

336



337

00:06:54.05,00:06:55.84

338

We should play strip poker.

339



340

00:06:56.29,00:06:57.24

341

Are you crazy?

342



343

00:06:57.49,00:07:01.20

344

Come on. When you go away,[br]you have to play. It's, like, a law.

345



346

00:07:02.61,00:07:04.16

347

-All done.[br]-Thank you.

348



349

00:07:04.41,00:07:06.12

350

Okay. Who's next?

351



352

00:07:10.73,00:07:11.95

353

No way!

354



355

00:07:12.17,00:07:16.16

356

Come on, please. I'm bored.[br]You let me do it once before.

357



358

00:07:20.33,00:07:23.44

359

Well, if that's the rule[br]this weekend. . . .

360



361

00:07:25.33,00:07:28.12

362

-Get away.[br]-Take it like a man. Come on!

363



364

00:07:30.01,00:07:31.00

365

Big bullies!

366



367

00:07:44.49,00:07:45.64

368

How are we doing?

369



370

00:07:45.89,00:07:47.44

371

Bored and bored.

372



373

00:07:48.93,00:07:51.88

374

You know what naked card game's[br]never boring?

375



376

00:07:54.25,00:07:55.84

377

So what's Phoebe like?

378



379

00:07:56.13,00:07:59.24

380

I'm kind, caring and sweet.[br]What's Monica like?

381



382

00:08:00.73,00:08:03.08

383

No, the other Phoebe.[br]The one you went to see?

384



385

00:08:03.33,00:08:05.89

386

I think she knows where my dad is!

387



388

00:08:06.09,00:08:06.96

389

Cool!

390



391

00:08:07.21,00:08:08.00

392

Where is he?

393



394

00:08:08.21,00:08:11.04

395

She was pretending she hasn't[br]heard from him. . .

396



397

00:08:11.29,00:08:13.28

398

. . .but I found this picture.

399



400

00:08:13.53,00:08:15.84

401

Isn't this what he would[br]look like now?

402



403

00:08:16.61,00:08:17.44

404

Totally familiar.

405



406

00:08:20.97,00:08:22.08

407

Why would she lie to you?

408



409

00:08:22.33,00:08:25.44

410

We're having dinner tomorrow.[br]Maybe she'll tell me then.

411



412

00:08:25.65,00:08:27.88

413

Maybe she just wanted[br]to give him time. . .

414



415

00:08:28.13,00:08:30.04

416

. . .to buy me presents.[br]I don't know.

417



418

00:08:31.37,00:08:33.04

419

So you're all bored?

420



421

00:08:34.09,00:08:37.36

422

I'll close my eyes and point[br]to someone. Whoever it is. . .

423



424

00:08:37.61,00:08:40.84

425

. . .has to think of something[br]fun to do. And we have to do it.

426



427

00:08:41.09,00:08:42.80

428

Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

429



430

00:08:46.49,00:08:48.52

431

You know, we could just do this!

432



433

00:08:52.65,00:08:54.72

434

We all have to play strip poker?

435



436

00:08:58.09,00:08:59.44

437

Strip Happy Days Game?

438



439

00:09:00.45,00:09:05.36

440

I couldn't find cards, so it was this[br]or Strip Bag-Of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

441



442

00:09:06.33,00:09:07.36

443

Done.

444



445

00:09:09.41,00:09:14.04

446

"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.[br]Collect two cool points. "

447



448

00:09:15.33,00:09:18.72

449

Get five points, you get to make[br]someone take off one item of clothing.

450



451

00:09:18.97,00:09:21.43

452

It hasn't happened yet,[br]but we're very excited.

453



454

00:09:22.53,00:09:23.72

455

Okay, come on.

456



457

00:09:24.25,00:09:29.16

458

Daddy needs a new electromagnetic[br]microscope for Prehistoric Forensics.

459



460

00:09:34.41,00:09:38.52

461

"Take Pinky Tuscadero up[br]to lnspiration Point.

462



463

00:09:38.77,00:09:40.84

464

Collect three cool points. " Yeah!

465



466

00:09:41.05,00:09:42.68

467

Which gives me five.

468



469

00:09:42.93,00:09:45.57

470

And let's see, who is gonna lose[br]their clothes?

471



472

00:09:46.69,00:09:50.00

473

I think I pick our strip poker[br]sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

474



475

00:09:53.57,00:09:55.68

476

All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

477



478

00:09:58.29,00:10:02.44

479

"Your band is playing at Arnold's.[br]Collect three cool points. "

480



481

00:10:02.69,00:10:07.44

482

Which means I have five and[br]that means I get Joey's boxers.

483



484

00:10:13.53,00:10:15.04

485

Fine. Gang up on me.

486



487

00:10:15.29,00:10:17.93

488

I got you all,[br]right where I want you.

489



490

00:10:18.41,00:10:20.08

491

Come on! Take them off!

492



493

00:10:20.33,00:10:21.84

494

Actually, it's kind of cold.

495



496

00:10:22.05,00:10:25.40

497

What if I keep them on and[br]give you a peek at the good stuff?

498



499

00:10:25.89,00:10:27.88

500

I'm gonna make more margaritas.

501



502

00:10:28.13,00:10:30.96

503

What are you doing?[br]Trying to get me drunk?

504



505

00:10:31.25,00:10:33.40

506

I'm just making margaritas.

507



508

00:10:34.69,00:10:36.20

509

Think I'll help her out.

510



511

00:10:39.89,00:10:41.11

512

What is going on here?

513



514

00:10:41.33,00:10:42.24

515

What?

516



517

00:10:42.49,00:10:45.84

518

You're painting his toenails.[br]Chasing him around the room.

519



520

00:10:46.05,00:10:47.04

521

Monica, please.

522



523

00:10:47.29,00:10:49.24

524

He's totally flirting with you too.

525



526

00:10:50.33,00:10:51.55

527

He is, isn't he?

528



529

00:10:53.13,00:10:57.09

530

I don't know. Maybe it's just[br]being here at the beach together. . .

531



532

00:10:57.33,00:10:58.73

533

. . .but it's like something--

534



535

00:11:04.21,00:11:05.00

536

Hi, Bonnie.

537



538

00:11:06.21,00:11:08.85

539

My boss let me off early,[br]so I took the train.

540



541

00:11:09.05,00:11:10.32

542

What are you guys doing?

543



544

00:11:10.57,00:11:12.96

545

We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

546



547

00:11:14.01,00:11:15.52

548

Cool! I'll catch up!

549



550

00:11:24.65,00:11:27.32

551

So you still don't think. . .

552



553

00:11:27.61,00:11:29.24

554

. . .I'm boyfriend material?

555



556

00:11:31.29,00:11:34.28

557

I saw you checking me out[br]during the game last night.

558



559

00:11:34.73,00:11:36.64

560

You didn't even take off your pants.

561



562

00:11:36.89,00:11:37.72

563

Lucky for you.

564



565

00:11:39.65,00:11:41.20

566

-What?[br]-I don't know.

567



568

00:11:42.81,00:11:46.72

569

Well, is everybody else having[br]just the best time?

570



571

00:11:48.01,00:11:49.16

572

Joey's asleep.

573



574

00:11:58.73,00:12:01.84

575

He passed out. We put sand[br]around him to keep him warm.

576



577

00:12:04.73,00:12:08.08

578

Well, I assume the happy couple[br]isn't up yet?

579



580

00:12:08.33,00:12:10.52

581

Did you guys hear them last night?

582



583

00:12:10.81,00:12:14.96

584

I don't know what they were doing,[br]but sea turtles came up to the house.

585



586

00:12:17.33,00:12:18.44

587

Good morning.

588



589

00:12:19.33,00:12:20.65

590

-How'd you sleep?[br]-Great.

591



592

00:12:20.89,00:12:21.68

593

Like a log.

594



595

00:12:21.93,00:12:23.20

596

Us too.

597



598

00:12:25.21,00:12:26.24

599

I'm going for a walk.

600



601

00:12:31.69,00:12:34.48

602

Good morning.[br]Nice breasts by the way.

603



604

00:12:44.89,00:12:46.44

605

Hey, what happened to you?

606



607

00:12:46.65,00:12:49.92

608

Oh, nothing. I just felt like[br]hanging out and reading.

609



610

00:12:50.53,00:12:54.57

611

The water was so great. We jumped[br]off this pier and my suit came off.

612



613

00:12:56.09,00:12:57.44

614

Sorry I missed that.

615



616

00:12:57.65,00:12:59.72

617

Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

618



619

00:13:02.01,00:13:04.24

620

I brought back half the beach[br]in my hair.

621



622

00:13:04.49,00:13:06.48

623

It was easier when I shaved my head.

624



625

00:13:11.25,00:13:13.24

626

You know, I gotta tell you. . .

627



628

00:13:13.45,00:13:16.28

629

. . .I just loved your look[br]when you were bald.

630



631

00:13:16.93,00:13:18.12

632

Really?

633



634

00:13:18.93,00:13:21.49

635

I think about shaving it[br]again sometimes.

636



637

00:13:22.05,00:13:23.16

638

Really?

639



640

00:13:24.21,00:13:25.80

641

You definitely should do that.

642



643

00:13:26.93,00:13:28.84

644

You know what? I should do it!

645



646

00:13:29.09,00:13:31.68

647

You know what? Thank you.[br]You are so cool.

648



649

00:13:31.93,00:13:33.72

650

Oh, stop. Go on.

651



652

00:13:34.25,00:13:36.64

653

-Now go shave that head.[br]-All right.

654



655

00:13:47.73,00:13:49.05

656

What's the matter?

657



658

00:13:49.25,00:13:51.89

659

She canceled.[br]My namesake canceled on me.

660



661

00:13:52.13,00:13:55.44

662

She claims she had to go out of town.[br]She's avoiding me.

663



664

00:13:55.69,00:13:59.04

665

She doesn't want to tell me[br]where my father is. She knows!

666



667

00:13:59.29,00:14:01.32

668

Pheebs, that sucks.

669



670

00:14:02.45,00:14:05.24

671

Well, don't[br]"Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

672



673

00:14:06.25,00:14:08.64

674

-Where are you going?[br]-She's out of town.

675



676

00:14:08.89,00:14:11.48

677

Something in her house[br]will tell me where he is.

678



679

00:14:11.85,00:14:14.84

680

Some people call that[br]"breaking and entering. "

681



682

00:14:15.29,00:14:17.64

683

Well, are any of those people here?

684



685

00:14:18.89,00:14:21.20

686

Look, I'll do something nice, okay?

687



688

00:14:22.45,00:14:24.44

689

I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

690



691

00:14:26.37,00:14:27.32

692

Hey, everybody!

693



694

00:14:32.93,00:14:34.08

695

Look what you did!

696



697

00:14:35.85,00:14:36.96

698

You wanna touch it?

699



700

00:14:37.17,00:14:39.12

701

No, but it's great.

702



703

00:14:39.37,00:14:40.88

704

Come on, touch it.

705



706

00:14:45.01,00:14:47.92

707

You can feel all the bones[br]in your skull.

708



709

00:14:56.29,00:15:00.36

710

I was having a little chat[br]with Bonnie, and guess what?

711



712

00:15:00.61,00:15:03.72

713

She brought up who was[br]behind the head-shaving idea.

714



715

00:15:03.97,00:15:06.64

716

And now, who was it?[br]Oh, that's right. It was you!

717



718

00:15:08.41,00:15:10.28

719

That was her idea.

720



721

00:15:10.53,00:15:13.20

722

I just gave her a nudge.

723



724

00:15:13.45,00:15:15.64

725

She said you gave her the razor.

726



727

00:15:18.21,00:15:20.24

728

So anyone up for a midnight dip?

729



730

00:15:20.49,00:15:22.48

731

-No, I'm good.[br]-No, thanks.

732



733

00:15:22.73,00:15:25.64

734

-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.[br]-Okay, have fun.

735



736

00:15:26.93,00:15:30.04

737

Come on, see?[br]She doesn't look that bad.

738



739

00:15:30.81,00:15:33.88

740

You can see the moonlight[br]bouncing off her head!

741



742

00:15:35.41,00:15:36.68

743

What were you thinking?

744



745

00:15:36.93,00:15:38.08

746

I don't know.

747



748

00:15:38.33,00:15:39.92

749

You balded my girlfriend!

750



751

00:15:40.17,00:15:41.12

752

All right.

753



754

00:15:43.21,00:15:46.32

755

Do you think it's easy for me[br]to see you with somebody else?

756



757

00:15:46.57,00:15:48.48

758

You're the one who ended it!

759



760

00:15:48.73,00:15:52.56

761

Because I was mad at you![br]Not because I stopped loving you!

762



763

00:15:53.69,00:15:54.84

764

You still love me?

765



766

00:15:58.33,00:15:59.24

767

You still love me.

768



769

00:16:00.29,00:16:01.28

770

Yeah, so?

771



772

00:16:01.53,00:16:02.52

773

You love me.

774



775

00:16:07.69,00:16:09.04

776

What does this mean?

777



778

00:16:09.25,00:16:11.89

779

I mean, do you want[br]to get back together?

780



781

00:16:12.13,00:16:13.88

782

No! Maybe!

783



784

00:16:14.73,00:16:16.21

785

I don't know.

786



787

00:16:21.85,00:16:25.04

788

I still can't forgive you[br]for what you did.

789



790

00:16:25.53,00:16:28.36

791

But sometimes when I'm with you,[br]I just feel so. . . .

792



793

00:16:28.81,00:16:29.80

794

What?

795



796

00:16:30.93,00:16:32.44

797

I just feel. . . .

798



799

00:16:34.25,00:16:36.52

800

-I just--[br]-What?

801



802

00:16:37.01,00:16:37.80

803

I feel--

804



805

00:16:46.09,00:16:47.68

806

No! I don't care!

807



808

00:16:47.93,00:16:51.81

809

I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker[br]with you for practice!

810



811

00:16:52.13,00:16:54.08

812

But I made cards!

813



814

00:16:57.09,00:16:58.08

815

Good night.

816



817

00:16:59.05,00:17:00.60

818

I'm going upstairs.

819



820

00:17:01.13,00:17:02.84

821

-Good night.[br]-Good night.

822



823

00:17:09.53,00:17:11.84

824

Wanna play strip poker[br]for practice?

825



826

00:17:28.65,00:17:29.76

827

My ass!

828



829

00:18:07.49,00:18:08.89

830

Oh, it's me! It's me!

831



832

00:18:09.13,00:18:12.00

833

-I didn't wanna make any noise![br]-Then don't break in!

834



835

00:18:13.81,00:18:16.20

836

-I'm sorry![br]-What are you doing here?

837



838

00:18:16.73,00:18:20.24

839

I came to fill your ice cube tray.

840



841

00:18:21.45,00:18:22.32

842

What?

843



844

00:18:25.73,00:18:27.28

845

Okay, look.

846



847

00:18:28.69,00:18:32.47

848

I took this picture from your fridge.[br]I know that this is my father.

849



850

00:18:32.73,00:18:35.92

851

This is Frank Buffay, and you were[br]standing next to him!

852



853

00:18:36.49,00:18:38.76

854

I deserve to know where I came from.

855



856

00:18:39.01,00:18:42.04

857

So if you can help me find my father,[br]then you should.

858



859

00:18:42.25,00:18:44.36

860

Otherwise, you're just mean.

861



862

00:18:46.69,00:18:48.76

863

So just tell me the truth.

864



865

00:18:49.21,00:18:50.28

866

All right.

867



868

00:18:51.09,00:18:54.97

869

The man in that picture[br]is Chuck Mangione.

870



871

00:18:57.01,00:18:59.44

872

My father is Chuck Mangione?

873



874

00:18:59.89,00:19:01.56

875

That's just Chuck Mangione.

876



877

00:19:01.81,00:19:04.04

878

I sold him a house last year.

879



880

00:19:04.25,00:19:08.13

881

And I'm very sorry, but I really don't[br]know where your father is.

882



883

00:19:08.33,00:19:10.04

884

And that's the truth.

885



886

00:19:12.13,00:19:13.88

887

But you're right.

888



889

00:19:15.05,00:19:17.84

890

I think a person should know[br]where they come from.

891



892

00:19:18.53,00:19:20.40

893

Which is why l. . . .

894



895

00:19:29.13,00:19:30.56

896

I'm your mother.

897



898

00:19:35.61,00:19:38.64

899

I wanted to tell you[br]yesterday, but I just. . .

900



901

00:19:38.89,00:19:40.60

902

. . .felt all floopy, and. . . .

903



904

00:19:43.69,00:19:45.76

905

You guys are getting back together.

906



907

00:19:46.09,00:19:48.16

908

She doesn't even know what she wants.

909



910

00:19:48.41,00:19:50.32

911

Rachel's still mad at me.

912



913

00:19:50.57,00:19:53.68

914

Then you gotta back away.[br]You don't need that kind of hurt.

915



916

00:19:53.93,00:19:55.52

917

Take it from a guy who's. . .

918



919

00:19:55.97,00:19:58.88

920

. . .never had a long-term relationship.

921



922

00:19:59.85,00:20:04.16

923

I know, but I really want to go[br]up there and finish that kiss.

924



925

00:20:06.41,00:20:08.68

926

The water is great.[br]You should go in.

927



928

00:20:08.93,00:20:11.24

929

No, thanks. I just had an M&M.

930



931

00:20:12.53,00:20:13.36

932

Well, good night.

933



934

00:20:13.61,00:20:14.56

935

Good night.

936



937

00:20:15.89,00:20:16.88

938

Don't be too long.

939



940

00:20:17.13,00:20:18.48

941

Okey-dokey.

942



943

00:20:20.01,00:20:22.24

944

There is not one hair on that head.

945



946

00:20:22.49,00:20:26.88

947

It'll grow back, right?[br]And she's really fun, and she's cool.

948



949

00:20:27.13,00:20:28.88

950

And I'm finally moving on.

951



952

00:20:29.13,00:20:31.64

953

Getting over Rachel was so--

954



955

00:20:32.85,00:20:35.84

956

I'm finally feeling sane.[br]And if I go up there. . .

957



958

00:20:36.05,00:20:37.64

959

. . .and I kiss her. . . .

960



961

00:20:37.89,00:20:39.64

962

God, I want to kiss her!

963



964

00:20:40.53,00:20:44.16

965

And it doesn't work out. Do I wanna[br]put myself through that again?

966



967

00:20:44.41,00:20:45.68

968

Let me get this straight.

969



970

00:20:45.89,00:20:50.56

971

If you go with Bonnie, you do the[br]smart, healthy thing and move on.

972



973

00:20:50.81,00:20:54.12

974

Right? And if you go with Rachel,[br]Bonnie's free tonight?

975



976

00:21:18.13,00:21:18.96

977

Hi there.

978



979

00:21:20.81,00:21:22.96

980

That's that weird voice again.

981



982

00:21:23.21,00:21:24.43

983

Let me try it again.

984



985

00:21:24.65,00:21:27.24

986

You'll wanna date this next guy,[br]I swear!

987



988

00:21:32.57,00:21:33.92

989

Hi, I'm Dorf!

990



991

00:21:36.01,00:21:37.84

992

Your date for the evening.

993



994

00:21:40.21,00:21:43.40

995

Oh, come on. Dorf on dating?[br]That's good stuff!

996
