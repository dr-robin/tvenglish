00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:09
That's right. Daddy and Uncle Joeyare going on a trip today.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
We're going to a conference in Barbados.Right? Can you say, "Barbados"?

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
Barbados.

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
Okay. I've gotta say, it means so muchto me that you guys are coming...

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
...all the way over thereto hear me give my speech.

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
And I have a surprise.I had to pull some strings...

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
...but I was able to get everyone passesto the entire conference. That's right!

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
These babies will get you into allthe paleontology lectures and seminars.

10
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
Do you have anythingthat will get us out of them?

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
We're excited to hear the speech,but the rest of the time...

12
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
...we're gonna want to do island stuff.

13
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
David will probably want to heara few lectures.

14
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
- Right, because he's a scientist.- No, no.

15
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
He's been in Minsk for eight years.If he gets too much direct sunlight...

16
00:00:49 --> 00:00:50
...he'll die.

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
- Okay, we'd better go.- Yeah?

18
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
- So we'll see you guys tomorrow.- All right, let's do it.

19
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56

20
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
...get under that blanketand do what comes natural.

21
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
It's a blanket, Joe,not a cloak of invisibility.

00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
- Wow, this place is beautiful!- Look at all these paleontologists!

26
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
I know. There are gonna be somepasty folks by the pool tomorrow.

27
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
- My God, I can't believe you're here!- I think I've been recognized.

28
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
- This happens all the time.- Dr. Geller? I am such a huge fan.

29
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
That never happens.

30
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
I've been following your career for years.I can't wait for your keynote speech.

31
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
- Wow! This is very flattering.- I would love your autograph.

32
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
Well, sure.

33
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
- "Dear...?"- Sarah.

34
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
"Sarah. I dig you."

35
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
- "Dr. Ross Geller."- Oh, thank you so much.

36
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
Sure. Sarah, I'd like you to introduce youto my colleague, Professor Wheeler.

37
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
- And this is Joey Tribbiani.- Are you a paleontologist?

38
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
No, God, no, no.I'm an actor.

39
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
You probably recognize me from alittle show called "The Days of Our Lives."

40
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives."There's no "the."

41
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
Okay, Ross. Boy, you... Yeah.No, no. I play Dr. Drake Ramoray.

42
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
- I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.- You don't own a TV?

43
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
What's all your furniture pointed at?

44
00:02:57 --> 00:02:58
David, can you help me?

45
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
I'm trying to explain to Chandlerhow a plane stays in the air.

46
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
Certainly. That's a combinationof Bernoulli's Principle...

47
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
...and Newton's third law of motion.- See?

48
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
Yeah. That's the same as,"It has something to do with wind."

49
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
I'm gonna go pick up a few thingsfor the trip.

50
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
I should go too. Now, tomorrow do youwant to share a cab to the airport...

51
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
...or should Mike and I meet you?

52
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
Mike? Who's Mike?

53
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
- Mike's your ex-boyfriend.- That's right!

54
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
Oh, yeah.Wow, I had totally forgotten about him.

55
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
- That's a blast from the past, huh?- No, it's okay. Honest mistake.

56
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
It really doesn't mean anything.I mean, you know...

57
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
...Monica refers to Chandler as Richardall the time.

58
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
- She does?- Let's get you out of here.

59
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
Well, at least you took me downwith you.

60
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
I'm so sorry. I just...I keep thinking about Mike.

61
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
I'm crazy about David, andwe're having so much fun together.

62
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just...That's gonna go away, right?

63
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
- Well, I guess. In time.- Yeah.

64
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
I mean, my feelings for Richardare certainly gone.

65
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
You just did it again. Chandler. Yourfeelings for Chandler are certainly gone.

66
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung upon that Mike, huh?

67
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
I wouldn't read too much into it.

68
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Still, a girl calls youby her ex-boyfriend's name...

69
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
...that's not a good thing, right?- Let me stop you there.

70
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
Because I think I see where this is going.I'm not very good at giving advice.

71
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
See, if you want advice,go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...

72
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
...for advice about pizza toppingsor a burning sensation when you pee.

73
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
I'm sorry, I just wish therewas something I could do, you know?

74
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
- Well, you know Phoebe...- Seriously, we're gonna do this?

75
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
I'm sorry, I just wish I could make herforget about Mike already.

76
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
- Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?- Because his penis was too big.

77
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
I'm sorry. That's the kind of thing I do.

78
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
They broke up because Mikedidn't want to get married.

79
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
What if you let Phoebe knowyou'd be open to marriage?

80
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
That's great. That's great.I'll propose to her.

81
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
What?

82
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
I was probably going to do itat some point.

83
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
- No, I didn't mean now.- Well, why not? It's brilliant.

84
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
"Goodbye, Mike.We'll see you at the wedding, fella.

85
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
Well, we probably won't invite youto the wedding, but..."

86
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
- Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.- Well, you're welcome.

87
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Glad I could help.

88
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
- How do you think I should propose?- I'm pretending to read here.

89
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
Yeah. How you doing?Hey, how are you?

91
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
You said you were gonna wear a thong.Where's the thong?

92
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
I didn't mean a thong.I meant thongs.

93
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
You really should have beenmore clear about that.

94
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
You're never gonna guesswho I just saw downstairs.

95
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
Britney Spears!

96
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
Yeah.She never misses these conferences.

97
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
- No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!- Oh, my God!

98
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
- I know!- Did you talk to him?

99
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
Oh, yeah. What am I gonna sayto Kenneth Schwartz?

100
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
You could say, "Hey, Kenny,how come you're not Britney Spears?"

101
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
- You ready to go?- You're gonna go now?

102
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
- I thought we could hang out.- I can't. I have seminars all day.

103
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
I promised RossI'd look at his speech.

104
00:06:04 --> 00:06:09
But maybe we could have dinner later?Out on the balcony? Lt'll be romantic.

105
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
Will you wear a thong?

106
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
I will if you will.

107
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
You got yourself a very weird deal.

108
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
I'm good. I have dinner plans.

109
00:06:21 --> 00:06:22
- So you gonna be okay?- Yeah, yeah.

110
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
I got tons of stuff I could do.I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.

111
00:06:26 --> 00:06:27
Joe, have you looked outside?

112
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
No. Why?

113
00:06:32 --> 00:06:33
- Oh, man.- There's an indoor pool.

114
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
- You could swim there.- Yeah.

115
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
I wasn't gonna swim.I was gonna dig a hole.

116
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
That Mike thing was interesting.I don't know what's gonna happen...

117
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
...with Phoebe and David.- I do. Want a hint, huh?

118
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
I do.

119
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
I do.

120
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
Okay, I'm sensing this issome kind of wordplay...

121
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
...because you are pinkwith barely controlled glee.

122
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
- David's gonna propose to Phoebe.- What? Why?

123
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Because we were talking about wayshe could beat Mike...

124
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
...and I told him Phoebe wantedto get married.

125
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
Chandler, we have talked about this.

126
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
You are not supposed to givepeople advice!

127
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
Couldn't you have madesome inappropriate joke?

128
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
I did! A penis one!

129
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
Just so I know, what was so wrongabout what I said?

130
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
They've only been going outfor a few weeks.

131
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.I mean, she'll say no...

132
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
...David's heart will be broken,it'll be too hard for them to recover...

133
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
...and then Phoebe will end upalone again.

134
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
Man, that's some bad advice.

135
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
Oh, hey.Thank God. You guys are here.

136
00:07:40 --> 00:07:43
- What's going on?- Everything is upside-down here.

137
00:07:43 --> 00:07:47
It rains all day long and nobodywatches TV, and Ross is famous.

138
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
I don't want to alarm anybody...

139
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
...but Monica's hair is twice as bigas it was when we landed.

140
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
Okay. When I go placeswith high humidity...

141
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
...it gets a little extra body, okay?

142
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
That's why our honeymoon photoslook like me and Diana Ross.

143
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
I'll show you guys where to check in.

144
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
Oh, honey? Can you make surewe get a king-size bed?

145
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh, andsee if they have a heart-shaped one.

146
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
And with mirrors on the ceiling.

147
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
And make sure our roomisn't next to theirs.

148
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
Oh, you guys are so luckyyou're here with people.

149
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
You know, it's justsuch a romantic place.

150
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
I just wish I could share it with a guy.

151
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
- Not Joey.- Not Joey. No.

152
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
- I was just lusting after Chandler.- Yeah, right.

153
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
So... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.

154
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
Tonight?

155
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
Isn't an engagement ringsupposed to have a diamond?

156
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
Oh, there it is.

157
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Yes, well, being a failed scientist doesn'tpay quite as well as you might think.

158
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
That's one-seventieth of a carat.

159
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
And the clarity is quite poor.

160
00:08:56 --> 00:08:57
Nice.

161
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
- Monica, can I talk to you for a second?- Okay.

162
00:09:01 --> 00:09:02
David's gonna proposeto Phoebe tonight.

163
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
See what happenswhen you give people advice?

164
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
- Well, I hope you told him not to.- That would be advice!

165
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
Okay, fine. I'll handle this.

166
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
- Phoebe?- Yeah?

167
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
- I need to talk to you.- Are you leaving the Supremes?

168
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
Okay, my husband just gaveyour boyfriend some very bad advice.

169
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
David's gonna propose to you tonight.

170
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
Wow, really?

171
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
That's fantastic!

172
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
What? Are you serious?You want to marry him?

173
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
- What about Mike?- Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?

174
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...

175
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
...and force him down the aisle, okay?

176
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
I can just see it."Mike, do you take Phoebe?"

177
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
You know? It's every girl's dream.

178
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
Do you really think marryingsomeone else is the right answer?

179
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?I love Mike... David!

180
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
David! I love David.

181
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
Don't look at me that way,Roseanne Roseannadanna.

182
00:10:05 --> 00:10:09
"By using CT scans and computerimaging, we can, in a very real way...

183
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
...bring the Mesozoic Erainto the 21 st century."

184
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
It's great. You'll be the hitof the conference.

185
00:10:18 --> 00:10:19
It'll be even better tomorrow...

186
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
...because I won't be constantlyinterrupted by Joey...

187
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
...checking to see if they putchocolates on my pillow yet.

188
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
- Hey, guys.- The chocolates aren't here.

189
00:10:29 --> 00:10:30
Damn it!

190
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
Ross just read me his speech.It's fantastic.

191
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
Oh, is it on the computer?Because I'd love to give it a read.

192
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
If you want to check your e-mail,just ask.

193
00:10:38 --> 00:10:39
What? May I?

194
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean,when I signed up for dino week...

195
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
...nobody said anythingabout it being monsoon season.

196
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
- The wet season is June to December.- It's not the time, Charlie.

197
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!

198
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
What, did someone outbid youfor the teapot?

199
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
Secret teapot.

200
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
Your computer. I don't know what...Everything's gone.

201
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
- What do you mean?- Must be a virus.

202
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
I think it erased your hard drive.

203
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?

204
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mailand I opened it.

205
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
- Why? Why would you open it?- Well, it didn't say, "This is a virus."

206
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
- What did it say?- "Nude..."

207
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
"Pictures of Anna Kournikova."

208
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
- I'm so sorry.- What am I gonna do?

209
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
- My speech is gone!- It's not gone.

210
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
I'm sure you printed out a copy.You have a hard copy?

211
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
No, I don't!

212
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
Well, you must be pretty madat yourself right now.

213
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
- It's really gone?- Yep.

214
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
I'd like to thank you guysfor coming down here...

215
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
...to complain about the rainand ruin my career.

216
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
- I just feel awful.- Yeah, you should.

217
00:11:47 --> 00:11:52
Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? She'snever even won a major tournament.

218
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
Well, I tried Billie Jean King, but...

219
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
You know, you and Monica havethe same I'm-gonna-kill-you look.

220
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
I can usually make it go awayby kissing her.

221
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
Get out.

222
00:12:04 --> 00:12:07
You know, this happens all the timeto my computer at work.

223
00:12:07 --> 00:12:08
- What do you do?- I usually go...

224
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
...play Tetris on somebody else'scomputer.

225
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
I can't believe this is happening.

226
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
I have to give the keynote speechtomorrow.

227
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
I have to stand up in front of allthese people. What am I gonna say?

228
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
You can use a speech I memorizedfor auditions.

229
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
I don't think your monologue from"Star Wars" is gonna help me right now.

230
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
Ross, we can solve this.I just heard your speech.

231
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
- We can re-create it. We've got all night.- What, you really think we can do that?

232
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
Oh, wait.Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.

233
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
Don't worry about that.I mean, Ross needs you.

234
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
Rachel and I will stay and helpany way we can.

235
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
All right. Okay, let's do it.

236
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
Well, I know we start by discussingthe shortcomings of carbon dating.

237
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
And then I move on to what is clearlythe defining moment...

238
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
...of the Mesozoic Era,the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?

239
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
And then there's the overviewof the Triassic.

240
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Any chance any of this happenedin a galaxy far, far away?

241
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
- Hello?"- Okay", "Mike?"

242
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
Enough is enough.You love Phoebe, and she loves you.

243
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
So get over yourl-never-wanna-get-married thing...

244
00:13:11 --> 00:13:12
...and step up!

245
00:13:12 --> 00:13:13
Who is this?

246
00:13:14 --> 00:13:15
"This is Monica", "Phoebe's friend."

247
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
Phoebe is back with David.

248
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
He's gonna propose,and she's gonna say yes...

249
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
...but I know she really wants to bewith you.

250
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
He's gonna propose?

251
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
I'm sorry, did you say something?I can't hear through all this damned hair!

252
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
If Phoebe wants to marry David,she should.

253
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.Neither should you.

254
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
You don't tell me what to do.I tell you what to do.

255
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotelin Barbados.

256
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
And while I've got you,you've got curly hair.

257
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
What do you do in the humidity?

258
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
Damn it!

259
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
- Well, I hope you're happy.- I hope you're happy too, honey.

260
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.

261
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
- That's what happens when you meddle.- Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.

262
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
No, it's not.She's still in love with Mike.

263
00:14:00 --> 00:14:01
- There's no chance that will work?- No, I called.

264
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
- It's not gonna happen.- Meddler! Meddler!

265
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
If you hadn't meddled to start with...

266
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
...then I wouldn't have had to go inand meddle myself.

267
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
No matter how much we meddle,we'll never be able to unmeddle...

268
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
...the thing that you meddled upin the first place!

269
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
This vacation sucks!

270
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
I'm so bored.

271
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
Stupid rain. We can't do anything.

272
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
Well, I brought some books.We could read.

273
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.

274
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.

275
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
I'm sorry, sir, these arefor the pharmaceutical convention.

276
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
You feel like going to a convention?

277
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
- We can't. We're not pharmacists.- I know we're not...

278
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
...but Frank Madaio and Eva...

279
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
- Kate Miller.- Kate Miller it is.

280
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
- Okay.- Oh, good...

281
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
And that's the most sexI'm gonna have this weekend.

282
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
Well, in that case,should I make sure it's on real good?

283
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
Thank you.

284
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
Oh, and then you said that thing aboutbringing the Mesozoic Era...

285
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
...into the 21 st century.

286
00:15:13 --> 00:15:14
Well, yeah. That's it?

287
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
- Yeah.- Oh, my God. We did it.

288
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
Actually, I did it, Ross. You rememberedshockingly little of your own speech.

289
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
Yes, but I did make a pyramidout of the bath products.

290
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
Oh, this is amazing.Thank you. Thank you so much.

291
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
That's a pretty necklace.

292
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
Thank you.

293
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?Champagne?

294
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,we can fill the bottle with water...

295
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
...and put it back so theydon't charge you.

296
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
Oh, my God, I love you.

297
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
This is such a cute picture of Emma.And is this your son...

298
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
...or just some kid whose pictureyou bring on vacation?

299
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
That's Ben, my sonfrom my first marriage.

300
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
- Your first marriage?- Yeah.

301
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
You've been married more than once?

302
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
No.

303
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
So why'd you break up?

304
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
Oh, it was...

305
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
It's complicated, you know?She was...

306
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
...gay.- Oh, my God.

307
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
This is so cool!

308
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
Okay.Odd thing to get excited about.

309
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
No, it's just that I was engagedto a guy who turned out to be gay.

310
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
Hey! High-five!

311
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Didn't you feel so stupidthat you didn't see the signs?

312
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
My fiance was always going onlong weekends with his "tennis partner."

313
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
My wife had a workout friend she wentto the gym with every day for a year.

314
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
She didn't get any fitter.

315
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
- Everybody's like, "I knew all along."- I know.

316
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?I mean, call, leave a note.

317
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
"Hi. Just dropped byto say your wife's gay."

318
00:16:44 --> 00:16:45
- I know.- And then...

319
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
And then you try to make the bestof a bad situation...

320
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
...so you float the idea of a threesome.

321
00:16:51 --> 00:16:52
I didn't do that.

322
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
Me neither.

323
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.

324
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
I know. That old lady at the endwas ready to take you home.

325
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
Not enough pills in the world, Rach.

326
00:17:07 --> 00:17:10
What about you, huh? You're the singleone. See anybody in there you like?

327
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
Well, let's see. There was thatreally big guy that I was talking to...

328
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
...with the really nice breasts.

329
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
But what about back home? Anythinggoing on there? Anybody you like?

330
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
No.

331
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
- There is. You're blushing.- No, I'm not blushing...

332
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
...and I'm sunburned.

333
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
From, you know, the rain.

334
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
You like someone. Tell me who.

335
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
- Tell me who it is. Come on.- No. Joey.

336
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
Who do you like?You're not getting away that easy.

337
00:17:38 --> 00:17:39
- Who do you like?- Joey, come on!

338
00:17:40 --> 00:17:43
It doesn't matter, you know?It's not like anything's gonna happen.

339
00:17:43 --> 00:17:47
What? Why not?Rach, who can you not get?

340
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
Okay. Okay.You really want to know who it is?

341
00:17:55 --> 00:17:57
- Yeah. Who is it?- Do you?

342
00:17:58 --> 00:18:00
- Oh, hey.- I just left you a message.

343
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite...

344
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
...but now that you're here,we could have that dinner.

345
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
Right! Of course.Hey, did you guys finish the speech?

346
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
Yep! We got it. We got it.Thank you so much.

347
00:18:09 --> 00:18:11
- I had a great time.- Yeah.

348
00:18:11 --> 00:18:13
This isn't over,because I really want to know...

349
00:18:13 --> 00:18:14
Later. Later.

350
00:18:15 --> 00:18:17
- So shall we?- Yeah.

351
00:18:17 --> 00:18:18
- Okay.- Good night.

352
00:18:19 --> 00:18:20
Good night.

353
00:18:25 --> 00:18:28
- Okay, good night.- Good night, Ross.

354
00:18:32 --> 00:18:33
I can't believe she's gonnasay yes to David.

355
00:18:34 --> 00:18:35
She's clearly in love with Mike.

356
00:18:35 --> 00:18:39
You know, it's very hard to take youseriously when you look like that.

357
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
Phoebe, I have something I want to say.

358
00:18:46 --> 00:18:49
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.I cannot watch this. Let's go.

359
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
I think we have time.Have you heard him talk?

360
00:18:51 --> 00:18:55
"Phoebe, I would be honored if..."Spit it out, David!

361
00:18:57 --> 00:18:58
Phoebe.

362
00:19:00 --> 00:19:05
You're an amazing woman, and the timewe spent apart was unbearable.

363
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minskdidn't help.

364
00:19:08 --> 00:19:10
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

365
00:19:10 --> 00:19:15
But, well, now that we're togetheragain, I don't ever want to be apart.

366
00:19:15 --> 00:19:18
So to that end...

367
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
- Oh, my God, Mike.- It's David, actually.

368
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
No, Mike's here.

369
00:19:26 --> 00:19:27
Oh, hey, Mike.

370
00:19:28 --> 00:19:30
Hi, David.

371
00:19:30 --> 00:19:33
Chandler. Monic... Oh!

372
00:19:35 --> 00:19:37
It's the humidity!

373
00:19:39 --> 00:19:42
- Hi, Phoebe.- What are you doing here?

374
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
I have a question I need to ask you.

375
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
I have a question I was kind ofgonna ask her myself.

376
00:19:48 --> 00:19:51
Yeah, I understand, but before you do,she really needs to hear this.

377
00:19:53 --> 00:19:54
Okay.

378
00:19:54 --> 00:19:58
- Would you care for my seat as well?- Actually, yeah, that'd be great.

379
00:19:59 --> 00:20:00
Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.

380
00:20:10 --> 00:20:11
Phoebe, I love you.

381
00:20:11 --> 00:20:14
I've missed you so muchthese last few months.

382
00:20:14 --> 00:20:15
I thought we were apartfor a good reason...

383
00:20:16 --> 00:20:18
...but I realized that there was no reasongood enough...

384
00:20:18 --> 00:20:21
...to keep me from spendingthe rest of my life with you.

385
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
Kind of steps on the toesof what I was going to say.

386
00:20:25 --> 00:20:27
I'm sorry, David,but she really has to know this.

387
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
All right, but after this,I want to see you outside.

388
00:20:30 --> 00:20:31
If the rain stops.

389
00:20:34 --> 00:20:37
You're the most incredible womanI've ever met.

390
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
How could I lose you?Now, I don't actually have a ring.

391
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
- I have a ring.- I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.

392
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
But, Phoebe...

393
00:20:48 --> 00:20:50
...will you marry me?

394
00:20:52 --> 00:20:53
No.

395
00:21:00 --> 00:21:03
I love you, but I never neededa proposal from you.

396
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
I just needed to knowwe were headed somewhere.

397
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
- That we had a future.- We can have any future you want.

398
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.

399
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
David, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

400
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
Just so I know, if I had asked first...?

401
00:21:23 --> 00:21:28
Yeah, I might have said yes,but that would've been wrong.

402
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
Please, you don't have to explain.

403
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32
I mean, perhaps if I hadn'tgone to Minsk...

404
00:21:33 --> 00:21:37
...things would have worked out for us,and I wouldn't have ruined my career.

405
00:21:37 --> 00:21:39
Or lost that toe to frostbite.

406
00:21:40 --> 00:21:41
It was a good trip.

407
00:21:44 --> 00:21:46
- Is it okay if I hug you now?- Oh, yes.

408
00:21:49 --> 00:21:51
Because of our meddling! All right?

409
00:21:58 --> 00:22:02
Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.I could just lie here all day.

410
00:22:02 --> 00:22:04
Oh, I know.

411
00:22:05 --> 00:22:09
- Open your drapes! Open your drapes!- So glad we got adjoining rooms.

412
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
- The sun is out!- Hey! Remember when I had corneas?

413
00:22:13 --> 00:22:15
Go to the pool and reserve chairs.

414
00:22:15 --> 00:22:18
- I will get the magazines and the lotion.- Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.

415
00:22:19 --> 00:22:20
- No!- Damn it!

416
00:22:21 --> 00:22:23
Walls are pretty thin, guys.

417
00:22:28 --> 00:22:32
"Then we have to weigh the data fromrecent MRI scans and DNA testing...

418
00:22:32 --> 00:22:36
...which call into question informationgathered from years of carbon dating."

419
00:22:37 --> 00:22:40
Look at the woman sitting outby the pool getting tan.

420
00:22:40 --> 00:22:43
She's all leathery and wrinkled.I'm so jealous!

421
00:22:43 --> 00:22:46
"Finally, factor in the profusionof new species recently discovered.

422
00:22:47 --> 00:22:48
Giganotosaurus.

423
00:22:49 --> 00:22:52
"- Argentinosaurus."- Not to mention "Coldsaurus."

424
00:22:54 --> 00:22:57
"And that's just the herbivores. I'm noteven gonna discuss the carnivores.

425
00:22:57 --> 00:22:59
Their heads are already too big.

426
00:22:59 --> 00:23:02
Which is ironic, consideringtheir stunted cerebral development."

427
00:23:06 --> 00:23:07
Really?

428
00:23:09 --> 00:23:11
"But all kidding aside,in much the same way...

429
00:23:11 --> 00:23:15
...that "Homo ergaster" is thought to be aseparate species from "Homo erectus"..."

430
00:23:18 --> 00:23:21
- What?- He said "erectus."

431
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
- You're kidding, right?- No, he really said it.

432
00:23:25 --> 00:23:27
"And while there are certainlyvast differences...

433
00:23:27 --> 00:23:31
...between these Mesozoic fossilsand the example of "Homo erectus"..."

434
00:23:33 --> 00:23:34
"Erectus"?

435
00:23:34 --> 00:23:36
- Homo.- Right.

436
00:23:38 --> 00:23:42
"In a very real way, we can bringthe Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century."

437
00:23:42 --> 00:23:44
Thank you.

438
00:23:49 --> 00:23:50
- Really great.- Oh, thanks, guys.

439
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
I thought it was wonderful.Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.

440
00:23:55 --> 00:24:00
I mean, the ideas you put forth,and from someone so young and...

441
00:24:04 --> 00:24:06
Okay, now we're just holding hands.

442
00:24:07 --> 00:24:10
Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.That was really great.

443
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
- Oh, thank you.- Yeah. Oh, and so funny.

444
00:24:13 --> 00:24:16
- Take it easy.- All right, thanks. Thanks so much.

445
00:24:16 --> 00:24:18
I can't tell you how much it meansthat you were here.

446
00:24:18 --> 00:24:19
You kidding?We wouldn't have missed it.

447
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
I'm back.

448
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
Okay. Well, excuse me?

449
00:24:29 --> 00:24:30
- Well?- You were incredible.

450
00:24:30 --> 00:24:31
You blew them away.

451
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
I can't tell you how great it wasto look in the crowd and see your face.

452
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
I mean, did you know you weremouthing the words along with me?

453
00:24:38 --> 00:24:39
- I was not.- No, it's okay.

454
00:24:39 --> 00:24:42
It made me feel like a rock star.

455
00:24:42 --> 00:24:44
Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.

456
00:24:45 --> 00:24:47
Hey, I better not find you nakedin my hotel room.

457
00:24:50 --> 00:24:52
Look, I took it too far.

458
00:24:57 --> 00:24:59
I can't believe it's raining again.It's so unfair.

459
00:24:59 --> 00:25:02
Well, on the bright side,now we won't have to see...

460
00:25:02 --> 00:25:05
...all these paleontologistswith their shirts off.

461
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
Not you guys.

462
00:25:08 --> 00:25:10
You've got it going on.

463
00:25:13 --> 00:25:15
- What will we do today?- They have a game room downstairs.

464
00:25:15 --> 00:25:17
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.

465
00:25:17 --> 00:25:18
Ping-Pong?Honey, they have Ping-Pong.

466
00:25:18 --> 00:25:20
- Let's play.- I don't think so.

467
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
- Why not?- You know how competitive you get.

468
00:25:23 --> 00:25:26
And while I say it's cute,others disagree, and I'm lying.

469
00:25:27 --> 00:25:29
- I'm not always that bad.- Oh, yeah?

470
00:25:29 --> 00:25:31
What happened when we playedlast time?

471
00:25:31 --> 00:25:33
I punched you.

472
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
- And?- Phoebe.

473
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
- And?- I clunked your heads together.

474
00:25:55 --> 00:25:56
- There you are.- Hey. Listen.

475
00:25:56 --> 00:25:59
As soon as it stops raining,we have got to go snorkeling.

476
00:25:59 --> 00:26:02
Some kid told me about this sea turtle.If you blow bubbles in his face...

477
00:26:02 --> 00:26:04
...he chases you.

478
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm runninga discussion group all afternoon.

479
00:26:08 --> 00:26:10
That's okay.I'll find someone else to do it.

480
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
I'd do it alone, but...

481
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
...I don't know what happensif the sea turtle catches you.

482
00:26:15 --> 00:26:17
You know, I feel so bad.

483
00:26:17 --> 00:26:19
I haven't seen you this whole trip.Especially last night...

484
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
Don't worry about it. It was fine.I had the best time with Rachel.

485
00:26:23 --> 00:26:26
I just felt bad for you, stuckin that room working on Ross' speech.

486
00:26:26 --> 00:26:28
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.

487
00:26:29 --> 00:26:32
Oh, well, at leastwe're both having fun, right?

488
00:26:33 --> 00:26:36
- Is it weird that it's not with each other?- Yeah.

489
00:26:36 --> 00:26:37
A little bit, yeah.

490
00:26:41 --> 00:26:43
I think we need to talk.

491
00:26:44 --> 00:26:46
Yeah, I think we do.

492
00:26:48 --> 00:26:49
About what?

493
00:26:52 --> 00:26:54
- Come on, you guys, it'll be fun!- All right.

494
00:26:54 --> 00:26:57
- I'll play if we don't keep score.- Well, then how do we know who wins?

495
00:26:58 --> 00:27:02
- Nobody wins.- So we're just four losers. Super.

496
00:27:03 --> 00:27:05
- Well, I'm not playing with her.- I'm out.

497
00:27:05 --> 00:27:06
- I'll play you.- Okay.

498
00:27:06 --> 00:27:08
- You don't know what you're doing.- She gets crazy.

499
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
This scar? That's from Pictionary.

500
00:27:12 --> 00:27:14
I think I'll be all right.

501
00:27:14 --> 00:27:17
- You want to volley a bit for serve?- Sure, if you want to.

502
00:27:22 --> 00:27:24
Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.

503
00:27:27 --> 00:27:28
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.

504
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
- You ready to play?- Hell, yeah.

505
00:27:31 --> 00:27:35
- Did you know this about him?- No idea. I thought he was soft like you.

506
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
- Want to make it more interesting?- How much you thinking?

507
00:27:38 --> 00:27:39
- Ten bucks a game?- Make it 50.

508
00:27:40 --> 00:27:41
- I'll make it 100.- One thousand...

509
00:27:41 --> 00:27:42
Okay!

510
00:27:43 --> 00:27:45
We'll flip to see who goes first.You got a quarter?

511
00:27:45 --> 00:27:48
No. Either of you girls got a quarter?

512
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
Honey, try to focus the trash talkon him.

513
00:27:52 --> 00:27:54
- Monica, you call it.- Heads. No, tails! Heads!

514
00:27:54 --> 00:27:56
- Tails.- Oh, what are the chances?

515
00:28:00 --> 00:28:02
- My point!- Oh, no, I don't think so.

516
00:28:02 --> 00:28:05
Standard rules: If at any time a playeruses his nonracket-bearing hand...

517
00:28:05 --> 00:28:08
...to touch the playing surface,he or she forfeits the point.

518
00:28:10 --> 00:28:12
He was a lawyer.

519
00:28:14 --> 00:28:15
is having beautiful weather.

520
00:28:16 --> 00:28:17
"In New York", "it's 72 and sunny."

521
00:28:18 --> 00:28:19
Weather bitch.

522
00:28:21 --> 00:28:22
It's open.

523
00:28:23 --> 00:28:25
- Hi, Joe.- Hey.

524
00:28:25 --> 00:28:28
- What? Is everything okay?- Charlie and I broke up.

525
00:28:28 --> 00:28:30
No. Why?

526
00:28:30 --> 00:28:32
Well, she saidwe have nothing in common.

527
00:28:33 --> 00:28:34
That's crazy.

528
00:28:35 --> 00:28:36
No, it's not.We have nothing in common.

529
00:28:37 --> 00:28:39
- Yeah, that's true.- Yeah.

530
00:28:39 --> 00:28:42
I mean, she should be with someonemore like Ross.

531
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
You know, I mean he usesall those big words too.

532
00:28:44 --> 00:28:48
- Man, smart people are dull.- Well, hey!

533
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
Okay, Rach.

534
00:28:50 --> 00:28:55
I feel so stupid, you know? Why do Ikeep going after the wrong girls?

535
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
- What are you talking about?- Oh, come on.

536
00:28:58 --> 00:29:02
I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie.It's like... What the hell's my problem?

537
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
I just...

538
00:29:07 --> 00:29:12
Okay. Maybe you're notalways going after the wrong girl.

539
00:29:12 --> 00:29:14
I'm telling you, Rach,Charlie is not right for me.

540
00:29:14 --> 00:29:17
- I'm not talking about her.- Well, then, who?

541
00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
The waitress I went out with last month?

542
00:29:20 --> 00:29:22
- You know what? Forget it.- No, no, no, no.

543
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
- Who are you talking about?- No, I don't...

544
00:29:24 --> 00:29:26
I actually don't know whoI'm talking about, so...

545
00:29:27 --> 00:29:28
- Okay.- Yeah.

546
00:29:28 --> 00:29:31
Well, I'm gonna go seeif I can get a room for tonight.

547
00:29:31 --> 00:29:34
- And I'll see you later.- Yeah, sure. Okay.

548
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
- You like me?- Okay.

549
00:29:57 --> 00:29:59
- Let's not make a big thing about this.- It's a huge thing!

550
00:29:59 --> 00:30:01
Okay, not working with me, Joe.

551
00:30:01 --> 00:30:05
Look, here's the thing.Lately, I have been having thoughts.

552
00:30:06 --> 00:30:07
Musings, if you will.

553
00:30:09 --> 00:30:11
- Well, for how long?- Oh, only like a month.

554
00:30:11 --> 00:30:12
- A month?- Well...

555
00:30:12 --> 00:30:17
Dial it down. Listen, maybe they'recrazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.

556
00:30:17 --> 00:30:19
I have been thinking about,you know, us.

557
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
- Okay, dial it up a little.- Oh, you're right. Okay.

558
00:30:24 --> 00:30:25
- I just have a question.- Shoot.

559
00:30:25 --> 00:30:28
- What the hell are you doing?- I'm not trying to do anything.

560
00:30:28 --> 00:30:31
It's just, we have such a good timewhen we're together, you know?

561
00:30:31 --> 00:30:34
And I mean, aren't you justa little curious what it would be like?

562
00:30:34 --> 00:30:37
Am I curious?I mean, I'm as curious as...

563
00:30:38 --> 00:30:40
...George!

564
00:30:41 --> 00:30:43
- Who?- Curious George!

565
00:30:43 --> 00:30:45
You know, the monkey and the guywith the yellow hat.

566
00:30:45 --> 00:30:47
- Of course. I remember.- He had a paper route.

567
00:30:47 --> 00:30:49
Yeah, he did.

568
00:30:49 --> 00:30:52
- See, this is what I'm talking about.- No, I know. We're great!

569
00:30:52 --> 00:30:54
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.

570
00:30:54 --> 00:30:57
Can't it just happen a little bit?

571
00:30:59 --> 00:31:02
- No! It can't happen at all!- Why not?

572
00:31:02 --> 00:31:05
Because, look, no one wantsthis to happen more than me, okay?

573
00:31:05 --> 00:31:08
I have gone over this momentin my head 100 times...

574
00:31:08 --> 00:31:11
...and not once did I ever say no.

575
00:31:14 --> 00:31:16
I couldn't do it to Ross.

576
00:31:17 --> 00:31:19
- But that wasn't gonna stop you before.- I know. I know...

577
00:31:19 --> 00:31:23
...but I've thought about it a lotsince then, and it just wouldn't be right.

578
00:31:26 --> 00:31:27
I'm sorry.

579
00:31:29 --> 00:31:31
I'm sorry too.

580
00:31:32 --> 00:31:34
- Oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.- No, no.

581
00:31:34 --> 00:31:36
No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.

582
00:31:36 --> 00:31:38
- Like you said, it's no big deal.- It's not a big deal.

583
00:31:38 --> 00:31:40
- No big deal.- It's so not a big deal.

584
00:31:40 --> 00:31:42
- I'll see you later. All right, hey.- Okay, great.

585
00:31:58 --> 00:32:00
Okay...

586
00:32:10 --> 00:32:13
Oh, I'm sorry, I think...I think that may have missed the table.

587
00:32:14 --> 00:32:15
- Oh, do you?- Yeah.

588
00:32:15 --> 00:32:16
- Do you?- Yeah.

589
00:32:16 --> 00:32:18
- Do you?- Yeah!

590
00:32:18 --> 00:32:21
- You really find this attractive on him?- Oh, yeah.

591
00:32:21 --> 00:32:24
Are you telling me you're not evena little turned on by Monica right now?

592
00:32:29 --> 00:32:32
This is the first time in our marriage thatI've felt like the more attractive one.

593
00:32:33 --> 00:32:35
All right, come on, Mike.You can beat her.

594
00:32:35 --> 00:32:37
Knock that dog off her head.

595
00:32:40 --> 00:32:42
- Damn it!- I sleep with him!

596
00:32:43 --> 00:32:45
- Game point.- Don't get too cocky.

597
00:32:46 --> 00:32:47
Remember, I won the last one.

598
00:32:47 --> 00:32:49
Oh, by the way,how did that feel, losing to a girl?

599
00:32:50 --> 00:32:52
You should look in the mirrorbefore you call yourself that.

600
00:32:55 --> 00:32:58
- No! No! No!- And that's how it's done.

601
00:32:59 --> 00:33:00
Okey-dokey.

602
00:33:00 --> 00:33:03
You've each won a game, and I've lostwhat's felt like a year of my life.

603
00:33:03 --> 00:33:05
Everybody goes home a winner.

604
00:33:05 --> 00:33:06
- Best of three?- That's what I'm thinking.

605
00:33:06 --> 00:33:10
Should I use my invisibilityto fight crime or for evil?

606
00:33:11 --> 00:33:13
- Serve the ball, chump.- "Serve the ball, chump."

607
00:33:13 --> 00:33:16
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.Better comebacks.

608
00:33:18 --> 00:33:20
I'm just saying,I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.

609
00:33:21 --> 00:33:24
If you ever want to get awayfrom the city, well, that'd be...

610
00:33:24 --> 00:33:26
...just nifty.

611
00:33:28 --> 00:33:32
Well, I've kind of got a lot on my plateright now.

612
00:33:32 --> 00:33:35
Not that I wouldn't love a weekendin the country with a strange man.

613
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
- Jarvis?- Oh, you're back.

614
00:33:40 --> 00:33:43
- This is my wife, Nancy.- Well, get out!

615
00:33:45 --> 00:33:47
- Ross? Can I talk to you for a minute?- Yes, please.

616
00:33:49 --> 00:33:52
So, what's going on?

617
00:33:53 --> 00:33:56
Well, Joey and I broke up.

618
00:33:57 --> 00:34:01
- Oh, my God. What happened?- Joey is a great guy...

619
00:34:01 --> 00:34:03
...but we're just...We're so different.

620
00:34:03 --> 00:34:06
I mean, like, during your speech,he kept laughing at "Homo erectus."

621
00:34:06 --> 00:34:08
I knew that was him!

622
00:34:09 --> 00:34:13
Anyway, I just...I think it's for the best.

623
00:34:13 --> 00:34:17
- Hey. Hey, you okay?- I guess.

624
00:34:19 --> 00:34:20
There was...

625
00:34:21 --> 00:34:25
There was another reason that I thoughtit was time to end it with Joey.

626
00:34:26 --> 00:34:30
I started to realize that I washaving feelings for someone else.

627
00:34:32 --> 00:34:34
Okay, Geller.Last day of the conference.

628
00:34:34 --> 00:34:36
You know what happensto the keynote speaker.

629
00:34:36 --> 00:34:38
Professor Klarik, we're in the middleof a conversation here.

630
00:34:39 --> 00:34:42
- Can't you throw him in the pool later?- Or we could throw you both in now.

631
00:34:42 --> 00:34:45
Okay, gentlemen, please.Aren't we a little old for this?

632
00:34:45 --> 00:34:47
I mean, we're scientists, all right?We're academics...

633
00:34:47 --> 00:34:51
...and most importantly,you will have to catch us first.

634
00:34:51 --> 00:34:53
Go! Go! Go!

635
00:35:00 --> 00:35:02
Okay, so it's tied again,41 to 41.

636
00:35:03 --> 00:35:06
- Okay, look, enough is enough.- No.

637
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
- I just have two more points to beat him.- Monica, that was also true an hour ago!

638
00:35:09 --> 00:35:11
I mean, please, look at you.

639
00:35:11 --> 00:35:14
Your hand is blistered, you canbarely stand, your hair is inexplicable!

640
00:35:16 --> 00:35:18
You've already provenyou're just as good as he is.

641
00:35:18 --> 00:35:20
We missed our dinner reservations,so let's just go upstairs...

642
00:35:21 --> 00:35:23
...order room service, take a showerand shave your head!

643
00:35:24 --> 00:35:27
I can't just walk away.I've put in four hours.

644
00:35:27 --> 00:35:29
You knew this about mewhen you married me.

645
00:35:29 --> 00:35:32
You agreed to take me in sicknessand in health.

646
00:35:32 --> 00:35:34
Well, this is my sickness!

647
00:35:34 --> 00:35:37
- What about the obsessive cleaning?- That's just good sense.

648
00:35:43 --> 00:35:45
- You okay?- No, honey, I'm okay.

649
00:35:45 --> 00:35:48
Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.No shaking. No shaking.

650
00:35:51 --> 00:35:54
Oh, my God. I can't play.

651
00:35:54 --> 00:35:56
- So you forfeit?- Mike wins?

652
00:35:56 --> 00:35:59
I can't believe it. I lost.

653
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
- No, you didn't.- What?

654
00:36:05 --> 00:36:07
- Because I'm gonna play for you.- You can't do that.

655
00:36:07 --> 00:36:10
It's okay.I don't care which of them I beat.

656
00:36:11 --> 00:36:14
Okay, we're taking that paddle home,mister.

657
00:36:17 --> 00:36:18
- Honey, you don't have to do this.- Yes, I do.

658
00:36:19 --> 00:36:20
I may not understand whyyou have to win so badly...

659
00:36:21 --> 00:36:23
...but if it's important to you,it's important to me.

660
00:36:23 --> 00:36:24
Because I love you.

661
00:36:25 --> 00:36:28
But you suck.

662
00:36:29 --> 00:36:30
You're welcome, sweetheart.

663
00:36:31 --> 00:36:33
All right, let's get this over with.Sudden death.

664
00:36:33 --> 00:36:36
- Whoever wins this point, wins.- Okay.

665
00:36:39 --> 00:36:43
- Oh, my God. You're good.- It's like watching porn.

666
00:36:48 --> 00:36:50
And that's how it's done.

667
00:36:51 --> 00:36:54
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.That was so amazing.

668
00:36:54 --> 00:36:56
Well, when did you...?

669
00:36:56 --> 00:36:59
Hold on, I almost forgot. Loser.

670
00:37:01 --> 00:37:04
- When did you stop sucking?- I never sucked. I just didn't want you...

671
00:37:04 --> 00:37:06
...to know how good I was.- Why?

672
00:37:06 --> 00:37:08
- I don't know.- Well, this is so great.

673
00:37:08 --> 00:37:10
- Now we can enter doubles tournaments.- That's why.

674
00:37:18 --> 00:37:19
- They still looking for us?- Yeah.

675
00:37:19 --> 00:37:22
The bartender said they split upinto two search parties.

676
00:37:22 --> 00:37:24
The herbivores and the carnivores.

677
00:37:25 --> 00:37:27
You know, we, as a group,are not the coolest.

678
00:37:28 --> 00:37:29
Oh, look out.

679
00:37:34 --> 00:37:37
- I don't think they saw us.- I don't think they did.

680
00:37:43 --> 00:37:46
So I started to tell you something earlier.

681
00:37:47 --> 00:37:52
There was another reason that I realizedit was time to end it with Joey.

682
00:37:52 --> 00:37:56
I kind of realized I was startingto have feelings...

683
00:37:56 --> 00:37:58
...for someone else.

684
00:38:00 --> 00:38:02
And can I ask who?

685
00:38:03 --> 00:38:05
I think you know.

686
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
I think I know too, but I've been reallywrong about this stuff in the past, so...

687
00:38:25 --> 00:38:29
- I'm sorry, we can't.- All right. All right.

688
00:38:29 --> 00:38:32
I mean, you just went outwith my best friend, you know?

689
00:38:32 --> 00:38:35
I just think it would be a really,really bad idea.

690
00:38:38 --> 00:38:40
Or not. I mean...

691
00:39:10 --> 00:39:11
What?
