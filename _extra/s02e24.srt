I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
- How did the audition go?- Incredible.

4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
You'll never believewho the director was.

5
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
Who?

6
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
I'll give you one hint.

7
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Warren Beatty.

8
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
There's just one thingthat might be a problem.

9
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
See, I had to kiss this guy.

10
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
Because he was just so darn cute?

11
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
No, I'm up for the partof this guy...

12
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
...who the main guy kisses.

13
00:00:23 --> 00:00:28
Well, you're an actor. I sayyou just suck it up and you do it.

14
00:00:30 --> 00:00:31
Or you just do it.

15
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
I did do it.I'm a professional.

16
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
- What's the problem?- After the scene...

17
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
...Mr. Beatty comes up to me andhe says, "Good actor. Bad kisser."

18
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
Can you believe that?Me, not a good kisser.

19
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
That's like...

20
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
...like Mother Teresa,not a good mother.

21
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
Who cares what that guy thinks?

22
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
What does Warren Beattyknow about kissing?

23
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56

25
00:01:33 --> 00:01:34
What did your agent say?

26
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
This kiss thing isdefinitely a problem.

27
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again.

28
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
I gotta figure outwhat I'm doing wrong.

29
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
One of you girlscome over here and kiss me.

30
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
- Forget it.- Yeah, right.

31
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
Come on.I need your help here.

32
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
I'll do it. I've kissed him before.I can do it again.

33
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
See this? This is a friend.

34
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
Let's go.

35
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
Oh, wait. I have gum.

36
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
Good. Very good.Firm, but tender.

37
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
I'd recommend you to a friend.

38
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
Then I don't knowwhat the problem is.

39
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
Maybe you're not usedto kissing men.

40
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
Maybe you tensed up a little.

41
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
Maybe you need to work on it.

42
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
Yeah, that makes sense.

43
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
Over my dead body.

44
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
And I'll be usinghis dead body as a shield.

45
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
Come out, honey.I'm telling you, you look good.

46
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
Tell her she looks good.Tell her she looks good.

47
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
Oh, my God!

48
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
You look so good!

49
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
I cannot believe I have to walk downthe aisle in front of 200 people...

50
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
...Iooking like somethingyou drink when you're nauseous.

51
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
So don't.I don't see why we have to go.

52
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
It's your ex-fiancé's wedding.

53
00:02:59 --> 00:03:00
Because I promised Mindy I would.

54
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
Yeah, well, you promised Barryyou'd marry him.

55
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
You guys, I have to go.I'm the maid of honor.

56
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
Besides, I need to be in a roomagain with these people...

57
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
...and feel good about myself.

58
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
Someone's wearing the same clothesas last night. Get some action?

59
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
I may have.

60
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
Stud!

61
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
- What's she look like?- We haven't met.

62
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
We stayed up talking on the Internet.

63
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
Geek!

64
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
I like this girl.I seriously like this girl.

65
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
You know how I tend to geta little defended and quippy?

66
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
- Get out!- No! Please.

67
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
Well, she called me on it, okay?She said, "Cut it out, get real."

68
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
And I did.

69
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
What's that like?

70
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
It's like this. Me.

71
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
No jokes.

72
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
Stop it.You're freaking me out.

73
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
I don't like you this way.

74
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
I'll see you guys.

75
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
- Bye, Richard.- Bye-bye.

76
00:04:01 --> 00:04:02
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

77
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
I love you too.

78
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
I think my boyfriend'sever so dreamy.

79
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
I wonder whatour wedding will be like.

80
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
What are you talking about?What wedding?

81
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
You never talk about that?

82
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
No, never.

83
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
We're just living in the moment.

84
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
It is so nice for once not to gethung up on, "Where is this going?"

85
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
- Afraid to ask him?- Could not be more terrified.

86
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
I think you shouldseriously consider marriage.

87
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
Give Rachel another chance to dresslike Princess Bubble Yum.

88
00:04:38 --> 00:04:39
Where's Benny?

89
00:04:39 --> 00:04:40
There he is!

90
00:04:41 --> 00:04:42
Where's Benny?

91
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
There he is!

92
00:04:45 --> 00:04:51
Babies probably learn to talkso they can tell grownups to cut it out.

93
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
Hey, I got a question for you.

94
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Just a little thing, no pressure.

95
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
Do you ever think about the future?

96
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
Sure, I do.

97
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Yeah? Am I in it?

98
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
Honey...

99
00:05:05 --> 00:05:06
...you are it.

100
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
Oh, God.You're about to get so lucky.

101
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
Keep talking.

102
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
Sometimes I think aboutselling my practice.

103
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
We could move to France.

104
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
Make French toast.

105
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
Okay, so...

106
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
...we're in France...

107
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
...and we're making the toast.

108
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
Do you see a little bassinetin the corner?

109
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Like a hound?

110
00:05:36 --> 00:05:37
Not a basset.

111
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
A bassinet.

112
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
You really need the bassinet?

113
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
Well, I just think the babywould keep falling off the dog.

114
00:05:47 --> 00:05:51
Do you not see kids in our future?

115
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
I love children.

116
00:05:53 --> 00:05:54
I have children.

117
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
I don't wanna be 70when our kids go to college...

118
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
...and our life finally starts.

119
00:06:03 --> 00:06:04
I want you...

120
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
...now.

121
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
Well, that's great.

122
00:06:08 --> 00:06:09
We don't need to talk now.

123
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
Really, this is so, like,way, way in the future.

124
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
I'm talking hovercraftsand apes taking over the planet.

125
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
Come on, Chandler.I want this part so much.

126
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
Just one kiss.I won't tell anyone.

127
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
Joey, no means no.

128
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
I'm sorry,we don't have your sheep.

129
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
I think you look cute.

130
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
And you. You...

131
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
I could eat you.

132
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
Get away from me.I said no.

133
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
Richard's downstairs.

134
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
Richard's here?I should go say goodbye.

135
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
- Bye.- Good luck.

136
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
How's your date with cyber-chick?

137
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
What is all that?

138
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
It's a web site.It's the Guggenheim Museum.

139
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
She likes art...

140
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
...and I like funny words.

141
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
What does she mean by "H.H."?

142
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
It means we're holding hands.

143
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
Are you the cutest?

144
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
I'm afraid I might just be.

145
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
I think it's so greatthat you're into this person...

146
00:07:20 --> 00:07:25
...yet for all you know, she could be90 years old or have two heads.

147
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
It could be a guy.

148
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
It's not a guy, all right?I know her.

149
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
It could be like a big giant guy.

150
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
Man, I got this close to him,and Monica kneed me in the back.

151
00:07:39 --> 00:07:39
What's going on?

152
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
We're wondering ifChandler's girlfriend's a girl.

153
00:07:42 --> 00:07:43
Ask her how long she's gonna live.

154
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
Women live longer than men.

155
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
How do you not fall down more?

156
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
Ask her what is her methodof birth control.

157
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
All right.

158
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
"My husband is sleepingwith his secretary."

159
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
She's married?

160
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
At least we know she's a woman.

161
00:08:07 --> 00:08:08
I can't believe she's married.

162
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

163
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
This must be really tough for you.

164
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
I read this article that saysyou shouldn't throw rice at weddings.

165
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
When pigeons eat rice,it kills them.

166
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
That's why you never seepigeons in sushi bars.

167
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
- See, we're having fun.- Oh, absolutely.

168
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
I'm not thinking about that thingthat we're gonna not think about.

169
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
Neither am I.

170
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
Hey, there.Are you all right?

171
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
Yeah. But I saw the windowI crawled out of at my wedding.

172
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
And I just started thinkingI shouldn't be here. I shouldn't.

173
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
People are gonna look at me and judge meand think about the last time.

174
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
It's gonna be okay.It's a wedding.

175
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
People focus on the bride.

176
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
I know, you're right.

177
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
Alrighty.Everybody look at me. Good.

178
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...

179
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
...let's see two lines.Thank you.

180
00:08:59 --> 00:09:00
I'll see you after the thing.

181
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
- Good luck.- Thank you.

182
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
Why didn't you tell me?

183
00:09:13 --> 00:09:14
What could I do?

184
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
Stand up and shout,"Hey, your butt's showing!"

185
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
This is so humiliating.

186
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
The only thing worsewas in eighth grade...

187
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
...when I had to sing the "Copacabana"to the entire school.

188
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
Two lines into it, I freaked out.

189
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
My entire life's flashingbefore my eyes.

190
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
Rach, look, I remember that.It wasn't so bad.

191
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
Ross, would you stop!You got me. I'm dating you.

192
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Weinberg.

193
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
It's wonderfulto see you again, my dear.

194
00:09:39 --> 00:09:43
In fact, I hardly expectedto see so much.

195
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
- You told me you didn't see.- I tell you a lot of things.

196
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
Well, it's wonderful to have youup and about again, dear.

197
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
Stay well.

198
00:09:52 --> 00:09:56
That's the third time someone hassaid something like that to me today.

199
00:09:57 --> 00:09:57
Rach!

200
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
- Oh, my God, I'm married!- I know!

201
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter,hyphen, Farber.

202
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
I am so proud of you, Min.

203
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
Min.

204
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
Oh, Rach. Still here.

205
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
At our wedding, they'd packed upthe chopped liver by now.

206
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
Yeah, I love that story.

207
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
I have a question for you.

208
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
Why do people keep sayingit's good to see me up and about?

209
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
After you ran out on your wedding...

210
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
...Barry's parents told peopleyou were sort of...

211
00:10:23 --> 00:10:24
...insane.

212
00:10:25 --> 00:10:25
Insane?

213
00:10:26 --> 00:10:27
From the syphilis.

214
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
What?

215
00:10:29 --> 00:10:33
What were they gonna say?You didn't love me anymore?

216
00:10:34 --> 00:10:34
Angela?

217
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
Joey Tribbiani.

218
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

219
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
I know you're seeing that guy.I thought maybe you could bring him...

220
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
You gonna answer? That's the 10thbing-bong message she's sent.

221
00:10:56 --> 00:10:57
She asks what's wrong.

222
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
What's wrong?You're married!

223
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
That's what's wrong!

224
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
Oh, my.

225
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
She wants to meet you.

226
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
Look, Phoebe,I wanted to meet her too.

227
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
But she's married.She has a husband.

228
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
What if he's the wrong guyand you are the right guy?

229
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
You don't get thesechances all the time.

230
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
If you don't meet her, you'llkick yourself when you're 80...

231
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
...which is hard to doand you'll break a hip.

232
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
Okay. I'll do it.

233
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
Okay, great! Put on your shoesand then march out there and meet her.

234
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
No, wait! You haveto take a shower because...

235
00:11:29 --> 00:11:30
And I'll get the...

236
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
No, you have to answer her.Answer her first.

237
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
No, make some coffeebecause it's too much.

238
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
Okay, one more, please.I'm gonna get it in this time.

239
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
Okay, last chance.

240
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
Again, I'm sorry.

241
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
You know what, maybe I don'tneed to have children.

242
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
Maybe I just think I dobecause that's what society...

243
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
...and by that, I mean my mom...

244
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
...has always convinced me that I...

245
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
I do.

246
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
I have to have children.I'm sorry, I just do.

247
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
Could I have your attention?

248
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
Best man making a toast here.

249
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
Thank you.

250
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
I remember when Barry got homefrom his first date with Rachel.

251
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
You hired the same band.I can't use the same speech?

252
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
Thank you.Thank you very much.

253
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
Anyway, I wish you both...

254
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
...a wonderful life together.

255
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
And, Rachel.

256
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
What?

257
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
No, no, in all seriousness.

258
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
Not a lot of women wouldhave the guts to be here.

259
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
And even fewer who'd do itwith their asses hanging out.

260
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
I'd like to add something to that.

261
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
What are you adding?What are you adding?

262
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
Most of you don't know me.I'm Rachel's boyfriend...

263
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
Oh, dear God.

264
00:12:58 --> 00:12:58
...Ross.

265
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
And I'd just like to say that...

266
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
...it did take a lot of couragefor Rachel to come here tonight.

267
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
And just for the record...

268
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
...she did not run out on Barrybecause she had syphilis.

269
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
I'm serious.

270
00:13:14 --> 00:13:15
The reason...

271
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
...she walked out on Barryis simply that...

272
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
...she didn't love him.

273
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
Which, incidentally,worked out pretty well for me.

274
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
Cheers.

275
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
- See you in the parking lot.- No, Rach.

276
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
And once again,she is out of here!

277
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
Okay, who had 9:45?

278
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
You know what, Bar?I'm not gonna leave.

279
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
I probably should, but I'm not.

280
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
I promised myself I'd make itthrough at least one of your weddings.

281
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
Tonight, all I wanted wasto make it through this evening...

282
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
...with a little bit of graceand dignity.

283
00:14:08 --> 00:14:13
Well, I guess we can all agreethat's not gonna happen.

284
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
I guess there's nothingreally left to say...

285
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
...except...

286
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
Her name was Lola

287
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
She was a showgirl

288
00:14:30 --> 00:14:31
With yellow feath...

289
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
Feathers in her hair

290
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
And a dress cut down to there

291
00:14:36 --> 00:14:37
She would...

292
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
- Merengue- "Merengue..." Thank you, honey.

293
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
And do the cha-cha

294
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
Tony always tended bar

295
00:14:46 --> 00:14:46
At...Wait, wait!

296
00:14:47 --> 00:14:48
Everybody!

297
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
Copacabana

298
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
The hottest spot north of Havana

299
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
At the Copa

300
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
Copacabana

301
00:14:57 --> 00:15:02
In fashion at the Copa

302
00:15:07 --> 00:15:09
I'll do it.

303
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
You'll do what?

304
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
If it takes kids to be with you,then kids it is.

305
00:15:13 --> 00:15:14
Oh, my God.

306
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
If I have to,I'll do it all again.

307
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
I'll do the 4:00 feeding thing.

308
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
I'll go to the PTA meetings.

309
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
I'll coach the soccer team.

310
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
- Really?- Yeah, if I have to.

311
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Monica...

312
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
...I don't wanna lose you.

313
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
So if I have to do it all again...

314
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
...then I will.

315
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
You are the most wonderful man.

316
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
And if you hadn't have said...

317
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
..."If I have to", like, 17 times...

318
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
...then I'd be saying,"Okay, let's do it."

319
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
But you're not.

320
00:15:53 --> 00:15:58
Oh, my God. I can't believewhat I'm getting ready to say.

321
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
I wanna have a baby.

322
00:16:04 --> 00:16:09
But I don't want to have one withsomeone who doesn't really want one.

323
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
God.

324
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
I love you.

325
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
I know you do.

326
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
Me too.

327
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
So what now?

328
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
I guess we just...

329
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
...keep dancing.

330
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
Where is she?Where is she?

331
00:16:51 --> 00:16:52
Oh, hey, I have a question.

332
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
Where is she?

333
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
Relax, Chandler.She'll be here.

334
00:16:58 --> 00:16:59
Oh, that's her.

335
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
Yeah, because life's just that kind.

336
00:17:03 --> 00:17:04
You gotta stopstaring at the door...

337
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
...like a watched pot.

338
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
If you keep looking at it,the door's never gonna boil.

339
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
I think what you have to dois try not to...

340
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
Oh, my God.

341
00:17:20 --> 00:17:21
Oh...

342
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
...my...

343
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
...God.

344
00:17:31 --> 00:17:32
Oh...

345
00:17:32 --> 00:17:33
...my...

346
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
...God.

347
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
All right.

348
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
I've felt guilty becauseI wanna be a good friend.

349
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
And damn it, I am a good friend.So shut up and close your eyes.

350
00:17:54 --> 00:17:55
You are a good friend.

351
00:17:55 --> 00:17:58
The audition's over,and I didn't get it.

352
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
But that was a hell of a kiss.

353
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
