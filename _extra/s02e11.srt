I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:01 --> 00:00:04
Okay, here's his diaper bag...

4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
...and his Mr. Winky.

5
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
And...

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
...him. Hi!

7
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
- How did everything go?- Great!

8
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
There was a projectile...

9
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
...throwing up incident,but he started it.

10
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
We've gotta go.

11
00:00:20 --> 00:00:21
Oh, right.

12
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
I've got some news.It's about us.

13
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
You and me?

14
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
No. Susan and me.

15
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
The other "us".

16
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
We're getting married.

17
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
As in, "I now pronounce youwife and wife" married?

18
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
We'd like you to come.We understand if you don't want to.

19
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
Why wouldn't I want to come?I had fun at the first wedding.

20
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
I just thought that...

21
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
Why shouldn't I be happy for you?What would it say about me...

22
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
...if I couldn't revelin your joy?

23
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
And I'm reveling, baby!Believe me!

24
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
Is your finger caught in that chair?

25
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
Want us to go?

28
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
This is cool.You're actually on television.

29
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
I know.It really hit me last night.

30
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
I'm on "Days of our Lives".

31
00:01:51 --> 00:01:56
Then I started thinking about us,and how these are the days of our lives.

32
00:01:57 --> 00:01:57
Yes!

33
00:01:58 --> 00:01:58
What?

34
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
Carol and Susan's catererhad a bike accident...

35
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
...and she's in afull-body cast.

36
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
They asked me, which is coolsince I've never catered...

37
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
...and I need the money.Is this a problem?

38
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
- Would it matter?- You're so great!

39
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
Thank you!

40
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
- You're really not going?- I'm really not.

41
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
They already live together.Why do they need to get married?

42
00:02:19 --> 00:02:20
They love each other.

43
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
They wanna celebrate that lovewith the people close to them.

44
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
If you wanna callthat a reason.

45
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
man in the living room?

46
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
in the living room?

47
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Hi, neighbor.

48
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
- I thought you were over this.- That has nothing to do with it.

49
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
If she were marrying a guy,you wouldn't expect me to go.

50
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
If she were marrying a guy,she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

51
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
Did I miss it?

52
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
No, I'm on right after this guyshoots himself.

53
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
She's pretty.

54
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
And she's really nice.

55
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
She taught me abouthow to work with the cameras...

56
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
...and smell-the-fart acting.

57
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
- I'm sorry, what?- Excuse me?

58
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
You got so many linesto learn so fast that sometimes...

59
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
...you need a minuteto remember your next one.

60
00:03:09 --> 00:03:10
So while you're thinking...

61
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
...you take this big pausewhere you look all intense.

62
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
Like this...

63
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
Here's my scene!Here's my scene!

64
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
Mrs. Wallace?

65
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
your sister's neurosurgeon.

66
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Is she going to be all right?

67
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
is much more dire than we'd expected.

68
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
Your sister's suffering from a...

69
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
... subcranial hematoma.

70
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
discuss this further over coffee.

71
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
Nice!

72
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
For a minute, I thought you wereactually smelling something.

73
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
- Do it again!- All right!

74
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
- That was so good!- Do it again.

75
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
"Damn it, Braverman!It's right there on the chart!"

76
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
I gotta get to work.I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

77
00:04:08 --> 00:04:09
No, that's me.

78
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
Oh, right.

79
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Oh, thanks. Couldn't...

80
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
Is everything okay?

81
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
No.

82
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
One of my clients diedon the massage table today.

83
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
Oh, my God!

84
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
That's a little more relaxedthan you want them to get.

85
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
She was, you know,82 years old...

86
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
...and her name wasMrs. Adelman.

87
00:04:36 --> 00:04:36
Oh, honey.

88
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
It's just so strange. You know...

89
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
...she probably woke upthis morning and thought...

90
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
...I'll have some breakfast,take a walk, then have my massage.

91
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
Little did she know God thought,"Okay, but that's it."

92
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Oh, but the weirdest things was...

93
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
...I was cleansing her aurawhen it happened.

94
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
And when her spiritleft her body...

95
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
...I don't think it went very far.

96
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
What do you mean?

97
00:05:01 --> 00:05:05
I think it went into me.

98
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
This is so hard.

99
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
I can't decidebetween lamb or duck.

100
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
Well, lambs are scarier.

101
00:05:15 --> 00:05:19
Silence of the Ducks.

102
00:05:19 --> 00:05:20
Okay, who ordered what?

103
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
I had the half-drunk cappuccinowith the lipstick on the rim.

104
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
And this with the cigarettebutt in it, is that decaf?

105
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
Oh, God.

106
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
You're so uptightabout your mom coming.

107
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
I know. I just don't wanther to think that because...

108
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
...I didn't marry Barrymy life is crap.

109
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
Talk about crap, justlisten to Stella Neidman...

110
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
...tell her story about Rod Steigerfor the hundredth time.

111
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
Pheebs? How long do you thinkthis lady will be with us?

112
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
I don't know. She obviouslyhas some unfinished business.

113
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
Sit up!

114
00:05:54 --> 00:05:55
There she is!

115
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
- Mom!- Hey, sweetie!

116
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
So this is where you work!

117
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
Oh, it's wonderful!

118
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
Is it a living room?Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

119
00:06:09 --> 00:06:10
I guess that's the fun.

120
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
Pretty much.Here, meet my friends.

121
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
Monica! You look gorgeous!

122
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
Oh, my! The last time I saw you,it was eat or be eaten.

123
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
This is Joey.

124
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
This is Phoebe.

125
00:06:21 --> 00:06:22
This is Chandler.

126
00:06:23 --> 00:06:23
You remember Ross?

127
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
Oh, hello, Ross.

128
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
Mrs. Greene.

129
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
What do you think of mydaughter, in the apron...

130
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
...with the big job!

131
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
Oh, Mom!

132
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
If you didn't pour the coffee,no one would have anything to drink.

133
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

134
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
This is just so exciting!You know, I never worked.

135
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
I went from my father's houseto the sorority house...

136
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
...to my husband's house.I am just so proud of you!

137
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
Really?

138
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
I know who you remind me of.

139
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
Evelyn Durmer.

140
00:06:55 --> 00:07:00
That's before the lousy face-lift.Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

141
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Pheebs? Who's Evelyn Durmer?

142
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
I don't know.Who's Soupy Sales?

143
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
Oh, my God!

144
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
There's an unattractivenude man playing the cello.

145
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
Just be glad he's not playinga smaller instrument.

146
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
You have some life here, sweetie!

147
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
Mom, I realize you were upsetwhen I didn't marry Barry...

148
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
...and get the house in the suburbswith all the security.

149
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
This is justso much better for me.

150
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
I know.You didn't love Barry, honey.

151
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
And I've never seen you this happy.

152
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
I look at you and I think,"This is what I want."

153
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
For me.

154
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
Well, not just for you.

155
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
What do you mean?

156
00:07:45 --> 00:07:50
I'm consideringleaving your father.

157
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
All right, tell meif this is too cute.

158
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
Lesbian wedding...chicken breasts.

159
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
Oh, God.I think I'm gonna be sick.

160
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
What? It's not like I'm puttinglittle nipples on them.

161
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
- You had no idea?- None.

162
00:08:09 --> 00:08:10
They didn't fight?

163
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
No, they didn't eventalk to each other.

164
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
How was I suppose to knowthey were having problems?

165
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
You know, in my day,divorce was not an option.

166
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
Hey, look who's up!

167
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
I just can't believethis is happening!

168
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
When I was little,all parents got divorced.

169
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
I figured as an adult,I wouldn't have to worry about it.

170
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
Can't you look at thisas flattering?

171
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
She just wants to be like you.

172
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
Well, couldn't she have justcopied my haircut?

173
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
When my parents divorced,they sent me to a shrink...

174
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
...and she told methat kids blame themselves.

175
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
But in your case,it's actually kind of true.

176
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Oh, that's him.

177
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
Damn! My mail-ordergrandfather hasn't come yet.

178
00:08:52 --> 00:08:53
- Phoebe?- Hi, Mr. Adelman.

179
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
- Nice to see you.- Thanks for coming.

180
00:08:55 --> 00:08:59
That's okay. Although you didcut into my busy day of sitting.

181
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
Do you wanna sit?

182
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
No, I spent most of my morningtrying to stand up.

183
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
What can I dofor you, my dear?

184
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
Okay, I don't know howto say this, but...

185
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
I think when your wife's spiritleft her body...

186
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
...it kind of stuck around...

187
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
...in me.

188
00:09:16 --> 00:09:17
You're sayingmy wife is in you?

189
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
Yeah. You don't have tobelieve me, but...

190
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
...can you think ofany unfinished business she had?

191
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
Any reason to hang around?

192
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
I don't know what to say.

193
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
All I can think of is that...

194
00:09:28 --> 00:09:32
...she used to say that before she died,she wanted to see everything.

195
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
- Everything?- Everything.

196
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
That's a lot of stuff.

197
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
Oh, wait, I...

198
00:09:36 --> 00:09:41
I remember she also said she wantedto sleep with me one last time.

199
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
I'm sorry.There's laughing in my head.

200
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
Worth a shot, huh?

201
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
Look at this!

202
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
These are all Halloween,three years ago.

203
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
Oh, and look, here's Barry.

204
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
He came straightfrom the office?

205
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
Oh, no.That was his costume.

206
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
See, he's actually an orthodontist,but he came as a regular dentist.

207
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
You guys?

208
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
Remember when I saidthat I don't need your help?

209
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
Actually, I think you said...

210
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
..."Don't touch thatand get out of my kitchen."

211
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
Really? Weird.Anyway...

212
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
I planned really well.I planned and planned.

213
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
I just didn't planenough time to do it.

214
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
- You want some help?- Lf you want.

215
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
What a day!

216
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
I took her everywhere.

217
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
The Museum of Modern Art,Rockefeller Center...

218
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
...the Statue of Liberty.

219
00:10:43 --> 00:10:44
She's still with you?

220
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
Yes. I guess she hasn'tseen everything yet.

221
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
Be right back. She has to goto the bathroom again.

222
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
Such a pretty face!

223
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
Oh, this is so much fun!Just the girls!

224
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
Do you know what we should do?Does anybody have any marijuana?

225
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
God!

226
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
Look, no one's smoking potaround all this food.

227
00:11:09 --> 00:11:10
Well, that's fine.

228
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
I never did it.I just thought I might.

229
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
What's new in sex?

230
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
What's new in sex?

231
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
The only man I've been withis your father.

232
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.I don't hear anything.

233
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
This is no offense to your dad,but I was thinking...

234
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
...there might be more.

235
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
You know what? I cannothave this conversation with you.

236
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
All right.

237
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
You come here and drop this bomb on mebefore you even tell Daddy.

238
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
Do you want my blessing?Want me to talk you out of it?

239
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
Then what do you want?

240
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
I guess I figuredyou would understand.

241
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
Why on earthwould I understand this?

242
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

243
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
But I married mine.

244
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
We're in trouble. We've only got12 hours and 36 minutes left.

245
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
Move, move, move!

246
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
I feel like you shouldhave German subtitles.

247
00:12:03 --> 00:12:04
Joey, speed it up!

248
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
I'm sorry! It's the pigs!They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

249
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
How did this happen?I thought you had this planned out.

250
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
Do you want me to cry?

251
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
Is that what you want?

252
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
Do you wanna see me cry?

253
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
Sir, no, sir!

254
00:12:21 --> 00:12:22
All right, you!

255
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
No. Look, I told you,I am not a part of this thing.

256
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
Look, Ross. I know you have issues withCarol and Susan, and I feel for you.

257
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
But if you don't help,I'm gonna take those hot dogs...

258
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
...and create an appetizercalled "Pigs In Ross".

259
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
All right, ball a melon!

260
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
How come I'm stuck dicingwhen he gets to ball a melon?

261
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
- How's it going?- Great! Right on schedule.

262
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
Got my little happy helpers.

263
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
That's fine. Whatever.

264
00:12:51 --> 00:12:52
What's wrong?

265
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
Nothing.

266
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
Okay, everything.I think we're calling off the wedding.

267
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
You're still gonna pay me, right?

268
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Or something a little less selfish.

269
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
What's the matter?What happened?

270
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
My parents called to saythey weren't coming.

271
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
I knew they werehaving trouble with this, but...

272
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
...they're my parents.They're supposed to give me away.

273
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
Susan and I fought becauseI said maybe we should call it off.

274
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
She said, "This isn't for them.It's for us."

275
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
And if I couldn't see that,we should cancel the wedding.

276
00:13:23 --> 00:13:26
I don't know what to do.

277
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,but I think Susan's right.

278
00:13:30 --> 00:13:31
You do?

279
00:13:31 --> 00:13:36
Do you love her? And don't betoo emphatic about this.

280
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
Of course I do.

281
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
Well then, that's it.

282
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
If George and Adelaide can'taccept that, then the hell with them.

283
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
If my parents didn't want meto marry you...

284
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
...no way that would'vestopped me.

285
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
Look, this is your wedding.

286
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
Do it.

287
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56
You're right.Of course you're right.

288
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
So we're back on?

289
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
We're back on.

290
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
You heard the woman!Peel! Chop! Devil!

291
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
Can't believeI lost two minutes!

292
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
It just seems so futile.

293
00:14:15 --> 00:14:19
You know?All these women, and nothing!

294
00:14:20 --> 00:14:23
I feel like Supermanwithout my powers, you know?

295
00:14:23 --> 00:14:27
I have the cape,and yet I cannot fly.

296
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
Well, now you understandhow I feel every single day.

297
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
The world is my lesbian wedding.

298
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
Butterscotch?

299
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
No one?

300
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
All right,you'll be sorry later.

301
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
- Thank you.- Anytime.

302
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
Ross.

303
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Nothing makes God happier...

304
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
...than when two people, any two people,come together in love.

305
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
Friends, family,we're gathered here today...

306
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
...to join Carol and Susanin holy matrimony.

307
00:15:35 --> 00:15:36
Oh, my God!

308
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
Now I've seen everything!

309
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
She's gone!

310
00:15:42 --> 00:15:43
She's gone!

311
00:15:43 --> 00:15:44
She's gone.

312
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
Go ahead, get married.Go, go!

313
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
Strangers in the night

314
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
Exchanging glances

315
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
Wondering in the night

316
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
Would you look at them?

317
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
Yeah. Can't help but.

318
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
How's that pig-in-the-blanketworking out for you?

319
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
I wrapped those bad boys.

320
00:16:08 --> 00:16:09
I miss Rose.

321
00:16:09 --> 00:16:09
Oh, yeah?

322
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
I know it's kind of weird, butshe was a big part of my life...

323
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
I don't know, I feel alone.

324
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
You know, I couldn't helpoverhearing what you just said.

325
00:16:20 --> 00:16:24
I think it's time you forget about Rose,move on with your life.

326
00:16:24 --> 00:16:25
How about we get you a drink?

327
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
Okay. So nice!

328
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
I shouldn't even bothercoming up with a line, right?

329
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
Hey, Mom, having fun?

330
00:16:40 --> 00:16:44
Am I! I just dancedwith a wonderfully large woman.

331
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
And three other girlsmade eyes at me over at the buffet.

332
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
I'm not sayingit's something I wanna pursue...

333
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
...but it's nice to knowI have options.

334
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
There's more alcohol, right?

335
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
How you doing?

336
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
You did a good thing today.

337
00:17:09 --> 00:17:10
You wanna dance?

338
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
No, that's fine.

339
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
Come on.

340
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
I'll let you lead.

341
00:17:30 --> 00:17:31
Look, penis, schmenis!

342
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
Okay? We're all people.

343
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
Which one of us is gonna bethe first one to get married?

344
00:17:45 --> 00:17:46
Mon, I was married.

345
00:17:46 --> 00:17:48
- Yeah, me too, technically.- I had a wedding.

346
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
Just trying tostart a discussion.

347
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
Which one do you thinkwill be the last to get married?

348
00:17:58 --> 00:17:59
Isn't Ben in this?

349
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
Of course!

350
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
Absolutely.
