1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:05
Chandler! Chandler!

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
I saw what you were doingin the window!

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
I saw what you're doing to my sister!Get out here!

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
Listen, we had a good run.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
What was it?Four, five months?

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
That's more than most peoplehave in a lifetime. Goodbye.

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
- What are you doing?- I am going on the lam.

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
Come on, Chandler.I can handle Ross.

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
Hold on!

10
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
Hey, Ross.What's up, bro?

11
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
What the hell are you doing?

12
00:00:36 --> 00:00:36
What's going on?

13
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
I think Ross knowsabout me and Monica.

14
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
Dude, he's right there.

15
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
I thought you were my best friend!This is my sister!

16
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
My best friend and my sister!I cannot believe this!

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
We're not just messing around.I love her.

18
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
I'm in love with her.

19
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
I'm so sorry that youhad to find out this way.

20
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
I'm sorry, but it's true.I love him too.

21
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
My best friend and my sister!

22
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
I cannot believe this!

23
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
You guys want to probablyget some hugs in too. Big news!

24
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
We've actually known for a while.

25
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
What? You guys knew?

26
00:01:26 --> 00:01:27
You all knew andyou didn't tell me?

27
00:01:28 --> 00:01:33
We were worried about you. We didn'tknow how you were going to react.

28
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
You were worried about me?

29
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
You didn't know how I'd react?

30
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
Okay. All right.

31
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
Let's clear out of here and letthese love birds get back to business.

32
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
I'm just talking here.He's the one doing your sister.

33
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
The One with the Girl Who Hits Joey

34
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
You know what I just realized?

35
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
If you guys have kids...

36
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
We're having kids?

37
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
I call godfather!

38
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
You can't just call godfather.

39
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
Shouldn't her brother be godfather?

40
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
Sure. If you cared enoughto call it first.

41
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
- You're a few steps ahead of us.- Big zero gravity moon steps.

42
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
I just thought ofthe greatest wedding gift.

43
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
I'll go in on that with you.I couldn't decide.

44
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
Hey, Katie.

45
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
This is Katie.

46
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
You ready to go?

47
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
I'll run to the bathroom.

48
00:02:57 --> 00:02:58
Where's lunch?

49
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
I was thinking Chinese food.

50
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
I love Chinese!

51
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
How did you know I love Chinese?

52
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
She is so cute.

53
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
You could fit herin your pocket.

54
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
I don't know. I like her a lot,and she's really nice, but...

55
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
But what?

56
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
She keeps punching me.

57
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
In the cute little,sweet way she just did?

58
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
It's a lot harder than it looks.

59
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
She's hurting me.

60
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
I know what you need.You need a bodyguard.

61
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
What is Ben doing after preschool?

62
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
Joey is having a problem.A little girl is beating him up.

63
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
Joey, come here.

64
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
Honey, I know. This must bereally difficult for you, and...

65
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

66
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
I brought you some housewarming gifts.

67
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
Salt, so your life always has flavor.

68
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
Bread, so you never go hungry.

69
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
And a scented candle for the bathroom.

70
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
Because, well, you know.

71
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
Thanks. Thanks.And thanks, I guess.

72
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
Welcome. I'm Steve Cera,President of the tenants' committee.

73
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
Ross Geller.And this is my friend Phoebe.

74
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
Mr. President.

75
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
I came to talk to youabout Howard.

76
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
He is the handymanwho's retiring next week.

77
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
Everyone who lives here is kicking in$100 as a kind of a thank you.

78
00:04:27 --> 00:04:28
That's nice.

79
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
Want to give me a check?

80
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Not now. You canslip it under my door.

81
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
No, it's not that.

82
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
I just moved in.

83
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
Well, the guy's worked herefor 25 years.

84
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
Yes, but I've lived herefor 25 minutes.

85
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
Okay, I get it.

86
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
Wait! Look, I'm sorry, it's justI've never even met Howard.

87
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
I mean, I don't know Howard.

88
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Howard's the handyman.

89
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
Yes, but to me he's just "man".

90
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

91
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
Welcome to the building.

92
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
Can you believe that guy?

93
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
I really like his glasses.

94
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
So then President Stevetold everyone I was a cheapskate...

95
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
...and now the whole building hates me.

96
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
A little kid spit on my knee.

97
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
You know what?

98
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
I'll throw a party.For everyone in the building.

99
00:05:27 --> 00:05:31
And I'll sit them all down andexplain that I am not a bad guy.

100
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
I am not a cheap guy.I'm just a guy...

101
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
...who stands upfor what he believes in.

102
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
A man with principles.

103
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Sounds like a fun party.

104
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
If you want them to like you,why don't you just pay the $100?

105
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
The party will cost you more.

106
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
That doesn't matter!

107
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
It's my principles!We're talking about my principles!

108
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
I thought it was aboutyour neighbors liking you.

109
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
They'll like me oncethey come to my awesome par-tay.

110
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
I gotta get some name tags.

111
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
And that crazy party animalwill be your brother-in-law.

112
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
Very funny.But don't say that to Monica.

113
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
Don't put any ideas in her head.

114
00:06:10 --> 00:06:14
You do realize that those ideasare probably already in Monica's head?

115
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
Why?

116
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
Well, because she loves youand because you love her.

117
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
Yeah, so? What'sthat supposed to mean?

118
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
Don't freak out! I'm telling yousomething you already know.

119
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
She left Richard becausehe didn't want to have babies.

120
00:06:28 --> 00:06:33
And she is a woman. And she'salmost 30. And, you know, it's Monica.

121
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
I don't see it that way.I see two Monicas:

122
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
My friend who lives acrossthe hall and wants a lot of babies.

123
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
And the new Monicawho I started to date.

124
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
Now, who is to say what she wants?

125
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
I'm right.

126
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Am I right?

127
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
You're right.

128
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
You're absolutely right.That makes everything different.

129
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
It's not different, is it?

130
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
Not unless "different"means the same.

131
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
You were so funny with that waiter.You're such a nut!

132
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
You know, breadstick fangsare always funny.

133
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
No, you make them funny.You're the funny one!

134
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
Look, Katie.Listen, we need to talk, okay?

135
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
Look, I like you.I really do. I like you a lot.

136
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
But sometimes when youplayfully punch me like that...

137
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
...it feels like I'm being hitwith a very tiny but a very real bat!

138
00:07:30 --> 00:07:31
Like I could hurt you.

139
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
Are you making fun of my size?

140
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
Don't make fun of mebecause of my size!

141
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
Isn't this great?

142
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
Couldn't you juststay like this forever?

143
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
Couldn't you just stay here forever?

144
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
Yeah, here, somewhere else.You know, wherever.

145
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
Are you okay?

146
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
I'm cool.

147
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
Casual.

148
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
What are you doing?

149
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
Just hanging out. Having funwith the girl that I'm seeing casually.

150
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
Man, I knew it!I knew you'd do this.

151
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
Get all freaked out becauseeverybody was joking about marriage!

152
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
Well, you do wantall that stuff, right?

153
00:08:14 --> 00:08:15
You know what I want?

154
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
Yes! You want babies!You have baby fever!

155
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
I do not have baby fever!

156
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
You're obsessedwith babies and marriage...

157
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
...and everything that'srelated to babies and marriage.

158
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
Why don't we turn the heatdown on this pressure cooker!

159
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
Have you lost your mind?

160
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
This isn't about me. This is aboutyou and your weird commitment crap!

161
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
I know you. I know the thoughtsthat you have in your head.

162
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
You don't know everything.

163
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
Did you know I'm going outwith Rachel tonight instead of you?

164
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
And that the only baby here is you?

165
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
Did you know I can't evenlook at you now?

166
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
I did not know that.

167
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
It'll be okay, right?She won't leave me. This is fixable.

168
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
- Yeah, sure.- Absolutely.

169
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
By me?

170
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
Unless you make some big gesture.

171
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
Big, though.

172
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
The missus!

173
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
Gunther, can I get a coffee?

174
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
To go.

175
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
I still don't want to talk to you.

176
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
Tell me how to make things right.

177
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
That's what we do.

178
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
I mess up, you tell mehow to fix it and I do.

179
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
And then you think I'm cute again.

180
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
I'm really tired of beingyour relationship tutor.

181
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
Figure this out for yourself.

182
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
If you're afraidof a real relationship...

183
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
...then don't be in one.

184
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
Howard! Howard! Howard!

185
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
Hi, Ross!

186
00:10:22 --> 00:10:23
What are you doing here?

187
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
I thought this was your party,and it's a party for Howard.

188
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
He's the sweetest little man.

189
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
See you, Phoebe.And thanks for chipping in.

190
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Oh, sure.

191
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
You chipped in?

192
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
Yeah, $100.

193
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
I can't believe you gave him money.

194
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
I thought you agreed it was unreasonablethat they asked me for that money.

195
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
But they didn't ask me.

196
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
I'm just the exotic, generous stranger.That's always fun to be.

197
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
But you're making me look bad.

198
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
No, I'm not! If anything,I'm making you look better.

199
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
They'll see youtalking to me. I'm a hit.

200
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
Hey, Pheebs!

201
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
Hey, Ross.

202
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
Maybe you two couldswitch apartments.

203
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
Because Phoebe is moreour kind of people.

204
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
Think about it.

205
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
Okay, my bad.

206
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
You look big.

207
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
Thanks, I've been working out.

208
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
Listen, is it obviousI'm wearing six sweaters?

209
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
But it's not obvious why.

210
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
I'm breaking up with Katie,so I put on some extra padding.

211
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
If she hits me when she is happy,can you imagine how hard she'll hit...

212
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
...when I take away the Joey love?

213
00:11:45 --> 00:11:46
Hey, cute jacket.

214
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
Thanks.

215
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
- That's so sweet!- Ouch!

216
00:11:53 --> 00:11:58
Did Joey tell you to say that?You guys are too much!

217
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
You know what?I got to tell you...

218
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
...I think you're the onethat is too much.

219
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
Joey has the nicest friends.

220
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
And the nicest girlfriend.

221
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
You're so sweet!

222
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
You're so sweet!

223
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
She just kicked me.

224
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
Aren't you going to do something?

225
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
Do something or I'll walkout that door right now.

226
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
Are you going to?

227
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
This is a disaster.Can't I please just go?

228
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
I'm talking you up to people.

229
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
Give it some time, relax.Get something to eat.

230
00:13:02 --> 00:13:03
What did you tell them about me?

231
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
I told them about you and Emily.Trying to get some sympathy.

232
00:13:06 --> 00:13:09
But you came off as the bad guy.

233
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
I told it wrong.

234
00:13:12 --> 00:13:17
We should talk about that, becauseI don't understand what happened there.

235
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
This cake is really good!

236
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
Things are looking up.

237
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
Oh, my God!Someone cut Howard's cake!

238
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
Who would do a thing like that?

239
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
3-B.

240
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
You got your free food.You ruined everyone's fun.

241
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
Isn't it time you went home?

242
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
Go back to 3-B, 3-B.

243
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
Everyone, calm down!I have something that I'd like to say.

244
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
Who here likes Ross?

245
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
Of course you don't like him.

246
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
He didn't give you any money.

247
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
He raised his own handwhen I asked, "Who likes Ross?"

248
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
And he's wearing two name tags.

249
00:14:06 --> 00:14:11
I'll be honest. When I first met Ross,I didn't like him at all.

250
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
Once I got to know him,I saw that he is really sweet...

251
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
...and caring and very generous.

252
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
All I'm saying is don't judgeRoss before you get to know him.

253
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
You know, I like all of you guys now.But when I first met you, you know?

254
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.

255
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
Lola?

256
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
Mind-numbingly stupid.

257
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
You guys. Gold digger,cradle-robbing perv.

258
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
So I think you all know what I mean.

259
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
Obviously, I didn't thinkthey would throw things.

260
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
I thought if I kept insulting themyou'd defend them.

261
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
Then you'd look like the hero.

262
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
See, I did not get that.

263
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
Where's Monica? I needto talk to her, it's urgent.

264
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
I'm Monica.

265
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

266
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
I've been thinking...

267
00:15:09 --> 00:15:13
...about us. A lot of "us" thinking.

268
00:15:13 --> 00:15:17
I guess there'sonly one way to do this.

269
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
What are you doing?

270
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
Don't do it.

271
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
Will you marry me?

272
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
What a bad idea.

273
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
I can't not look at it.

274
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
Why are you doing this?

275
00:15:34 --> 00:15:35
I don't know.

276
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

277
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

278
00:15:43 --> 00:15:47
Do you think the best reasonto get married is because you're sorry?

279
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
The best reason is pregnancy.

280
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
Sorry is fourth, behind being readyand actually wanting to get married.

281
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
Will you be my wife?

282
00:16:00 --> 00:16:05
I want you to take a minute and thinkabout how ridiculous this sounds.

283
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
I'm kind of wishingeveryone wasn't here now.

284
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
None of that came from me.

285
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
I never said I wanted to have babiesand get married!

286
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
I was really confused.Then I talked to these guys.

287
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
Who? Two divorces and Joey?

288
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
She's right, you know?

289
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!

290
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
You know when I saidthat I want you...

291
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
...to deal with relationship stuffall on your own?

292
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
You're not ready.

293
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
I didn't think I was!

294
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Oh, my God.

295
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
What would you have doneif I had said yes?

296
00:16:44 --> 00:16:45
I would've been happy because...

297
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
...I would spend the rest ofmy life with the woman I love.

298
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
Or you would have seena Chandler-shaped hole in that door.

299
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
Will you pass that knife?

300
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
No, I will not.

301
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
You don't have to be mean about it.

302
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
You're right. I'm sorry.Will you marry me?

303
00:17:08 --> 00:17:12
I was going to ask you to marry mebecause I didn't say hello to you.

304
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
Or ask them to move in with you.But I'm not sure. Chandler?

305
00:17:16 --> 00:17:17
How long is this going to go on?

306
00:17:18 --> 00:17:19
I think the length of teasing...

307
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
...is directly related to how insaneyou were. So, a long time.

308
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
This is fun!

309
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
Remember that"we were on a break" thing?

310
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
I'm sorry.Will you marry me?

311
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
That's not funny.
