1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
I'm getting my nails done!

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
You said it was going to be fun.

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Which it kind of is.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
You said there would be guys.There are no guys.

5
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
There's one right over there.

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
That's a mailman!

7
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
That's our mailman!

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
Don't worry. This doesn'tmake you any less of a guy.

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
That does.

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
What am I sitting on?

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
What was this woman scratchingwhen this broke off?

12
00:00:35 --> 00:00:36
You know who had nails like that?

13
00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
Oh...

14
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
...my...

15
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
...God!

16
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
The One with All the Rugby

17
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
Joey, let me ask you a question.

18
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
What does this light switch do?

19
00:01:25 --> 00:01:26
Nothing.

20
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
Did it drive you crazyto not know?

21
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
I know what it did.Nothing.

22
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
They put it there for something.How can you not care?

23
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
Like this.

24
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
Here's another question.

25
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
What does the silverknob on the toilet do?

26
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
It flushes it.

27
00:01:44 --> 00:01:48
Since you know, when you come over,would you use it?

28
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
Guess who we saw today?

29
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
- Janice!- Is this amazing?

30
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
- How have you been?- Well, I'm divorced.

31
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
I'm riding the alimony pony.

32
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
And there it is.

33
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
I just came up to say "hi".

34
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
Sweetie, I'll see you later.

35
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
I'll see you tonight.

36
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
I can't stand the woman!

37
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
What?I thought you were crazy about her!

38
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
But you know all those annoyingthings she did before?

39
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
Her voice, her laughand her personality?

40
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
They're all back!

41
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
And she's picked up, like,nine new ones!

42
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
Why'd you bring her here?There's people here!

43
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Don't worry.I'm taking care of it.

44
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
You are not!You never break up with her.

45
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
I don't have to break up.

46
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
We're not involved.I'll do a preemptive strike.

47
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
I'll end it with herbefore it starts.

48
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
My ass is, like, frozen!

49
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
Try sticking it in the freezerfor 20 minutes.

50
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
I'm telling you!

51
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
I can't believeyou walk alone here at night.

52
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
- You hear such stories about New York.- It's not that bad.

53
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
I mean, I, for one,feel perfectly safe.

54
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
Help! Help!

55
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
No, no, Ross!

56
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
These are friends from home.

57
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
Liam, Devon, this is Ross.

58
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
- Hi, mate.- How are you, man?

59
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
That was a good one, huh?"Help! Help!"

60
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
How are you?

61
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
I've been meaning to ring youever since I arrived...

62
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
...but I've been rather busy.

63
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
We have not seen each othersince that U2 concert.

64
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
Oh, my God. You're right.

65
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
Actually, the last time we saweach other was the next morning.

66
00:03:43 --> 00:03:44
Oh, Liam!

67
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
Oh, Liam.

68
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
So were you guys playing soccer?

69
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
Or should I call it "football"?

70
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
We were playing rugby.

71
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
In fact, we're playing tomorrow.You're welcome to play.

72
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
Ross play rugby?I don't think so.

73
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
What's so funny?

74
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
Well, you're American, to start with.You don't have rugby here.

75
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
Well, we didn't have freedomhere until 1776 either, so...

76
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
So, good!We'll see you at the park at two.

77
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Cheers!

78
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
Oh, boy! I just love to sing.

79
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
Yes, I know you do.

80
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
The reason people complained...

81
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
...was because they paid to hearthe actor sing "Old Man River".

82
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
Look at us!

83
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
Who would've thought Cupid hada station at 14th Street Nails?

84
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
Okay, we have to talk.

85
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
I'm just getting out ofa very serious relationship.

86
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
I know. And I'm justgetting out of a marriage.

87
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
Talk about "meant to be".

88
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Right. But I think thisis happening too soon.

89
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
Oh, too soon, too schmoon!

90
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Face it, I'm not letting youget away this time.

91
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
I hear you!

92
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
But...

93
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
...unfortunately...

94
00:05:05 --> 00:05:06
...my company...

95
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
...is transferring me overseas.

96
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
Oh, no!

97
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Where to?

98
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
To Paris?

99
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
No, not Paris.

100
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
To London? Rome? Vienna?

101
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
Barcelona?

102
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
Could you just stop talkingfor a second?

103
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
Yemen.

104
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
That's right. Yes!I'm being transferred to Yemen!

105
00:05:30 --> 00:05:30
When?

106
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
I don't know exactly.

107
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
Well, I will just have tosoak up every ounce...

108
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
...of Chandler Bing untilthat moment comes.

109
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

110
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
- Done?- Yep!

111
00:05:50 --> 00:05:51
What's up?

112
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
This switch isdriving me crazy.

113
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
I turned it offand checked every outlet.

114
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
Four don't work, which meansone is controlled by the switch.

115
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
So I plugged things in the outletsthat make noise.

116
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
That way, when I turn it on,I just follow the noise.

117
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
Bet I stopped listening first.

118
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
You know, you also couldhave used lamps...

119
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
...and followed the light.

120
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
Yeah, well, I'm using noise.

121
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
So, everybody ready?

122
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
Here we go!

123
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
Something. I hear something.Where is it?

124
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
It's coming from Joey!

125
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
Oh, my God! That's so freaky!Turn him off!

126
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Could we put on the news?It might be raining.

127
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
Hold on. I'm watchingthis rugby thing on ESPN.

128
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
I'm man enough to play this sport!

129
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
You're not even man enough toget the channel that carries the sport.

130
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
Hey there, Ross!

131
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
Janice.

132
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
You know, you really didn'thave to help me pack.

133
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
When you said all you'd be doingbefore you leave is packing...

134
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
...you really didn'tleave me much choice.

135
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
I thought I did,but I guess I did not.

136
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
What's going on?

137
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
I'm packing, you know,because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

138
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
Thanks for telling me!

139
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
I'm going to be pretend-movingto Yemen. To get rid of her.

140
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
Good one!

141
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
Yemen! That actually soundslike a real country!

142
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
I'll show you how to roll yourunderwear and stuff it in your shoes.

143
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
It's a space-saver.

144
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
I do that becauseit makes me look taller.

145
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
Come on!

146
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
- Joey, trade lives with me.- Nope.

147
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
Ross, I can't believeyou said you'd play.

148
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
This is brutal!

149
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
I can handle it.

150
00:07:57 --> 00:08:01
Please, Ross. You got hurtplaying badminton with my dad.

151
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
That's because your mom's dogkept looking at me.

152
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Look! Right here,it's called a "scrum".

153
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
It's like a huddle.

154
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
And is a hum like a scruddle?

155
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
Ross, they're going kill you!

156
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
Why are you doing this, anyway?

157
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
You should've seen the guyshe used to date.

158
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
He's like "Joe Rugby"!

159
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?That's funny!

160
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
Oh, I see. You did that.

161
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
She thought the very idea of meplaying rugby was hilarious.

162
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
So I'll show herhow tough I really am.

163
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
I'm sorry.You are a tough guy.

164
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
The toughest paleontologist I know.

165
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
Ross can take care of himself.It's not like he's Chandler.

166
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Thanks.

167
00:08:48 --> 00:08:49
Don't worry about me.

168
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
I'll just look energeticand stay away from the ball.

169
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
I'll be that guy,right outside the circle.

170
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
Maybe there was a doglooking at him.

171
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
Stay away from that guyand that guy...

172
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
...and that one.Dude, they're all huge!

173
00:09:15 --> 00:09:16
They're no bigger than me.

174
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
You're closer to you. So you lookbigger to you from where you are.

175
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
I'm going to go say "hello".

176
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
I kind of liked it.

177
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
I know what to do.

178
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
I've got to go Red Ross.

179
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
You know, Red Ross?

180
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
Totally don't know.

181
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
That time we were in linefor "Dances With Wolves"...

182
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
...and that guy cut in front of usand I just lost it?

183
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
Screamed at him, turned all red!

184
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
Red Ross!

185
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
You'll see!

186
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
Liam, do me a favor.

187
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
Go easy on Ross.It's his first time.

188
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
You don't say?

189
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
Good luck, babe.

190
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
Come on, get in here!

191
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
Come on!

192
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
Come on, get in the bloody scrum!

193
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
Ross, get in!

194
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
Joey!

195
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
You're not going to believe it!Joshua came in today, and guess what?

196
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
He asked you out?

197
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
But I showed him some cuff links,and I felt his pulse.

198
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
Saucy!

199
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
- What are these?- Electrical plans for the building.

200
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
Okay, should I be scared?

201
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
I know that switch does something.I got these from City Hall.

202
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
I just paid $25and waited for three hours.

203
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
Wow! If only more people knew!

204
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
You really didn't have totake me to the airport.

205
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
Oh, please.Every moment is precious.

206
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
Besides, someone had to ridewith your luggage.

207
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
And your friends don't seem to carethat you're leaving.

208
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
We're not that close.

209
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
Okay. So I guess this is goodbye then.

210
00:11:30 --> 00:11:31
Oh, no!

211
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
It's not goodbye. I'm not leavingtill you get on that plane.

212
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
Okay. Well, I guessit's just "wait here" then.

213
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

214
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
One ticket?

215
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
I just need a pretend ticket.

216
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
I'm sorry.I don't understand.

217
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
Okay, what would you give a kidto play with?

218
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
Are you traveling with a child?

219
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
She'll think I'mhanding you a credit card.

220
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
But what I'll really hand youis a library card.

221
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
A ticket to Yemen is $2100,and we don't take library cards.

222
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
What's the matter?Is something wrong?

223
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
Do you have to stay?

224
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
American Express?

225
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
I can't believe they're doing that!I told them to go easy on him!

226
00:12:26 --> 00:12:31
No offense, but sometimes it's hardto understand you, with the accent.

227
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
That's just halftime.There's more.

228
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
Did you see me?

229
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
I was pretty good.That is one fun game!

230
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
Do me a favor?Grab me some water?

231
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
Thanks!

232
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
I think I'm dying.I really do.

233
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
Poor baby!

234
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
Tell my son that I love him.

235
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
Excellent!Got to have some more fun!

236
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
They are killing you.

237
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
That's not true.

238
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
She's right.You have to stop!

239
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
No! I'm not stopping.I'm Red Ross!

240
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
Dude, you go back out there,you'll be Dead Ross.

241
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
I'm not quitting.I'm going to finish this game.

242
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
If you insist on it,at least let me help you.

243
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
It's no place for a woman.Those guys will grab anything!

244
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
That's not it. I just know a few thingsthat can help you inflict pain.

245
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
I like that.

246
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
Listen closely.

247
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
Devon has got a weak ankle.

248
00:13:21 --> 00:13:22
One swift kick and he'll back off.

249
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
Bad ankle. Got it!

250
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
And that big bloke with the beard?He's got a trick hip.

251
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
And David over there,he doesn't wear a cup.

252
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
I could use that.Trick hip, no cup. Okay!

253
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
And Liam's got bad knees. Hit him rightand he'll go down like a lamp.

254
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
But Liam's on my team.

255
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
- I don't care. Just get him!- Go and get him!

256
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
I am going back in!

257
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
Red Ross! Yeah!

258
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
What are these?

259
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
Just some picturesI made and hung up.

260
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
I thought they'd brighten up the place.Don't they?

261
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
There's no hole there.I just really like that picture.

262
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
Oh, my God! Look at this!

263
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
But there is a wire there!It's connected to something!

264
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
I don't care! The wires havecome loose in your head!

265
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
If I could follow the wire,I'd find out what it did.

266
00:14:25 --> 00:14:26
And did you?

267
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
No.

268
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
It disappears behind there.

269
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
For a minute, I thoughtit went downstairs.

270
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
But it didn't.

271
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.

272
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
Oh, my God!

273
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
- Hello, darling.- Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.

274
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
Are you sure youdon't want a doctor?

275
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
No, that'll just bring me down!

276
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
This was great! I was great!This was a great day!

277
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
I'm buying everyone coffee.

278
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
Just grab my wallet.It's in my pocket.

279
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
No, not you.

280
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
Your eye's still popping out.I'll go get some ice.

281
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
Ice, yeah!I'm so in the mood for ice.

282
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
You were amazing out there.

283
00:15:11 --> 00:15:12
I kind of was, wasn't I?

284
00:15:13 --> 00:15:13
Oh, my God!

285
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
I made a man twice my size cry!

286
00:15:17 --> 00:15:22
I haven't done that since I was four andI washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

287
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
You really enjoyed yourself,didn't you?

288
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
Are you kidding?I hurt three huge men.

289
00:15:26 --> 00:15:28
I gave a guy a bloody nose!

290
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
I'm not proud of it...

291
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
...but I really am!

292
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
And it's all because of you.

293
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
- Wonderful, amazing you.- I think you've got a concussion.

294
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
No, I'm serious.Thank you.

295
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
You're welcome.

296
00:15:45 --> 00:15:46
I'm sorry.Did that hurt you?

297
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
It's worth the pain.

298
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
You know what? It's not.

299
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
for flight 664 to Yemen.

300
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
Well, I guess I gotta go.

301
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
My Bing-a-ling.

302
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
I'll wait for you.

303
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
How long will you be gone?

304
00:16:10 --> 00:16:15
Well, just until we findan energy source to replace fuel.

305
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
I'll write you every day.

306
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

307
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
Okay. Goodbye.

308
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
Janice! There you are!I had to have one last kiss.

309
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
And also, you said you'd leaveafter I got on the plane!

310
00:16:44 --> 00:16:48
No. I want to see you take off.

311
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
Well, then I guessI'm going to Yemen.

312
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
I'm going to Yemen!

313
00:16:54 --> 00:16:58
When we get to Yemen,can I stay with you?

314
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
All right. The super couldn'tfigure out what it did.

315
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
The $200-an-hour electriciancouldn't figure out what it did.

316
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
I've had sevenpretty serious shocks.

317
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
I give up.

318
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
Thank God.

319
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
I guess Joey was right.

320
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
It does nothing.

321
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
See?

322
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
I'm doing it!I am totally doing it!

323
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
I lost it.
