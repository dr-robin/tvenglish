1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
Hey, hon? Would you help meget the plates down?

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
Hey, here's an idea. Why don'twe use our wedding china today?

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
No, I think we should save our chinafor something really special.

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
Like if the queen of Englandcomes over.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Honey, she keepscanceling on us. Take the hint.

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
What if something breaks?They're expensive.

7
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
What is the point of having themif we never use them?

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
Okay. But if something breaksand then the queen comes over...

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
- I will explain it to her.- Like I'd let you talk to the queen.

10
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
The parade is really good this year.

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Man, those horses can crap.

12
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
Next up is a marching band"from Muskogee", "Oklahoma."

13
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
Muskogee?That's like four hours from Tulsa!

14
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
of the popular daytime soap...

15
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
...Days of our Lives.

16
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
Oh, my God!

17
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
Aren't you one of the stars of thepopular daytime soap "Days of our Lives"?

18
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
I forgot! I'm supposed to be there!

19
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
I can't believe I forgot! I usually writestuff like this down on my arm!

20
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
Stupid long sleeves!

21
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
- What are you gonna do?- I'll come up with a good reason...

22
00:01:07 --> 00:01:08
...why I wasn't there.

23
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
The producers are gonna be mad.They sat us down and said:

24
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
"Everyone has to be there, 6 a.m. Sharp.That means you, Tribbiani."

25
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
Like I was some kind of idiot.

26
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
Well, you proved them wrong.

27
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23

00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
Oh, Emma.

31
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
This is your first Thanksgiving.

32
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
What are you thankful for?

33
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
Mommy's boobies?

34
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
A lot of people are thankful for those.

35
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
Hello? Rachel?

36
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
Who is it?

37
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
It's your favorite sister.

38
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
- Jill?- Amy!

39
00:02:20 --> 00:02:21
Hide my rings.

40
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.

41
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Do you have a hair straightener?

42
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
Hi.

43
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
- Hi.- Hi.

44
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Hair straightener.

45
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
- I haven't seen you in, like, a year.- I know. I know. I've just been crazed.

46
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
Well, me too.I had a baby.

47
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
I decorated Dad's office.

48
00:02:48 --> 00:02:53
Yeah? Well, unless you pushed a deskout of your vagina, not the same thing.

49
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
About that hair straightener,honey, I really need one.

50
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
I'm gonna have dinnerat my boyfriend's house.

51
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Oh, my God.

52
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
Is this Emmett?

53
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
It's Emma.

54
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
It's a girl?

55
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
- Hey, Amy.- Amy, you remember Ross?

56
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
Not really.

57
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
But you are much cuterthan that geeky guy she used to date.

58
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
That was me.

59
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
No, he was this creepy guy from highschool who had this huge crush on her...

60
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
...since, like, the ninth grade.

61
00:03:27 --> 00:03:28
Still me.

62
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
No, I'm not talking about you.

63
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
It was your fat friend's brotherwith that bad Afro.

64
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
Okay, Amy, I'm gonna save yousome time, okay? All me!

65
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
Careful. Careful.

66
00:03:43 --> 00:03:44
Careful!

67
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
I'll tell you what.For the rest of our lives...

68
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
...I'll be careful until told otherwise.

69
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
- This isn't the china we picked out.- I know.

70
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
After you left the store,I chose different ones.

71
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
- Why?- Your taste is a little feminine for me.

72
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
Suddenly flowers are feminine?

73
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
Hey, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!

74
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
- Happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs!- What's going on, Joe?

75
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
Listen, I need a good lie.

76
00:04:08 --> 00:04:09
Okay.

77
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
How about the whole "man walkingon the moon" thing, you know?

78
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
You can see the strings, people!

79
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
No, no, no. I need a good lie to explainwhy I wasn't at a work thing today.

80
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
- Honey, you stink at lying.- I do not.

81
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Really? Let me ask you something.Yesterday at the coffeehouse...

82
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
...I went to the bathroom. When I cameback, my muffin was gone. Who took it?

83
00:04:29 --> 00:04:30
Somebody opened the doorto the coffeehouse...

84
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
...and a raccoon ran in and wentstraight for your muffin. I said:

85
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
"Hey, don't eat that!That's Phoebe's! " And he said...

86
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
He said, "Joey, you stink at lying."What am I gonna do?

87
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.I'll help you.

88
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
- Great. That'd be great. Thank you.- Sure. What was the work thing?

89
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
- "Pick up Grandma at the airport."- Oh, man!

90
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
She's precious.

91
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Do you ever worrythat she's gonna get your real nose?

92
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
Amy...

93
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Yes, I do. I really do.

94
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
Hello?

95
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
Yeah, hang on, one sec.Can I take this upstairs?

96
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Sure. We don't live there, but...

97
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
Seriously? It's just these rooms?

98
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
- I thought you were a doctor.- Yeah. No, Ross has a Ph.D.

99
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
God, she is unbelievable.

100
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
I know. I mean, a Ph.D.Is just as good as an MD.

101
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Sure, Ross, yeah!

102
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,I want you there with your fossil brush.

103
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
- Stupid Thanksgiving.- What?

104
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
- What? What happened?- My boyfriend canceled on me.

105
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
I mean, I finally find a real relationship.

106
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
Someone that I can spend this day with,and then his wife comes back into town!

107
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
I swear, it's almost not evenworth dating married guys.

108
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
Don't say that.

109
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
God, I was so looking forward to this.

110
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
It was gonna be sucha beautiful Thanksgiving.

111
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
We were gonna have sushi.

112
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
Amy, don't cry.

113
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
- Ross, can I talk to you in private?- Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or...?

114
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
Look, I was thinking,if it's okay with Monica...

115
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
...I would like to invite Amyto Thanksgiving.

116
00:06:15 --> 00:06:20
I think that's a great idea. It'll be likethe Pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.

117
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
Look, I know she's a little tough to take.

118
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
But she has nowhere else to go,and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.

119
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
- And I would like them to bond.- I don't want them bonding too much.

120
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
I don't want her telling Emmashe needs a nose job.

121
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
Ross, she may need one. We're justgonna have to make our peace with that!

122
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
- Hi!- Hey.

123
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
Hey, you guys. This is my sister, Amy.

124
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
This is Chandler, Joey,Phoebe, and you know Mon.

125
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Oh, my God.

126
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
You're on "Days of our Lives"!

127
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
Yeah.

128
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
Wow! They must puta lot of makeup on you.

129
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
Happy Thanksgiving.

130
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
- Hey.- Hi.

131
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
So welcome. Is this the first timeyou're seeing Emma?

132
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
Yeah, I think so.It's nice to meet you, Emma.

133
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
- Phoebe.- That's a funny noise.

134
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
- Pheebs? I still need some help here.- Right. Okay.

135
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
So it's not just the lie you tell,but it's the way you tell it. For example...

136
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
...if you look at the ground whenyou talk, people know you're lying.

137
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
I don't know why this is so hard for me.Lying is basically just acting...

138
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
...and I am a terrific actor.- You are a terrific actor.

139
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
- Hey. Where's the baby?- We just put her down for a nap.

140
00:07:40 --> 00:07:43
Listen, I was just thinking.You know what would be incredible?

141
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
If you guys died!

142
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
Thank you, Amy.

143
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
No, no, then I would get the baby.

144
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
It would be just like a movie. At firstI wouldn't know what to do with her.

145
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
And then I would rise to the occasion.Then I'd get a makeover and get married.

146
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
That's a great movie!

147
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
Yeah. Listen, not that you guyscould stop me or anything...

148
00:08:03 --> 00:08:05
...because you know, you'd be dead.

149
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
But I was thinking aboutchanging her name.

150
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.

151
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
Emma.

152
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
Emma? Ross wants you.

153
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
Phoebe!

154
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
Why does she keep making that noise?

155
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
Honey, I don't knowhow to tell you this...

156
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
...but if something were to happento Ross or myself...

157
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
...you wouldn't get the baby.- Well, who would?

158
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
Well, we haven't officiallyasked them yet...

159
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
...but we would wantMonica and Chandler.

160
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
I can't believe you'd want usto raise Emma.

161
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
Oh, my God, I'm so moved.

162
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
I don't believe this. Hold on a second.You guys die...

163
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
...and I don't get your baby?

164
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Amy, see, we're a lot closerto Monica and Chandler.

165
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
We see them every day. And truthfully,you don't seem connected to the baby.

166
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
Connected? To what? She's a lump.

167
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
You know, guys, I've gotta saythis means so much to me.

168
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
I mean, that you wouldtrust me with your child.

169
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
I mean, we all knowthat Monica and I have been...

170
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
...trying to have a baby of our own.

171
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
You know, I've had my doubtsabout my skills as a father, but...

172
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
That you two...

173
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
- That you two...- This guy?

174
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
Seriously?

175
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
Okay, it's time for dinner.

176
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
Everyone, we're using our fancy china...

177
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
...and it's very expensive,so please be careful.

178
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
Okay, just to be clear, comedy withthe plates will not be well-received.

179
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
Hey!

180
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
How come my plate's less fancythan everyone else's?

181
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?

182
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
No, honey. That's a special plate.

183
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
See, it's a game.Whoever gets that plate wins.

184
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
I can't believe I won!

185
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
You know, this is such a slapin the face. I mean, I'm your sister...

186
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
...and you would give your babyto these strangers over me.

187
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Monica is Ross' sister.

188
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
No, Ross' sister was really fat.

189
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
That was me.

190
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
No, she was this dorky girl in school whofollowed Rachel around like a puppy...

191
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
Amy, you've got to stop doing that!

192
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
Okay, listen, I know you're havinga bit of a family crisis...

193
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
...but you don't have to take it outon the plates.

194
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
I mean, in fact, I think that everyone...

195
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
...should cut their food like this:

196
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
Now, see? This way,you protect the plates...

197
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
...and let's face it, you have fun.

198
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
Okay, how about this?If you guys die...

199
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
...and the crazy plate lady dies...

200
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
...then do I get the baby?- No, if crazy plate lady...

201
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
If Monica dies,then I would get Emma. Right?

202
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
- Well, actually...- Actually what?

203
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
It's just...It's just that in that case...

204
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
...then Emma would goto my parents.

205
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
- What?- Hurts, doesn't it?

206
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
Who has to die for me to get her?

207
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
So if Monica's not around,I'm not good enough to raise Emma?

208
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
No, that is not what we're saying.

209
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
Yeah, he's lying. He looked down.

210
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
Well, what's wrong with me?Am I incompetent?

211
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
Because I managed to survive whateverit is that killed the three of you!

212
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
You're taking this the wrong way.We think you'll be a wonderful parent.

213
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
It's just... You're morethe, you know, fun parent.

214
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
Yeah, and we wanna make sureEmma also has someone like Monica...

215
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
...who's more of a disciplinarian.

216
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
Someone who can be firm and strict.

217
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
That's not how you see me, is it?

218
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
No, you're all about the fun.

219
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
I may not know a lot about babies,but do you really think I'm not capable?

220
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
No. You both are equally capable.

221
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
It's just you're strongestwhen you're together.

222
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
Okay. So if we both had Emma,and I died...

223
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
...she'd have to give her up.

224
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
Sure. Monica would have to give her up.

225
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
I lie better than that, right?

226
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
Let me just get this straight.So my two friends die, I get Emma.

227
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
Then my wife dies. Then Emma,the one tiny ray of hope left in my life...

228
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
...gets taken away from me?- There's your movie.

229
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
Hey, there you are.

230
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
- You disappeared after dinner.- Did somebody miss me?

231
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
Was there a child to raise poorly?

232
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
Ross and Rachel don't knowwhat they're saying.

233
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
It's not like they're so responsible.

234
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
Emma is a product of a bottle of merlotand a five-year-old condom.

235
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
No, but they're right. I'm not a strongfather figure, and I never will be.

236
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
No, you learn these things.You grow into it.

237
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Yeah, but it's not who I am.

238
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
Everything they said is exactly why I wasworried about having a kid. And it's true.

239
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
- And look, everybody knows it.- I don't know it.

240
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
I wanna have a kid with you becauseI think you'll be an amazing dad.

241
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
At the fun parts and at the hard parts.

242
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
Well, can you picture me saying,"Go to your room, you're grounded"?

243
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
Can you hear me say,"You're grounded"?

244
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
You said that to me last week.

245
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
How hard is it?"No shoes on the furniture!"

246
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
The producer from "Days" left a messageasking why I wasn't at the parade.

247
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
They said everybody's really pissed offat me. And they all got to meet Santa!

248
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
It's okay.I thought of the perfect lie for you.

249
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
It's easy to remember,and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.

250
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
You weren't at the paradebecause you had a family emergency.

251
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
I like that! Yeah!

252
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
I wasn't at the paradebecause I had a family emergency.

253
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
What happened?

254
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
- My sister's raccoon came...- No, nothing with a raccoon!

255
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
- Wait, what are you doing?- Setting the table.

256
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
We thought it might be niceto use the fancy china for dessert too.

257
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
How nice. Maybe later we can allblow our noses on my wedding dress.

258
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
Hey, dude, you okay?Sorry about before.

259
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
That's okay. You're totally right. I don'tknow anything about disciplining a child.

260
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16
But it did hurt my feelings,and I want you to know that if I die...

261
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
...you don't get Joey.

262
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
In case you hadn't noticed,I'm not talking to you.

263
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
You know, this is just...This is classic Rachel.

264
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
Right. Remember in high school whenI died and didn't give you my baby?

265
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
This might be my one chanceto have a child, Rachel.

266
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
I mean, you know that I have beenso busy focusing on my career...

267
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
- What career?- I'm a decorator.

268
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
You decorate Dad's officeand now you're a decorator?

269
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday,now I'm a koala bear.

270
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
- Why can't you ever be supportive?- You want to talk supportive?

271
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
You didn't come and visit me whenI was in the hospital having the baby!

272
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
You didn't come see me in the hospitalwhen I was getting my lips done!

273
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
I did the first time.

274
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
You know what? You want to knowwhy I am not giving Emily to you?

275
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
- Emma.- Whose side are you on?!

276
00:15:18 --> 00:15:22
I'm not giving you Emma because youcan't handle the responsibility of a child.

277
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
Well, how hard could it be?You do it.

278
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
You wanna know whyyou don't want me to have the baby?

279
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
Because you don't want me to be happy.

280
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
- You have always been jealous of me.- Jealous of what?

281
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
Of your lack of responsibility?Your immaturity?

282
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
Your total disregardfor other people's feelings?

283
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
To name a few.

284
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
You've always been like this.

285
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
You had to have everything,and I couldn't have anything.

286
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
Like in junior high,when you stole Timmy from me.

287
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
I mean, do you even realizehow much that hurt me?

288
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
Timmy was my boyfriend,and you made out with him!

289
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
Come on, that was 20 years ago.Get over it.

290
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
I cannot believethat I invited you here today!

291
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
Yeah, well, you know what I cannotbelieve? That my so-called sister...

292
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
...gets a 30%"%" discount from RalphLauren, and I still have to pay retail?

293
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
It's 45.

294
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
You bitch.

295
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
You just think you're so perfect...

296
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
...with your new babyand your small apartment.

297
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
Well, let me tell you something.Your baby isn't even that cute.

298
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
Too far, Amy. Too far.

299
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
- You take that back.- No.

300
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
- Take it back!- No. What are you gonna do? Make me?

301
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
Hey, man, I work out!

302
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
- So do I.- I do Pilates.

303
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
- I do yoga.- Bring it on!

304
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
Put the plates in the boxes!Put the plates in the boxes!

305
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
- Did you just push me?- Yeah, I think I did.

306
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
All right, that's it.

307
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
Forget the bubble wrap!There isn't time!

308
00:16:56 --> 00:16:57
Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy!

309
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
- Shouldn't we stop this?- Are you out of your mind?

310
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
Let's throw some Jell-O on them!

311
00:17:09 --> 00:17:10
Gross!

312
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
All right, that is it! This is our apartment,and you cannot behave this way!

313
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
If you can't act your age,you shouldn't be here at all.

314
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
Those plates may not be as nice asthe pretty pink ones that I picked out...

315
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
...but they're important to Monica.And I want you to apologize to her, now.

316
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
- I'm sorry.- Mon, I'm so sorry.

317
00:17:37 --> 00:17:38
Okay. That's better.

318
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
Now, I want you to apologizeto each other and mean it.

319
00:17:42 --> 00:17:43
- Sorry.- Sorry.

320
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
By the way, that fightwas totally arousing.

321
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
Dude, well done.

322
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,you can totally take care of Emma.

323
00:17:55 --> 00:17:57
Yeah? Well, thanks.

324
00:17:57 --> 00:18:00
So...So now do I get Joey?

325
00:18:01 --> 00:18:05
Okay. But you should know he eats a lotand shoves pennies up his nose.

326
00:18:09 --> 00:18:11
Are you okay, Mon?

327
00:18:11 --> 00:18:14
I mean, these things happen.I mean, it's just a plate.

328
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
- It's not like somebody died.- It's all right. You can mourn.

329
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
Thank you. It was so beautiful!

330
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
I'm gonna go to Joey'sand get the pies.

331
00:18:24 --> 00:18:27
Actually, not pies. It's just pie.

332
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
I don't care.

333
00:18:30 --> 00:18:33
Oh, my God, I've lost the will to scold.

334
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
Look, Amy...

335
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
...we got a little...

336
00:18:40 --> 00:18:42
...a little out-of-control over there.

337
00:18:43 --> 00:18:44
And I'm sorry.

338
00:18:44 --> 00:18:46
You're my sister...

339
00:18:46 --> 00:18:48
...and if it really meansthat much to you...

340
00:18:48 --> 00:18:51
- So you're gonna give me the baby?- No, I was...

341
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
I was gonna let you usemy Ralph Lauren discount.

342
00:18:54 --> 00:18:57
You are not gonna regret this.

343
00:18:59 --> 00:19:02
- She needs changing.- No, no, no. I'll get her.

344
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
I am super confident, totally responsibleand fourth in line to raise Emma.

345
00:19:05 --> 00:19:09
I'll be right there, Emma! Just let meget my trusty diaper bag here.

346
00:19:13 --> 00:19:16
Well, what do you know?I guess I'll be the one who dies first.

347
00:19:24 --> 00:19:27
- Does Monica know about her plates?- Nope.

348
00:19:27 --> 00:19:28
- Broke them all, huh?- Yep.

349
00:19:28 --> 00:19:30
- You gonna tell her?- Nope.

350
00:19:31 --> 00:19:34
Hey. So I'm gonnaput the plates back.

351
00:19:34 --> 00:19:37
I think you're right. We shouldn'tuse these plates for a long time.

352
00:19:37 --> 00:19:40
- Like only if the queen comes?- Maybe not even then.

353
00:19:41 --> 00:19:42
Hey. I did it.

354
00:19:42 --> 00:19:45
I told my producer I had a familyemergency. He totally bought it.

355
00:19:45 --> 00:19:49
- Thanks for teaching me how to lie.- No problem. Next week, stealing.

356
00:19:50 --> 00:19:53
- Bye, plates.- You told her you broke all the plates?

357
00:19:54 --> 00:19:57
What?!Something happened with the plates?

358
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
Yeah, this raccoon came in...

359
00:20:05 --> 00:20:06
