1
00:00:06 --> 00:00:10
Oh, my God, you cleaned!Look at these floors!

2
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
You did the windows!I have been begging for months!

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
- And nagging works!- No, I didn't actually do this.

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
Oh, no. Was I cleaningin my sleep again?

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
No, it wasn't you.

6
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
- Well, then, who?- I got a maid. Yay!

7
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
I hope you mean "mistress," becauseif some other woman was cleaning...

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
I know you don't liketo relinquish control.

9
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
"Relinquish" is just a fancy wordfor "lose."

10
00:00:36 --> 00:00:41
She's nice, and she mentioned that sheadored how you arranged the sponges.

11
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
Did she really say that?

12
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
Yes, I distinctly remember.I thought it was a joke.

13
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
- Now, just give her a chance, okay?- Fine, I can do it.

14
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
- What's the matter?- Usually when I'm anxious, I clean.

15
00:00:56 --> 00:00:57

18
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
Whose cell phone is that?It's so annoying.

19
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
I think it's coming from your bag.

20
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
I never get calls!

21
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
Hello?

22
00:01:40 --> 00:01:45
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloweenparty. Ursula's fiance.

23
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!How'd you get this number?

24
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
I have a friend who's a cop,and he got it.

25
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
Wow. What an incredible violationand wonderful surprise!

26
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
You should knowI broke up with Ursula.

27
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
Oh, you did?He did it, he did it!

28
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
- What did he do?- Shh! I'm talking!

29
00:02:03 --> 00:02:08
Anyway, I was wondering if you werethe sort of person who eats lunch?

30
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
Are you asking me out?

31
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
Because it'd be weird since youjust broke up with my sister.

32
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Bye.

33
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
Wait! I said that so you'd thinkI was a good person!

34
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
Fight for me!

35
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
I won't take "no" for an answer.

36
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
Not great, we can work on it.

37
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
in two hours.

38
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
How do you know where I live?

39
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
I've got friends too.

40
00:02:37 --> 00:02:38
Okay, bye.

41
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!

42
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
This day is gonna be much betterthan I thought it was gonna be.

43
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.

44
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
So apparently I'm availablefor lunch.

45
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
I can't. I'm apartment hunting.

46
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
You're moving?

47
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
I can't live with Joeyonce the baby comes.

48
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
I don't want my child's first wordsto be, "How you doin'?"

49
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
Does Joey know you're moving?

50
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
We haven't discussed it,but he'll be relieved.

51
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
He brought this girl over,and I talked about morning sickness.

52
00:03:11 --> 00:03:12
I showed her my pregnancy book.

53
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
- That's not really porn?- Not so much.

54
00:03:16 --> 00:03:21
I heard in the elevator this morningthat a woman in my building died.

55
00:03:21 --> 00:03:26
Oh, my God. Was she old?Does she have a view?

56
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
How great would that be?You living in my building?

57
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
I could take care of the baby,come over whenever I want...

58
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
...with your permission.

59
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
That really would be great.Well, can we see it?

60
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
Maybe we shouldn't.If she just died this morning.

61
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
Yeah. No. No, you're right.

62
00:03:47 --> 00:03:48
- Shall we?- Yeah.

63
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
Yes?

64
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
Hi. I'm Ross Geller.I live in the building.

65
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
And I'm Rachel,an admirer of the building.

66
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passingaway, and I am so sorry for your loss.

67
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
- She didn't pass away.- What?

68
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
- My mother's still alive.- Oh, thank God!

69
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
It looked like we were gonna lose herthis morning, but she's tough.

70
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
Are you close with her?

71
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
Of course. She and I wouldtalk all the time...

72
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
...in the laundry room.

73
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
You speak Dutch?

74
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
I would, but it's just too painful.

75
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
So she's really not dead.

76
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
No. She's hanging in there.

77
00:04:43 --> 00:04:48
Could you tell me, is she hanging inin a one-bedroom or a two?

78
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
This tile cleaner is incredible.Where did you get it?

79
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
Oh, well...I make it myself.

80
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
It's two parts ammonia and one partlemon juice. The secret ingredient...

81
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
You know what? We just met.

82
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
Okay. I'm gonna get the clothesfrom the laundry room...

83
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
...then I'll clean behind the fridge.

84
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
I love her!

85
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
I'll be back in a minute.

86
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
Okay.

87
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
- See? I told you.- She stole my jeans!

88
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
What?

89
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
I've been lookingfor them all week!

90
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
So she stole your pants,and then came back and wore them?

91
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
Don't you see?It's the perfect crime!

92
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
She must have beenplanning this for years!

93
00:05:35 --> 00:05:36
I'll prove it.

94
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
I dropped a pen in my lap, and it leftan ink stain on the crotch.

95
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
When she comes back, I will find itand show you that stain!

96
00:05:46 --> 00:05:51
Is it possible the company that soldthe jeans made more than one pair?

97
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
I guess.

98
00:05:52 --> 00:05:57
Shouldn't we give her the benefit ofthe doubt before we search her crotch?

99
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
Fine. I'm glad I didn't giveher my secret ingredient.

100
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
By the way,what is your secret ingredient?

101
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
- Hi.- Come in. I'm so glad you're here.

102
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Yeah. Me too.

103
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
Not in the shaky, angry wayyou are, though.

104
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.I got the engagement ring back.

105
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
Just seeing her brought it all back.

106
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
All the lies, the way she used me.

107
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
I just... I get so angry,just looking at her...

108
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
- Face.- Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
I'm sorry. It's just,when I look at you...

110
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
...I see her.

111
00:06:41 --> 00:06:46
And when I see her,I get a little bit angry.

112
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
- Maybe this is too weird.- Wait.

113
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
There's only a problemwhen I look at you.

114
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
I got it. I got it.

115
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
No, don't tear out your eyes!

116
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
- I was just gonna take out my lenses.- Oh, yeah. Try that.

117
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
So, is that better?

118
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
Not really.

119
00:07:09 --> 00:07:14
You're blurry, but you stilllook like Ursula. You're "Blursula."

120
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
Okay, wait. Maybe...

121
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
If I just don't look at youfor a while.

122
00:07:24 --> 00:07:28
See? It works. I'm not angry atall anymore. This is a great date!

123
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
Look, Eric, turn around.

124
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
I like you, but it shouldn't bethis hard. It's our first date.

125
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
It's supposed to beabout excitement and...

126
00:07:39 --> 00:07:44
..."He touched my hand,did he mean to?" and first kisses...

127
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
Second kisses...

128
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
Thanks for the coffee, or:

129
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
Yeah, we're done.

130
00:08:08 --> 00:08:12
Hey, Ross. You wanna go seethat new IMAX movie on tide pools?

131
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
- Really?- No.

132
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
But I got Knicks tickets for us.

133
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
- Sweet!- All right, let's go.

134
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
I have to stop by my place.

135
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
To tape the game? You do this everytime. You're not gonna be on TV!

136
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
I have to see if this apartmentis available.

137
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
- You're switching apartments?- It's for Rachel.

138
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
- She has an apartment.- She's gonna move.

139
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
- She is?- Yeah.

140
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
You didn't expect herto live there with the baby?

141
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
I didn't really think about it.

142
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Hey, Gunther, you're an "ezel"!

143
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
Damn it!

144
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
- Nice jeans.- Oh, thanks.

145
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
- I like your top.- Oh. You're not getting it.

146
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
- What happened?- Oh. I fell asleep!

147
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
I was thinking about takingmy lunch break.

148
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
Will you do the top of the cabinets?That'll work up your appetite.

149
00:09:18 --> 00:09:19
All right.

150
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
Hello.

151
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
What's going on?

152
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
I'm sorry. I've never had a maidbefore. Is this not okay?

153
00:09:50 --> 00:09:55
- How was the game?- It was okay. I ate way too much.

154
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
Ross said you were lookingfor a new place.

155
00:10:01 --> 00:10:05
Yeah. Hopefully across the street.If certain Dutch people would let go.

156
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.

157
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
Joey, I have to go.There's no room for a baby.

158
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
No room? It's a baby.It's, like, this big.

159
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
You could put it over here.

160
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
Or we could put it right here.Cute, right?

161
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
Or over here.You wouldn't even notice it.

162
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
"Where's the baby?""Oh, it's right over..."

163
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
Honey, it's not just a matterof where you put it.

164
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
A baby changes things.They cry all the time.

165
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
Imagine bringing home a girl,trying to score with a screaming baby.

166
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
I could use a challenge.It's getting pretty easy.

167
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
It's so sweet that you want meto stay, but I can't.

168
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
It would disrupt your entire life.

169
00:10:47 --> 00:10:52
It's just...I love living with you so much.

170
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
- I wish things didn't have to change.- I know.

171
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
You know, I blame Ross for this.

172
00:10:59 --> 00:11:00
I do too, a little bit.

173
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
I'm gonna miss you.

174
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
You're the hottest roommateI ever had.

175
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
Oh, no, I have to go.I have a massage appointment.

176
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.I'll pay you.

177
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
No, I've gotten in troublefor that before.

178
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
- See you later?- Absolutely.

179
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
I love the way you kiss.

180
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!You'll see.

181
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
- Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.- How come?

182
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
Because I put my headbetween her legs.

183
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
- To see her pants?- They're my pants!

184
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
Did you see the stain?

185
00:11:44 --> 00:11:48
No. I was getting into position,and everything went dark.

186
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
She is not stealing from us.Will you let this go?

187
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Fine.

188
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
- She's wearing my bra!- Oh, dear God!

189
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
My pink flowered bra!I recognize the strap!

190
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
Yet you don't recognizethat you're crazy?

191
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
I'm leaving, and you're gonna lookat Brenda's bra.

192
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
Here's another plan. No.

193
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
I would, but she thinksI'm attracted to her.

194
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
- Why?- Did you not hear where my head was?

195
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
We're a team.We're in this together.

196
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
I fear a jury will see itthe same way.

197
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
I catch you lookingat women's breasts all the time.

198
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
You see that?

199
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
Do you see this?

200
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
All right.Okay. I get your point.

201
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
If it's not her bra,will you let her clean?

202
00:12:36 --> 00:12:41
Yes. You'll know it's mine because onthe right, there's a noticeable rip.

203
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
You need new clothes.

204
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
- Hi. How is she?- It's not looking good.

205
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
Well, I brought her some "bloemen."

206
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
Would you like to say goodbye?I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.

207
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
Oh, I don't know that it would.

208
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
- Well, her memory is pretty much gone.- All right, then.

209
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
- Hey!- Welcome back.

210
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
- Shall we continue?- I'm still tired from this afternoon.

211
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
- Why?- The sex.

212
00:13:25 --> 00:13:26
- What sex?- Our sex.

213
00:13:26 --> 00:13:27
We didn't have sex.

214
00:13:27 --> 00:13:31
If it wasn't with you, I had sexwith somebody that looked like...

215
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
- You had sex with Ursula?- A little bit.

216
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
I thought she was youand I kissed her and...

217
00:13:42 --> 00:13:47
- You didn't notice different clothes?- I was just so excited to see you.

218
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
- This is too weird.- I don't wanna lose you.

219
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
It's like I was saying to Ursulawhen I was making love...

220
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
Yeah. It's too weird.

221
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
So I guess this is it.

222
00:14:02 --> 00:14:03
Yeah.

223
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
Maybe it's for the best.

224
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
- You smell just like her.- Yeah, so do you.

225
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
- What are you doing?- I'm leaning.

226
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
This is where I lean.

227
00:14:31 --> 00:14:32
Okay.

228
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
- Brenda, a bee!- What?

229
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
It flew into your blouse! Betterundo your buttons lest it sting you.

230
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
- I think I know what's going on here.- You do?

231
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
Look, I know it must be hardthat your wife is a lesbian...

232
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
...but it's wrong. You're married.

233
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
- I totally understand.- Okay, good.

234
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
Could I just see your bra?

235
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
- Where'd you get those jeans?- You gave them to me.

236
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
- No, I didn't!- All right, I took them.

237
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
I figured it was okay,you've got an ink stain on it.

238
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
- Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?- What bra?

239
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
- The pink one with the flowers.- You mean the one you're wearing?

240
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
I quit!

241
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
Sounds about right.

242
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
What is this?

243
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
This is just to give you an idea.

244
00:15:34 --> 00:15:39
We can put screens so the baby hasprivacy, and a mobile over the crib...

245
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
...and here's a baby monitor which,for now, we can use as walkie-talkies.

246
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
You're so sweet!

247
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
Oh, my God!And you gave the baby Hugsy!

248
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
That's really just to showwhere the baby would go.

249
00:15:59 --> 00:16:02
Why don't I hold on to himso there's no confusion?

250
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.It's gonna be loud.

251
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
- I'm loud.- It'll be up all night.

252
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
- I'm up all night.- It'll poop.

253
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
Hello!

254
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
What about all the women?

255
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
If I'm bringing home a womanwho can't stand a baby...

256
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
...then maybe I don't wannabe with that woman.

257
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
Or maybe we'll do itin the bathroom of the club!

258
00:16:26 --> 00:16:27
Joey, are you sure?

259
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
Yeah. Look, I know sometimesit'll be hard, okay...

260
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
...but it'll also be really,really great.

261
00:16:35 --> 00:16:39
Please, Rachel,I really want you to stay.

262
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
I want me to stay too. Thank you.

263
00:16:45 --> 00:16:49
- Look at this crib! It's so cute!- I know. I found it on the street.

264
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
Are you...? Really?This is in such good condition.

265
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
Whoa! What's under the cover?

266
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
- I don't know.- It's moving.

267
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
It's got a tail! Get it out!

268
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
Okay!

269
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
Well, the old lady died.And how do I know?

270
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
Because her dying wishwas for one last kiss.

271
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
But I don't care becauseyou got the apartment. Yes!

272
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
Yeah. I think I'm gonna stay here.

273
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
Isn't that great?

274
00:17:32 --> 00:17:32
