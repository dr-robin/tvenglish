1
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
Joey?

3
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
Did I wake you?

4
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
The One withAll the Wedding Dresses

5
00:01:16 --> 00:01:20
Gunther, could I getanother cup of coffee?

6
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
So what do you do whenyou're not working here?

7
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
- You don't need to fill these silences.- Okay, thanks.

8
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
That's your fourth cup of coffee.

9
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
I'm exhausted becauseJoey started snoring.

10
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
He's in a different room.He's that loud?

11
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
You should hear me.

12
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
It's nothing to be proud of.Go to a sleep clinic.

13
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
I'm not going to any clinic.

14
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
I don't have a problem.You have the problem.

15
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
You should go to a "Quit-being-a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.

16
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
- They don't have those.- Yeah, they do.

17
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!

18
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
There, you just had your first class.

19
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
I used to date a light sleeper.

20
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
Whenever I snored,he rolled me over...

21
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
Oh, yeah!

22
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
He'd roll me over,and I'd stop snoring.

23
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
Next time you snore,I'm rolling you over!

24
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
I gotta do what I gotta do.You gotta do what you gotta do.

25
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
Hey, guys.

26
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
Oh, the Olympics!

27
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
Have you picked a date?

28
00:02:20 --> 00:02:20
No. Not yet.

29
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
I still cannot believeyou're engaged.

30
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
Because it's so fast.Not because you're a loser.

31
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
Thanks.Has anyone seen Rach?

32
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
She's upstairs not doing the dishes.

33
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
I won't do them this time.Even if they sit there until...

34
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
I'll do them when I get home.

35
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Emily found thiswedding dress in London...

36
00:02:42 --> 00:02:42
Already?

37
00:02:43 --> 00:02:43
But it didn't fit.

38
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
There's a store herewith one left in her size.

39
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
But the groom can't see...

40
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
- I'll pick it up for you.- Thanks.

41
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
She's got you running errands,picking up wedding dresses...

42
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
Wah-pah!

43
00:02:56 --> 00:02:57
What's wah-pah?

44
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
You know. Whipped.

45
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Wah-pah!

46
00:03:03 --> 00:03:04
That's not whipped.

47
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
Whipped is...

48
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
That's what I did.

49
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
You can't do anything!

50
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
Hey, Mon.I was just doing these dishes.

51
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
Do you have a minute?

52
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
I was just about totake a break anyway.

53
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
So listen...

54
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
...I know we haven't hada chance to talk...

55
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
...since Emily and Idecided to get married.

56
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
And I was just wonderinghow you were.

57
00:03:45 --> 00:03:50
If you were getting married,I would feel kind of...

58
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
You know?

59
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
It definitely took me by surprise.But, you know...

60
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
...I'm okay.

61
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
I just wanted to check.

62
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
That's sweet. Thank you.

63
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
You're great.

64
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
And I know someday this willhappen for you too.

65
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
You just hang in there.

66
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
"Hang in there"?

67
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
No, I didn't mean...

68
00:04:15 --> 00:04:20
You haven't heard of a seriousrelationship called "me and Joshua"?

69
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
I thought you hadjust been on four dates.

70
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
I didn't realize that hadbecome anything.

71
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Oh no, it has become.

72
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
Oh no, those were four great dates.

73
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
I mean, and the connection!

74
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
Emotionally, mentally.You know?

75
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Physically.

76
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
- That's incredible.- I know, isn't it?

77
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
I'm right there with Joshua.You are right there with Emily.

78
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
And it's kind of like it's a tie.

79
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
I gotta get back to my dishes.

80
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
I gotta get to work.

81
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
You know what wouldmake me happy?

82
00:05:01 --> 00:05:02
You know, what's that?

83
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
If the four of us could all,you know, hang out together.

84
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
Emily's coming intotown this weekend.

85
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
Why don't we allhave dinner Sunday night?

86
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
That would be great!

87
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
All right. It's a date!

88
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
"Hang in there."You hang in there.

89
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
- Did you say something?- No, just singing.

90
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
Oh, my God!

91
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Look at this one!

92
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
It's so beautiful.

93
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
About half of these willend up getting divorced.

94
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
May I help you ladies?

95
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.

96
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
What's the name?

97
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
- Emily Waltham.- Yes, I have it right here.

98
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
Would you like to try it on,Miss Waltham?

99
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
You're the most beautiful brideI've ever seen.

100
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
I am, aren't I?

101
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
Miss Waltham?

102
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
We're closing.

103
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
All right.

104
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
And could I get my ring back?

105
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
All right, buddy.Time to roll over.

106
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
You are going to a clinic!You're going to a clinic!

107
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
And a pajama store!

108
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
Does she use the cups?

109
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Yes, I believe she does.

110
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
Does she use the plates?Yes, I believe she does!

111
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
Thank you.

112
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Thank you very much.

113
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
Thank you for coming.

114
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
- Just a second.- No, no! Let me in!

115
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
Can you hold on a minute?

116
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
No! You have tolet me in right now!

117
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
Are you alone?

118
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
All right.

119
00:07:27 --> 00:07:28
This sucks.

120
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
I have to stay up all nightbefore I go to the stupid clinic.

121
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
I'm so tired.

122
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
It's six o'clock.

123
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
I hear you and Joshua aregoing out with Ross and Emily.

124
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
I think that's really cool.

125
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
I think you're handlingthat really well.

126
00:07:44 --> 00:07:45
"Handling it"?

127
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
There's nothing to handle.

128
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Maybe I'd have a problem with thisif it wasn't for me and Joshua.

129
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
They're not going toget married anyway.

130
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
They rushed into this thingso fast, it's ridiculous!

131
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
They'll be engaged for like what?A year?

132
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
One of them will realizewhat they've done...

133
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
...and call it off.

134
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
You'll be dancing at my weddingbefore you dance at theirs.

135
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
You know, I don't dance at weddings.

136
00:08:09 --> 00:08:09
Why not?

137
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
Weddings are a great placeto meet women.

138
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
When I dance,I look like this.

139
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
Hey, man.

140
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
What are you doingfour weeks from today?

141
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
- Nothing.- Nothing.

142
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
I am...

143
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
...free.

144
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
Because we're gettingmarried in a month.

145
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
In a month?

146
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
You mean 30 days?

147
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
From now?

148
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
That's great!

149
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
She always wanted to get marriedwhere her parents did...

150
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
...but it's getting torn down.

151
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
I know it's crazy,but everything's been so crazy...

152
00:08:53 --> 00:08:54
...and it just feels right.

153
00:08:55 --> 00:08:59
Hey, that's the day afterI start menstruating!

154
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
This isn't mine.

155
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
What's up?

156
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
Your voice soundedall squeaky on the phone.

157
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
Nothing.I just wanted to see you.

158
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
See you and hug you.

159
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
See you...

160
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
Great!

161
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
Sit.

162
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
You okay?

163
00:09:34 --> 00:09:39
I'm more than okay.I am really, really happy.

164
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
Want to know why?

165
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
Do I?

166
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
Because I am really happy about us.

167
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
I think we are soon the right track.

168
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
I think we are working.I think we are clicking.

169
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
- You know?- Yeah, sure, sure.

170
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
We're clicking.

171
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
If there was justone little area where...

172
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
...I think we need to work on,I would think...

173
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
...it's that we'rejust not crazy enough.

174
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
I got to say, I'm not too sureI agree with that.

175
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
You know, yeah, you're right.

176
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
We have our fun. Yeah?

177
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
I mean, like crazy!You know?

178
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
All right.

179
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
This is going to sound, you know,a little hasty.

180
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
But just go with me.

181
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
What if we got married?

182
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Oh, I know. It's so totally like...

183
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
..."Whoa, can we do this?"You know?

184
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
But it just feels right.Don't you think it does?

185
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
I mean, it just feels right.Don't you...?

186
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
Rachel...

187
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
...you're...

188
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
...a real...

189
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
...special lady.

190
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
But my divorce isn't final yet...

191
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
...and we've been on four dates.

192
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
So I'm thinking: No...

193
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
...but...

194
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
...thanks.

195
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
You idiot!

196
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
- Your name, please?- Joey Tribbiani.

197
00:11:12 --> 00:11:16
Did you stay up all nightin preparation for your study?

198
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
Sir?

199
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
Yes, he did.

200
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
All right. We'll call youin a few minutes.

201
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
Check out that girl.She's really hot.

202
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
Yeah, she is.

203
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
How you doing?

204
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
- What?- You're coming on to the entire room.

205
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
- I'm Chandler.- I'm Marjorie.

206
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
- Do you mind if I sit?- Please.

207
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
So what are you in for?

208
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
I talk in my sleep.

209
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
What a coincidence!I listen in my sleep.

210
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
So why don't you give me your number?

211
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
Are you ready?

212
00:12:04 --> 00:12:07
I got it! Mine!

213
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
- Congratulations!- Thank you!

214
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
My turn, my turn!

215
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
Okay, ready?

216
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
That was a terrible throw!

217
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
I won't throw it right to you.That's not real.

218
00:12:27 --> 00:12:31
Look at me. My big concernis what's real?

219
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
Oh, my God!

220
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
We're really sad, aren't we?

221
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
Yeah, I think we are.

222
00:12:41 --> 00:12:42
This isn't even my dress.

223
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48
At least you didn't rent yours froma store called "It's Not Too Late."

224
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
- I'm changing out of this.- Me, too.

225
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
In half an hour?

226
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
Me, too.

227
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
All right, now throw itstraight this time.

228
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
I'm getting married!

229
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
I hate my regular clothes now.

230
00:13:10 --> 00:13:10
I look down and I know...

231
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
...this won't be the mostspecial day of my life.

232
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
I mean, it was kind offun for a while...

233
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
...but didn't you feel kind of silly?

234
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
I guess.

235
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Oh, my God!

236
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
You're such a cheater!

237
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
Hello, little ones.

238
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
- So, is Joey going to stop snoring?- Yep!

239
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
And a beautiful womanagreed to go out with me.

240
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
Joey wanted to ask her out,but, you know, she picked me.

241
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
How'd that happen?

242
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
Because I'm cooler.

243
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
No, seriously.

244
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
She's the kind of girl...Joey was unconscious.

245
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
Hey, you guys!What's happening?

246
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
Oh, my God!

247
00:13:53 --> 00:13:53
What is that?

248
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
They gave it to meat the sleep clinic...

249
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
...and it's going to help menot to snore.

250
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?

251
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
You don't have towear it unless you are.

252
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
I know I don't have to.

253
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
It tastes good.

254
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
Plus, you look cool.

255
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
I just called Joshua.

256
00:14:17 --> 00:14:18
How'd it go?

257
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
I did my best toconvince him that I'm not...

258
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
...some crazy girl who'sdying to get married.

259
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
And I'm going througha hard time.

260
00:14:24 --> 00:14:25
What'd he say?

261
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
His answering machinewas very understanding.

262
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
I feel blue.

263
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
I bet you anythinghe'll call you again.

264
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
Yeah, maybe. But, you know,I don't think I even care.

265
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
I don't think he'sthe one I'm sad about.

266
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
I know I said I'm totally okaywith Ross getting married.

267
00:14:47 --> 00:14:48
But as it turns out...

268
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
...I don't think I'm handling itall that well.

269
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
Yeah, maybe.

270
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
And I'm just trying tofigure out why.

271
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
Any luck?

272
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
You know how Ross and I havealways been on again, off again?

273
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
I guess I just figured,somewhere down the road...

274
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
...we would be on again.

275
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
Again.

276
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
You know what?I think we all did.

277
00:15:18 --> 00:15:19
I got us reservationsfor Sunday night.

278
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
How about Ernie's at 9:00?

279
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
Well, you'd better make it for three.

280
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
I don't know if we'regoing to be hungry at three.

281
00:15:29 --> 00:15:30
Three people.

282
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
Joshua's not going to be there.

283
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33
What happened?

284
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
Well, I think he broke up with me.

285
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
No. Why?

286
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
Apparently, he scares easy.

287
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
Rachel, I'm sorry.

288
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
It's okay.

289
00:15:46 --> 00:15:51
Sometimes things don't work outthe way you thought they would.

290
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
Come here.

291
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
Don't you have to go pick up Emily?

292
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
Are you okay?

293
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
I got my girls.

294
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
Hey, you know what mightcheer you up?

295
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
What?

296
00:16:27 --> 00:16:28
I got to tell you...

297
00:16:28 --> 00:16:32
...this really does put mein a better mood.

298
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
I wish there was a job whereI could wear this all the time.

299
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
Maybe someday there will be.

300
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
Chandler's coming by to borrowcandles for his big date.

301
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
Rachel, don't get it!He'll see us!

302
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
The groom cannot see the bride.

303
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
I'm not going to marry Chandler.

304
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
Not after this!

305
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
Okay guys, just relax.

306
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
I do!

307
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
I got to go.

308
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.

309
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
Food's here. Fair enough.

310
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
Fifteen-minute warning.

311
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
Dude, I am trying to sleep!
