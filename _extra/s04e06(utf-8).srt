1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
- Thanks for the tasty dinner.- You're welcome for a tasty dinner.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
What are you guys looking at?

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
Ross and the most beautiful girlin the world.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
Yeah, come to Papa!

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
I know!

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:19
Probably the only timeI'll say this...

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
...but did you see the ass on her?

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
What did you...?When did you...?

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
How did you...?How did you get a girl like that?

10
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?An aerobics instructor?

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Actually, she's a paleontologydoctoral candidate...

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.

13
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
But that's, like, the easiest era.

14
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
I've seen her at work,but I always figured...

15
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
But I made her dinner.

16
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
We had a great time.And we're going out again tomorrow.

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Maybe her friends are betting to seewho gets the biggest geek.

18
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
Fine by me.Hope she wins.

19
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
The One with the Dirty Girl

20
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
You have any wrapping paper?

21
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
Is it for my birthday present?

22
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
It was your birthday months ago.

23
00:01:41 --> 00:01:46
You said you ordered something specialand it just hadn't come yet.

24
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
I have a call in about that.

25
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
It's for Kathy. It's an early copyof her favorite book.

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
"The Velveteen Rabbit"!

27
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
When the boy's lovemakes the rabbit real...

28
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
Don't touch it becauseyour fingers have destructive oils.

29
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
Then you'd better keep it awayfrom Ross' hair.

30
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
This is pretty rare.How did you get that?

31
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
No big deal.I just went to some bookstores...

32
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
...talked to some dealers, calledsome of the author's grandchildren.

33
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
Honey, that's so sweet.

34
00:02:15 --> 00:02:19
What a great way to say, "I secretlylove you, roommate's girlfriend."

35
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
It doesn't say that.

36
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
Does it?

37
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
How will it look when you get hersomething incredibly meaningful...

38
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
...and expensive, and her boyfriend,Joey, gives her an orange?

39
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
I'll make sure Joey gets hersomething really great.

40
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
It's got to be better than that book.

41
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
Like a crossbow!

42
00:02:38 --> 00:02:39
Once again, I am sorry.

43
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Thank you. Bye.

44
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
I had to turn down a jobcatering a funeral for 60 people.

45
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
Oh, my God!What happened?

46
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
Sixty guests.

47
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
Why'd you have to turn it down?

48
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
I don't havethe money or equipment...

49
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
...to handle something that bigon such short notice.

50
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
Wow, what is with all the negativity?

51
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
You sound like "Moni-can't",not "Moni-can"!

52
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
Moni-ca.

53
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
You've been playing aroundwith this catering for years.

54
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
- Do you want to be a caterer?- I don't know.

55
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
There you go!That's the spirit!

56
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
If you need money, I will lendyou money. Just get moving!

57
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
Really? I'd need $500for all the food and supplies.

58
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
It's worth it if it'll get you moving.You haven't worked in months!

59
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
Neither have you.

60
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
Yes, but I'm doing this.

61
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
That would be great! Thank you.

62
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
Can I borrow your apartment keys?

63
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
Why?

64
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
You can pee here.

65
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
Yes, I can, of course.

66
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
It's okay.The duck's using our bathroom anyway.

67
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
What are you gettingfor her birthday?

68
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
We've been dating a couple weeks.I got to get her something?

69
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
You have to get hersomething really nice.

70
00:04:00 --> 00:04:01
- I know!- And not one of your coupons...

71
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
...for an hour of "Joey Love".

72
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
A crossword!Can I help?

73
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
Last week I got allbut three answers...

74
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
...and I want to finish onewithout any help.

75
00:04:15 --> 00:04:15
Fine.

76
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
But you can't help me developmy new universal language.

77
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
How'd it go?

78
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
Oh, my God!It was the best funeral ever!

79
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
Everyone loved the food.

80
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
I even got another funeralfor tomorrow.

81
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
The dead guy from today's best friend.

82
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
It's like I am the official catererfor that accident.

83
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Mon, I'm so happy for you!

84
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
Thanks. Check outmy new catering stuff.

85
00:04:38 --> 00:04:39
Look!I'm an omelet station!

86
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Omelet? Made to order?

87
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
I'll have one, please.Plus my money.

88
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
I didn't realizeyou needed it right away.

89
00:04:48 --> 00:04:52
You told me to go and be a caterer.So I went. I be'd.

90
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
I used it to buy all this stuff.

91
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
I got another job tomorrow,so I'll pay you back then.

92
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
Okay. Sorry I acted like a bank.

93
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
Would you like to come in?

94
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
Did Homo erectus huntwith wooden tools?

95
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
According to recent findings.

96
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!

97
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
Mitzi is...?

98
00:05:31 --> 00:05:32
My hamster.

99
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
I hope she's okay.I haven't seen her in a while.

100
00:05:35 --> 00:05:36
Have a seat.

101
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
Where?

102
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
Do you...

103
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
Do you have anyCinnamon Fruit Toasties?

104
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
Well, I do.

105
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
Let's go back to my place,light a couple candles...

106
00:05:52 --> 00:05:56
...break open a boxof Cinnamon Fruit Toasties...

107
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
I'd rather not.

108
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
Oh, yeah? Why not?

109
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
Don't take this the wrong way...

110
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
...but your place kind ofhas a weird smell.

111
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
- Is everything in the car?- Did you settle the bill?

112
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
I hate this part.

113
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
Look what we almost left!

114
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
That's not mine.

115
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
Look what we almost took!

116
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart?

117
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
Well, we're all cleaned up.

118
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
Good. Thank you.

119
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
And, well, there'sthis small matter of the...

120
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
- Dear?- The matter of...

121
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
...payment.

122
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
Jack used to handle the finances.

123
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
You know what we should all do?

124
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
Go see a musical.

125
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Sure.

126
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
You know which one?

127
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

128
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
Do you know the name of that one?

129
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
I don't know. "Grease"?

130
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
"Rent"?

131
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Yes! "Rent"!

132
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
So when do you want to go?

133
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
What? I'm sorry.I can't, I'm busy.

134
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
Man, it is so hardto shop for girls.

135
00:07:34 --> 00:07:34
Yes, it is...

136
00:07:34 --> 00:07:37
...at Office Max!

137
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
What did you get her?

138
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
A pen.

139
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
It's two gifts in one.It's a pen that's also a clock.

140
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
- You can't give her that.- Why not?

141
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
She's not 11!

142
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
And it's not the seventh nightof Chanukah.

143
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
What he means by that is,while this is a very nice gift...

144
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
...maybe it's not somethinga boyfriend gives.

145
00:08:01 --> 00:08:02
Sure it is.

146
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
She needs a pen for work.

147
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
She's writing. She turns it over."It's time for my date with Joey!"

148
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
All right. What did you getfor Angela Del Veccio's birthday?

149
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
She didn't have one.

150
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
For three years?

151
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
Look, it's too late,and I got an audition.

152
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
I can't shop anymore.

153
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
I will go outand try to find something for her.

154
00:08:27 --> 00:08:27
Thanks, man.

155
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
While you're at it,could you get her a card?

156
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
Would you like me to write hera little poem as well?

157
00:08:33 --> 00:08:37
Or just get a cardthat has a poem already in it.

158
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
- You have to get our money.- She couldn't stop crying.

159
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
With those thick glasses,her tears look giant.

160
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
I know, it's tough.

161
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
You know what the first thing I didafter my mom's funeral was?

162
00:08:49 --> 00:08:50
Pay the caterer!

163
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
I've had a lot of jobs.

164
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
And there are some peoplewho always try to get out of paying.

165
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
It's either "That massagewasn't long enough"...

166
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
...or "I don't knowany of those songs"...

167
00:08:59 --> 00:09:04
...or "These sombreros aren'tbig enough. Bad little white girl!"

168
00:09:05 --> 00:09:06
So you think she's faking?

169
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
There weren't any tearstill you showed her the bill.

170
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
She sounded pretty upset to me.

171
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
She seems fine now.

172
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
So you just left?Her place was really that bad?

173
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
You throw your jacket on a chairat the end of the day.

174
00:09:30 --> 00:09:35
Like that, only instead of a chair,it's a pile of garbage.

175
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
And instead of a jacket,it's a pile of garbage.

176
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
And instead of the end of the day,it's the end of time...

177
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
...and garbage is allthat has survived.

178
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
- Here.- Wow. Thanks.

179
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
So what happened?

180
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
Nothing.I had to get out of there.

181
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
Next time, you take herto your place.

182
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
I tried that.She says it has a weird smell.

183
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
- What kind of smell?- I don't know. Soap?

184
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
Listen, you like this girl, right?

185
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
You want to see her again?

186
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
So you're going to haveto do it in the mess!

187
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
Yeah, okay. You're right.

188
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
I mean, who cares abouta little sloppiness?

189
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
- It's endearing, really.- All right!

190
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
Now you go get that beautiful pig!

191
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
I just spent the entireafternoon looking for a present...

192
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
...for Kathy that would bebetter than the rabbit.

193
00:10:31 --> 00:10:31
Any luck?

194
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
Yeah, I found this great placecalled "Invisible Things for Kathy".

195
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
Can you give me a handwith all this stuff?

196
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
Just return the book,let Joey give her the clock pen...

197
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
...and you get hersomething worse than that...

198
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
...like a regular pen.

199
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
She's really goingto love this, you know?

200
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
The bottom line is,I want her to have it...

201
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
...even if I don't get to bethe one who gives it to her.

202
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
Honey, that's so sweet.

203
00:10:56 --> 00:10:57
You don't think it's just pathetic?

204
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
Oh, "pathetic"!

205
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
I've been looking all over for you.

206
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
Where?

207
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
Our place. The hall.

208
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
I got something.

209
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
It's a book.

210
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
A book?

211
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
Is it a book that's also a safe?

212
00:11:25 --> 00:11:26
It's a book that's just a book.

213
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
It's the "Velveteen Rabbit".It was her favorite as a kid.

214
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
So just let me knowif she likes it, okay?

215

216
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
Thanks for doing this.I owe you one.

217
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
There wasn't any changefrom that twenty, was there?

218
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
No, it came out to an even twenty.

219
00:11:44 --> 00:11:48
Wow. That's almostas much as a new book.

220
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
You didn't get the money?

221
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
Maybe I can try at intermission?

222
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
You know what?Let's just go.

223
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
We're not leaving till we get paid!

224
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
I don't knowwho she thinks she is.

225
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
Enough is enough!

226
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
Hey, widow?

227
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
Widow?

228
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
Excuse me? Excuse me!

229
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
Thanks. Clearly this isa very, very hard time for you.

230
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
But we provided a service,and we deserve to be paid...

231
00:12:22 --> 00:12:23
...because you ate that service.

232
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
We are not leaving here untilwe are paid every penny, because...

233
00:12:27 --> 00:12:31
...we're part-time caterersand we have no place else to go.

234
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
All right. I'll get my bag.

235
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
Good.

236
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
I'm going to leave some cards here.

237
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
Please think of usfor your next event.

238
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54

239
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56

240
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
Yes, I do.

241
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10

242
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
Guess who?

243
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33

244
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36

246
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
Oh, Cheryl!

247
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08

248
00:14:09 --> 00:14:09
Oh, my God!

249
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
I'm so sorry.I must have freaked out.

250
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
Thank God it's not Mitzi!

251
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
It's just a rat.

252
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20

253
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
I finished it!I did it all by myself!

254
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
And there's nobody to hug.

255
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27

259
00:14:38 --> 00:14:39
How did it go?

260
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
The widow wouldn't pay,so Phoebe yelled at her till she did.

261
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
I'm a hard-ass.

262
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
And I'm a wuss.We should be partners.

263
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
Hard-ass and wuss.We could fight crime.

264
00:14:53 --> 00:14:54
Wait a minute, Phoebe.

265
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
We should be partners.

266
00:14:56 --> 00:14:57
We should be catering partners.

267
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
You're not working now,and we have a great time together.

268
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
I cook and you take careof the money.

269
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07

270
00:15:11 --> 00:15:12

271
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14

272
00:15:15 --> 00:15:15

284

292
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
I just knew thatsometimes when you're writing...

293
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
...you don't alwaysknow the exact time.

294
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32

295
00:16:33 --> 00:16:34

296
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
"The Velveteen Rabbit"?

297
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
I have a feeling you hadsomething to do with it.

298
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
What do you mean?

299
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
When Joey gave it to me he said:

300
00:16:41 --> 00:16:46
"This is because I know you likerabbits, and I know you like cheese."

301
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
Thanks. I love it.

302
00:16:48 --> 00:16:52
I know how hardit must have been for you to find.

303
00:16:52 --> 00:16:55
In case you missed that,that sound was, "Oh, well."

304
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
You must really like Joeyto go to all that trouble.

305
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
Oh, yeah. He's my...

306
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
He's my best friend.

307
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
Good night.

308
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

309
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
You don't know me.I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

310
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
You know, it's too badthat didn't work out.

311
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
Anyway, he told meabout your apartment.

312
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
Well, I couldn't sleepthinking about it.

313
00:17:39 --> 00:17:43
