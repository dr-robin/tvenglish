1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:07
Wait. Before we go in, I justwant you to know that I love you.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
I had a great time on our honeymoon.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
I can't waitto spend our life together.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
You're sticking withthe shell necklace, huh?

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
You're back!

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
Come on in!

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
How was the honeymoon?

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
So much fun. The best part is,we met this great couple.

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
That was the best part?Good honeymooning, tiger.

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
They're cool.It was their honeymoon too.

11
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
They live here in the city.

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
Can we go call them?Is it too soon to call?

13
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
We're excited. We finallyhave a couple to hang out with.

14
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
A couple? Like two people?Like one, two people?

15
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
It's different.Greg and Jenny are married.

16
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Greg and Jenny?"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler."

17
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny.""Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."

18
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
- They're great. If you just...- You know what?

19
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
Give us our souvenirsand get out of here.

20
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
- We didn't get a chance to...- You're kidding!

21
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
- We didn't get anything for anyone.- Nice necklace.

22
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
That you can have.

26
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
- Welcome home.- How was the honeymoon?

27
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
Great! How about you?You're having a baby!

28
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
- Look, I have a sonogram picture.- Good.

29
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.

30
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen?When? How many times?

31
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
Monica, that's not right.Start with where.

32
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
It happened about six weeks ago.

33
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
I got home and Ross was there.He'd been hanging out with Joey.

34
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
You're welcome, buddy.

35
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Yeah, thanks.

36
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
I had a lot of work,and Ross offered to help.

37
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
We had wine, we got to talking.

38
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
Next thing you know,Ross comes on to me.

39
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
That's a little misleading.

40
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
- What is?- The lie you just told.

41
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
- That you came on to me?- There's the one!

42
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
- But you did. Let's be honest.- Yes, let's.

43
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
It's not important.

44
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
What's important is, we're havinga baby, not who came on to who.

45
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
"Whom."

46
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
That's right.

47
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
- You kissed me first.- You were begging for it!

48
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
You were sending me signals!

49
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
I was sending signals? Anyone thinkthat I'd send Ross begging signals?

50
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
Please, show of hands.

51
00:03:13 --> 00:03:17
It doesn't matter what people believe!It happened.

52
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21
Maybe I need to be more careful.Am I sending these signals now?

53
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
- You know what? Just drop it.- Show me how I begged you.

54
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
I can show you!I have it on videotape.

55
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
It's an expression.

56
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
I can't believehe taped them having sex.

57
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
Yeah. You gotta tell a girlbefore you tape her.

58
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
Such a rookie mistake.

59
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
- Know who has a great camera?- Greg and Jenny?

60
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
- I want to call them.- Let's call.

61
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
Ask them if they broughttheir friends souvenirs.

62
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
8th Street Deli?

63
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
Hang up. You get food poisoningjust talking to that place.

64
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
- Sorry, wrong number.- Here you go, babe.

65
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
Hello?It's the deli again!

66
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
All right, I'll have a sandwich.

67
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
I don't think this number's right.

68
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
- What?- You got fake-numbered.

69
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
- What? People don't do that.- Oh, I think we do.

70
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
- Why would they do that?- I don't know.

71
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
You were a delight.You asked those great questions.

72
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
And you were never funnier.Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!

73
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
You still got me and Phoebe.

74
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
Excuse me, I don't wantGreg and Jenny's rejects.

75
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
Rachel won't talk to me.She won't open the door.

76
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
I wonder why, pervert.

77
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Okay, I am not a pervert.

78
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
That's, like, the pervert motto.

79
00:04:55 --> 00:05:00
You raise your hand, put your lefthand down your pants and repeat that.

80
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
Filming Rachel was not planned.

81
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
Here's what happened.Joey can back me up.

82
00:05:05 --> 00:05:09
A month and a half ago, rememberI came to you with a problem?

83
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
The personal thing?

84
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
- What personal thing?- About sex?

85
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
That I hadn't had sex in months?

86
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
Yeah, I knew whatyou were talking about.

87
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
I'd like to talk about somethingI'm uncomfortable talking about.

88
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Sure.

89
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40
How about you showeringwith your mom?

90
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
I actually had a topic in mind.

91
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
I'm kind of going througha dry spell, sex-wise.

92
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
- For, like, months?- Five, to be...

93
00:05:53 --> 00:05:54
...lying. Six.

94
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
Six months? That's rough.

95
00:05:57 --> 00:06:01
It's not all bad. I'm learning toappreciate the small things, like...

96
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
...the sound of a birdand the color of the sky.

97
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
The sky's blue, Ross.And I had sex yesterday.

98
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Please help me.I have a date tonight.

99
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
It has to go well.I'm scared for my health.

100
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
I got something.It's this story that I came up with.

101
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
Very romantic.Any woman that hears it is putty.

102
00:06:22 --> 00:06:23
Tell it to me.

103
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
Now, you're gonna want to have sexwith me when you hear it.

104
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
Remember, it is just the story.

105
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
I'll try to control myself.

106
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
Years ago, I was backpackingacross Western Europe...

107
00:06:39 --> 00:06:44
- You were backpacking across Europe?- Have a nice six more months.

108
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
I'm sorry. Please, please.You were in Western Europe, and...?

109
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
I was outside Barcelona, hikingin the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

110
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
I was at the end of this path,and there was a lake.

111
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
Very secluded.There were tall trees all around.

112
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
It was dead silent.Gorgeous.

113
00:07:06 --> 00:07:11
And across the lake I sawa beautiful woman bathing herself.

114
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
But she was crying.

115
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
Why?

116
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
This is great wine.

117
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
It's from France.

118
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
In Europe.

119
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
Western Europe.

120
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
A few years ago I was backpackingacross Western Europe.

121
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
- Really?- Wait, it gets better.

122
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
Yeah, I was in Barcelona.

123
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
I studied for a year in Barcelona.

124
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
- Anyway, so I was hiking...- I love hiking!

125
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
Oh, that's great!

126
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
I was hiking along the foothillsof Mount Tibidaybo...

127
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
- I think it's "Tibidabo."- Do you want to tell the story?

128
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
How'd your date go?

129
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
Great. I'm across the streethaving sex right now.

130
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
- Your story sucks.- Then you didn't tell it right.

131
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
- Show me how you did it.- No, I don't want to.

132
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
- How long since you seen a girl naked?- I was backpacking...

133
00:08:22 --> 00:08:27
- I'm not feeling it.- I was outside Barcelona, hiking...

134
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
- Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?- It's been six months. I'm always hot.

135
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
You're not selling the story.You don't believe it.

136
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
I gotta go, I got a date.But try this.

137
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
Do what I do before an audition.

138
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
Use my camera to record yourselfand see what you're doing wrong.

139
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
I'll try that.

140
00:08:45 --> 00:08:50
Now, you're all set up. Good to go.Just hit record. Good luck.

141
00:08:50 --> 00:08:55
If you ever have any problem with theladies, you know I'll help you out.

142
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
That means a lot to me, man.

143
00:09:16 --> 00:09:20
Can I get you anything?Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?

144
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
Ross, thank God you're here.You have to help me.

145
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Were you talking to yourself?

146
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
That's less embarrassing.Yes. Yes, I was.

147
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
I totally forgot about the camera.

148
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
It kept rollingand recorded everything.

149
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
Yeah, we're gonna needto see that tape.

150
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
What a great idea!That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

151
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
It's not fair to her.Let's forget the tape.

152
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
Thank you.

153
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
- No.- You're right.

154
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
- Joey, no.- Loud and clear.

155
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
I don't get whythey'd give us a fake number.

156
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
If they knew what they were doing,they didn't give you real names.

157
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
Maybe people give out fake numbers,but not fake names.

158
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
Hi. Ken Adams.Nice to meet you.

159
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
Regina Phalange.

160
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
- We didn't do anything wrong.- I know.

161
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
Although you did tellan awful lot of jokes.

162
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
You said they were funny.Joke, joke, joke!

163
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
Joke, joke, blah-blah.

164
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
- It was your questions.- What about them?

165
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
The sheer volume.It was like flying with the Riddler.

166
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
- Was that another joke?- Was that another question?

167
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Is Ross still here?

168
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
No, but he told us what happened.It was an honest mistake.

169
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
How would you like it if I had sexwith you and I taped it?

170
00:11:01 --> 00:11:02
Oh, forget it.

171
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
There he is, the father of my child,the porn king of the West Village.

172
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
It was an accident, okay?

173
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
I feel bad.I swear, I didn't even watch it.

174
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
Anyway, here.

175
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
You might be more comfortabledestroying it yourself.

176
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
Thank you.

177
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
What?

178
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
- You don't want to see this, do you?- Hell, yeah!

179
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
I am not gonna show you this.

180
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
Not the sex part.Just the stuff leading up to it.

181
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
Forget it.

182
00:11:41 --> 00:11:45
We'll think of another way to put the"who came on to who" thing to rest.

183
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
Come on now, think!

184
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
It's Rachel's tape,and she can do whatever she wants.

185
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
And she wants to destroy it,so end of story.

186
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
- I want to see it.- What?

187
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
You don't want us to see this.

188
00:12:01 --> 00:12:06
You so badly don't want us to see itthat it makes me want to see it.

189
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
Are we watching the tape or not?

190
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
- It's for your sake.- I don't believe you.

191
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
I think you don't want themto see you begging me.

192
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
- Rachel, please?- Oh, a little preview.

193
00:12:24 --> 00:12:28
Fine. I want the record to showthat I tried to take the high road.

194
00:12:28 --> 00:12:33
Because in about five minutes,I'm gonna be saying...

195
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
Okay, here we go.

196
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
I'm so happy.

197
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
Were you talking to yourself?

198
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
- There I am.- You're gonna get pregnant.

199
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
I screwed up so bad.

200
00:12:55 --> 00:12:59
those wedding invitations weeks ago.

201
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
You didn 't do it?

202
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
and forgot about them until today.

203
00:13:07 --> 00:13:12
Sweetie, it's okay. Everybody made itto the wedding. I'm fine.

204
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
- Kind of hurting my hand though.- I know.

205
00:13:15 --> 00:13:20
Monica went on and on about it.

206
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
"Here are the invitations", "Rachel.""Be very careful", "Rachel."

207
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27

00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
Not on the ones we sent out.

210
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
So just the ones you gave back to usand we had framed?

211
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56

212
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
I know.

213
00:13:58 --> 00:14:02
How you and I almost...

214

216
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
You think we would have done it?

217
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
I just wasn 't sure if you did.

218
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
"Oh", "I wanted to."

219
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21

220
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24

So, people are familiarwith the Europe story?

236
