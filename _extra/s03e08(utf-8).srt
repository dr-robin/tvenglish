00:00:02.95,00:00:04.31

17

Here you go, Pheebs.

18



19

00:00:04.51,00:00:07.03

20

Who wants one of my[br]special home-baked brownies?

21



22

00:00:07.23,00:00:08.22

23

I'll have one.

24



25

00:00:10.67,00:00:12.63

26

-That's okay.[br]-I'm not having one.

27



28

00:00:13.31,00:00:15.22

29

No, no. It's just my tooth.

30



31

00:00:15.47,00:00:17.23

32

-All right.[br]-I'll have one.

33



34

00:00:18.31,00:00:20.75

35

So you need a dentist?[br]I've got a good one.

36



37

00:00:20.99,00:00:25.03

38

Thanks. I have a good one too.[br]I just can't see him.

39



40

00:00:25.27,00:00:27.95

41

See, that is the problem[br]with invisible dentists.

42



43

00:00:29.71,00:00:30.86

44

Why can't you go to him?

45



46

00:00:31.11,00:00:35.79

47

Because every time I go[br]to the dentist, somebody dies.

48



49

00:00:37.07,00:00:39.79

50

That's so weird.[br]Every time I go to the dentist. . .

51



52

00:00:39.99,00:00:42.03

53

. . .I look down the hygienist's blouse.

54



55

00:00:45.43,00:00:46.42

56

What?

57



58

00:00:46.67,00:00:48.23

59

First it was my Aunt Mary.

60



61

00:00:48.47,00:00:50.75

62

And then there was John, my mailman.

63



64

00:00:50.99,00:00:53.55

65

And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.

66



67

00:00:54.71,00:00:56.83

68

And all these people actually died?

69



70

00:00:57.03,00:00:59.02

71

Yes. While I was in the chair.

72



73

00:00:59.23,00:01:02.35

74

That's why I take care of my teeth.[br]It's not about oral hygiene.

75



76

00:01:02.59,00:01:04.50

77

I floss to save lives.

78



79

00:01:05.51,00:01:07.27

80

Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

81



82

00:01:07.51,00:01:11.03

83

These people just happened to die[br]when you went to the dentist.

84



85

00:01:11.23,00:01:12.63

86

It's just a coincidence.

87



88

00:01:12.83,00:01:15.47

89

Tell that to them.[br]Oh, you can't! They're dead!

97

00:02:04.79,00:02:06.19

98

Thanks, Gunther.

99



100

00:02:07.19,00:02:08.63

101

Can I get a napkin too?

102



103

00:02:08.83,00:02:11.43

104

Oh, like you don't already[br]have everything.

105



106

00:02:16.59,00:02:19.95

107

You're in pain. Would you just[br]go to the dentist? Just go.

108



109

00:02:20.19,00:02:22.07

110

Fine. But if you're my next victim. . .

111



112

00:02:22.31,00:02:25.59

113

. . .don't come back as a poltergeist[br]who sucks me into the Tv set.

114



115

00:02:26.51,00:02:27.34

116

I promise.

117



118

00:02:27.59,00:02:29.39

119

Although, don't feel[br]like you can't visit.

120



121

00:02:31.87,00:02:33.59

122

Hey, is Chandler here?

123



124

00:02:35.59,00:02:37.03

125

No. No, he's not.

126



127

00:02:38.47,00:02:42.91

128

You guys, Joey just saw[br]Janice kissing her ex-husband.

129



130

00:02:43.11,00:02:44.15

131

What?

132



133

00:02:44.39,00:02:47.23

134

What are you gonna do?[br]How are you gonna tell Chandler?

135



136

00:02:47.47,00:02:50.55

137

I was thinking about that.[br]I think the best way would be. . .

138



139

00:02:50.79,00:02:51.67

140

. . .to not.

141



142

00:02:52.67,00:02:55.67

143

Joey, if you know about this,[br]you have to tell him.

144



145

00:02:55.91,00:02:58.03

146

It'll kill him.[br]It'll just kill him.

147



148

00:02:58.27,00:03:00.99

149

Wait till I go to the dentist.[br]Maybe I'll kill him.

150



151

00:03:06.31,00:03:11.23

152

I think Naked Guy's using a hammock.[br]It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

153



154

00:03:11.99,00:03:14.06

155

I'm going to the dentist.[br]So listen. . .

156



157

00:03:14.31,00:03:18.23

158

. . .just be on the lookout for anything[br]that you could fall into. . .

159



160

00:03:18.47,00:03:20.94

161

. . .or that can fall on you. . .

162



163

00:03:21.19,00:03:21.99

164

: : :or: : : :

165



166

00:03:22.47,00:03:24.03

167

All right, just look out!

168



169

00:03:25.91,00:03:27.51

170

And I also just want to. . . .

171



172

00:03:28.11,00:03:30.91

173

I just want to tell you all that. . . .

174



175

00:03:36.23,00:03:39.23

176

I have a problem. I have to go[br]into work for a few hours.

177



178

00:03:39.47,00:03:42.11

179

Some kids messed up[br]the Homo sapien display.

180



181

00:03:42.31,00:03:43.22

182

What did they do?

183



184

00:03:43.43,00:03:46.39

185

They painted over the word[br]"sapien," for one thing.

186



187

00:03:47.27,00:03:51.90

188

Then they rearranged the figures.[br]Let's just leave it at that.

189



190

00:03:52.39,00:03:54.27

191

Do you want me to watch Ben for you?

192



193

00:03:54.51,00:03:56.42

194

That's what I was gonna ask.[br]Thank you.

195



196

00:03:56.63,00:03:58.51

197

Wait, hello![br]What about me?

198



199

00:03:58.71,00:04:01.99

200

You. You want to watch Ben?

201



202

00:04:06.19,00:04:08.63

203

That would be great![br]I just asked Monica. . .

204



205

00:04:08.87,00:04:10.91

206

. . .because I know how empty[br]her life is.

207



208

00:04:16.19,00:04:17.67

209

I got a science question.

210



211

00:04:17.91,00:04:22.62

212

If the Homo sapiens were, in fact,[br]"homo" sapiens. . .

213



214

00:04:24.71,00:04:26.23

215

. . .is that why they're extinct?

216



217

00:04:29.91,00:04:32.95

218

Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

219



220

00:04:33.19,00:04:34.42

221

Hey, I'm not judging.

222



223

00:04:37.31,00:04:38.79

224

Look, Benny! Spoon!

225



226

00:04:39.71,00:04:40.78

227

Spoon!

228



229

00:04:42.87,00:04:45.83

230

Come on. All right, you know what?[br]I think he's bored.

231



232

00:04:46.31,00:04:48.43

233

Here. You wanna play[br]the airplane game?

234



235

00:04:48.67,00:04:50.35

236

You wanna show Rachel?[br]Come here.

237



238

00:04:50.59,00:04:52.71

239

You wanna do something fun? Okay.

240



241

00:05:03.51,00:05:06.43

242

You're so brave.[br]You're so brave! Yes, you are.

243



244

00:05:06.67,00:05:08.43

245

-You're so brave.[br]-You're okay.

246



247

00:05:08.67,00:05:10.74

248

He's fine.[br]Let's just put him down.

249



250

00:05:10.99,00:05:13.67

251

Come here, babe.[br]Yes, you're such a good boy.

252



253

00:05:13.91,00:05:17.95

254

How could you do that to him?![br]Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

255



256

00:05:18.19,00:05:20.07

257

Nothing, because we're not[br]telling him.

258



259

00:05:20.31,00:05:21.27

260

-We're not?[br]-No.

261



262

00:05:21.51,00:05:22.95

263

All right, I like that.

264



265

00:05:24.23,00:05:26.27

266

So we're okay.[br]We're okay, aren't we?

267



268

00:05:26.51,00:05:28.63

269

No, we're not okay.[br]There's a bump.

270



271

00:05:28.83,00:05:29.87

272

What bump?

273



274

00:05:30.11,00:05:32.63

275

Oh, my God! Well, push it in![br]Push it in!

276



277

00:05:32.83,00:05:34.98

278

I cannot push it in!

279



280

00:05:36.23,00:05:38.22

281

Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.

282



283

00:05:38.43,00:05:39.55

284

That's it.

285



286

00:05:39.79,00:05:40.75

287

I got it!

288



289

00:05:41.07,00:05:42.63

290

The second Ross walks in. . .

291



292

00:05:42.83,00:05:45.43

293

. . .take him to your bedroom[br]and do whatever you do. . .

294



295

00:05:45.67,00:05:47.50

296

. . .that makes him go "rheeeee! "

297



298

00:05:49.39,00:05:50.27

299

Or. . .

300



301

00:05:52.27,00:05:54.15

302

. . .we could put a hat on his head.

303



304

00:05:54.39,00:05:58.99

305

A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where[br]are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

306



307

00:05:59.19,00:06:00.67

308

I'll get Rainy Day Bear!

309



310

00:06:00.91,00:06:03.03

311

Because he'll know what to do?

312



313

00:06:03.51,00:06:05.07

314

Oh, my God.[br]You're a genius!

315



316

00:06:05.31,00:06:06.95

317

It's kind of sewn on.

318



319

00:06:07.19,00:06:08.31

320

Give it. Give it.

321



322

00:06:13.07,00:06:16.03

323

It's just like a bloodbath[br]in here today!

324



325

00:06:21.03,00:06:23.55

326

Hey, hold on a second.[br]Hold on a second.

327



328

00:06:24.83,00:06:27.11

329

Do you think these pearls are nice?

330



331

00:06:27.31,00:06:29.03

332

I'd prefer a mountain bike.

333



334

00:06:30.39,00:06:34.02

335

Janice's birthday's coming.[br]I wanna get her something special.

336



337

00:06:34.99,00:06:36.90

338

-Come in here with me.[br]-Wait!

339



340

00:06:39.47,00:06:41.86

341

You wanna get her something special?[br]Get her flowers.

342



343

00:06:42.11,00:06:44.47

344

Get her candy. Get her gum.[br]Girls love gum.

345



346

00:06:45.07,00:06:48.46

347

That's a good idea. "Dear Janice:[br]Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. "

348



349

00:06:49.87,00:06:52.26

350

I'd like to get her something serious.

351



352

00:06:52.51,00:06:54.50

353

You want something serious.

354



355

00:06:54.75,00:06:57.75

356

You know what you should do?[br]You should get her one of those. . .

357



358

00:06:57.99,00:06:59.51

359

. . .barium enemas.

360



361

00:07:01.63,00:07:03.35

362

Those are dead serious.

363



364

00:07:03.71,00:07:07.95

365

Look, I'm gonna go in here.[br]And you don't buy me anything, ever!

366



367

00:07:08.19,00:07:10.63

368

You can't! You can't.[br]You can't buy her pearls.

369



370

00:07:10.87,00:07:13.18

371

You just can't, you can't,[br]you can't!

372



373

00:07:13.39,00:07:14.51

374

Why not?

375



376

00:07:16.51,00:07:17.34

377

Oh, God.

378



379

00:07:19.51,00:07:20.58

380

Here's the thing.

381



382

00:07:21.87,00:07:23.67

383

This is the thing.[br]Okay, the thing is--

384



385

00:07:23.91,00:07:25.11

386

What is the thing?

387



388

00:07:26.79,00:07:29.83

389

I went down to the[br]Mattress King's showroom. . .

390



391

00:07:30.07,00:07:32.87

392

. . .and I saw Janice kissing[br]her ex-husband.

393



394

00:07:34.67,00:07:35.63

395

What?

396



397

00:07:36.19,00:07:37.83

398

They were in his office.

399



400

00:07:40.87,00:07:43.63

401

She wouldn't do that.[br]She's with me.

402



403

00:07:43.91,00:07:45.43

404

I'm telling you, I saw it.

405



406

00:07:45.63,00:07:47.43

407

Well, you're wrong.[br]You're wrong.

408



409

00:07:47.67,00:07:49.11

410

I'm not wrong.

411



412

00:07:49.31,00:07:50.79

413

I wish I was.

414



415

00:07:53.11,00:07:54.39

416

I'm sorry.

417



418

00:07:58.51,00:08:01.03

419

Bet that barium enema[br]doesn't sound so bad now.

420



421

00:08:03.51,00:08:08.22

422

It makes more sense as an ensemble.[br]And it takes the focus off the hat.

423



424

00:08:09.19,00:08:11.71

425

Oh! You're alive![br]You're alive!

426



427

00:08:13.35,00:08:15.74

428

I promised you no one[br]would die, didn't l?

429



430

00:08:15.99,00:08:19.27

431

We'll see about that. Can I use your[br]phone to call everyone I know?

432



433

00:08:19.51,00:08:21.66

434

Sure. We have no money. Go ahead.

435



436

00:08:23.39,00:08:26.03

437

Hey, you're not dead![br]Okay, see you.

438



439

00:08:28.59,00:08:30.07

440

Monica.

441



442

00:08:30.51,00:08:32.82

443

Oh, my God! He just said my name!

444



445

00:08:33.07,00:08:34.39

446

Did you hear that?

447



448

00:08:35.47,00:08:37.23

449

Monica bang!

450



451

00:08:40.39,00:08:41.95

452

Okay, I heard that.

453



454

00:08:42.87,00:08:44.86

455

Did he just say, "Monica bang"?

456



457

00:08:45.11,00:08:47.83

458

Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out!

459



460

00:08:48.51,00:08:50.03

461

Monica bang!

462



463

00:08:51.47,00:08:54.62

464

Sweetie, you need to stop[br]saying that now.

465



466

00:08:54.83,00:08:57.22

467

It's no big deal.[br]It's not even worth mentioning.

468



469

00:08:57.47,00:08:59.43

470

You see? We all do it all the time.

471



472

00:08:59.67,00:09:00.95

473

See? Watch this.

474



475

00:09:02.87,00:09:05.55

476

Monica bang![br]Everybody bang!

477



478

00:09:05.91,00:09:06.82

479

Ben bang!

480



481

00:09:07.07,00:09:08.39

482

Rachel bang!

483



484

00:09:08.91,00:09:10.82

485

Bang, Rachel! Bang!

486



487

00:09:11.39,00:09:13.70

488

-Oh, isn't it fun?[br]-Look at that!

489



490

00:09:14.23,00:09:15.06

491

We all do it!

492



493

00:09:15.71,00:09:18.10

494

-Okay, I'm stopping now.[br]-Are you okay?

495



496

00:09:18.51,00:09:22.11

497

You know, if it's not[br]a headboard, it's just not worth it.

498



499

00:09:32.67,00:09:34.79

500

How's my Bing-a-ling?

501



502

00:09:38.51,00:09:39.55

503

I don't know.

504



505

00:09:40.27,00:09:41.59

506

You tell me.

507



508

00:09:42.63,00:09:45.02

509

Anything you want to tell me?

510



511

00:09:45.71,00:09:47.31

512

Because if you. . . .[br]You should--

513



514

00:09:47.55,00:09:49.54

515

You would tell me.

516



517

00:09:51.07,00:09:53.87

518

Why are your eyes so wide?

519



520

00:09:54.51,00:09:55.66

521

You tell me.

522



523

00:09:56.63,00:09:59.63

524

Maybe it's because I was just[br]fooling around with my ex.

525



526

00:09:59.87,00:10:01.59

527

Oh, no. That was you!

528



529

00:10:01.91,00:10:02.87

530

Oh, my God!

531



532

00:10:03.11,00:10:04.87

533

-All right![br]-How did you know?

534



535

00:10:05.11,00:10:07.26

536

Joey told me. He saw you two kissing.

537



538

00:10:07.47,00:10:08.27

539

In the park?

540



541

00:10:09.99,00:10:12.67

542

No. In his office.[br]How many kisses were there?

543



544

00:10:12.91,00:10:13.87

545

Just those two!

546



547

00:10:14.11,00:10:15.47

548

Why?

549



550

00:10:15.71,00:10:18.31

551

Why was there kissing?[br]There should be no kissing!

552



553

00:10:18.55,00:10:21.59

554

Oh, I'm sorry, honey.[br]I'm so, so. . . .

555



556

00:10:22.31,00:10:24.30

557

I'm so, so sorry. I just. . . .

558



559

00:10:26.27,00:10:28.91

560

What happened was l. . . .[br]I can't breathe.

561



562

00:10:29.23,00:10:31.83

563

Can you get me a bag or something?

564



565

00:10:32.71,00:10:33.91

566

Here. Here.

567



568

00:10:38.67,00:10:39.50

569

It's the receipt.

570



571

00:10:39.75,00:10:40.66

572

I'll take it.

573



574

00:10:42.31,00:10:43.95

575

Look, I've got to know.

576



577

00:10:46.83,00:10:48.27

578

Are you finished with me?

579



580

00:10:51.03,00:10:52.71

581

Are you finished with him?

582



583

00:10:56.67,00:10:58.63

584

Do you still love him?

585



586

00:11:01.63,00:11:03.07

587

Do you still love me?

588



589

00:11:05.03,00:11:06.18

590

All right, look. . .

591



592

00:11:07.23,00:11:09.67

593

. . .I'm gonna need an actual[br]answer here, okay?

594



595

00:11:09.91,00:11:11.55

596

So which is it?

597



598

00:11:13.03,00:11:14.43

599

Him or me?

600



601

00:11:23.11,00:11:24.75

602

I don't know.

603



604

00:11:27.11,00:11:30.19

605

Okay, if you're alive,[br]you answer your phone!

606



607

00:11:35.79,00:11:39.99

608

Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy[br]that you had ice cream before dinner. . .

609



610

00:11:40.23,00:11:43.83

611

. . .if you won't tell him about[br]our little bonking incident.

612



613

00:11:44.03,00:11:47.23

614

Number one, I don't think Ben[br]understands the concept of bribery.

615



616

00:11:47.47,00:11:49.23

617

And number two, l--

618



619

00:11:51.35,00:11:52.15

620

What?

621



622

00:11:52.51,00:11:54.63

623

You said "number two. "

624



625

00:11:57.51,00:11:58.83

626

I also said "number one. "

627



628

00:11:59.63,00:12:00.51

629

I know.

630



631

00:12:03.31,00:12:04.35

632

Hey, everyone!

633



634

00:12:04.59,00:12:06.63

635

How's my little boy?

636



637

00:12:06.83,00:12:08.43

638

He's perfect.[br]Aren't you, Ben?

639



640

00:12:08.67,00:12:12.22

641

-He's never been better.[br]-What did you do, take him whaling?

642



643

00:12:14.31,00:12:15.27

644

Monica.

645



646

00:12:15.51,00:12:19.83

647

Oh, my God! He just said your name![br]That's great! Good job, Ben!

648



649

00:12:20.63,00:12:21.78

650

Monica bang!

651



652

00:12:23.11,00:12:24.02

653

That's right.

654



655

00:12:24.23,00:12:27.03

656

That's what I'd sound like[br]if I exploded.

657



658

00:12:28.91,00:12:31.35

659

The curse is broken![br]I called everybody I know. . .

660



661

00:12:31.59,00:12:33.42

662

. . .and everyone is alive!

663



664

00:12:38.47,00:12:41.11

665

Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

666



667

00:12:47.07,00:12:48.71

668

My God, I killed another one!

669



670

00:12:48.95,00:12:52.79

671

The curse is getting stronger too,[br]to bring down something that big.

672



673

00:12:53.11,00:12:54.94

674

Maybe he's just taking a nap.

675



676

00:12:55.19,00:12:57.63

677

I'm telling you,[br]he hasn't moved since this morning.

678



679

00:12:57.87,00:12:59.27

680

We should call somebody.

681



682

00:12:59.51,00:13:02.55

683

Tell them the naked guy we stare at[br]isn't moving?

684



685

00:13:02.79,00:13:04.86

686

We've got to find out if he's alive.

687



688

00:13:05.11,00:13:07.42

689

How are we gonna do that?[br]There's no way.

690



691

00:13:07.63,00:13:09.23

692

Well, there is one way.

693



694

00:13:09.51,00:13:12.15

695

His window's open.[br]I say. . .

696



697

00:13:12.39,00:13:13.54

698

. . .we poke him.

699



700

00:13:19.19,00:13:21.55

701

You know how we save[br]all those chopsticks. . .

702



703

00:13:21.79,00:13:24.23

704

. . .for no reason[br]when we get Chinese food?

705



706

00:13:25.63,00:13:27.51

707

Well, now we got a reason.

708



709

00:13:28.71,00:13:29.59

710

What?

711



712

00:13:29.83,00:13:32.71

713

We're fashioning a very long[br]poking device.

714



715

00:13:34.59,00:13:35.63

716

All right.

717



718

00:13:38.51,00:13:40.11

719

Hey, what's the matter?

720



721

00:13:43.03,00:13:44.67

722

I talked to Janice.

723



724

00:13:44.99,00:13:47.55

725

Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?

726



727

00:13:48.19,00:13:49.75

728

She doesn't know.

729



730

00:13:49.99,00:13:51.39

731

Says she loves us both.

732



733

00:13:53.03,00:13:55.59

734

I woke up this morning, I was in love.

735



736

00:13:55.91,00:13:57.43

737

I was happy!

738



739

00:13:59.11,00:14:01.75

740

It serves me right for buying[br]that 1 2-pack of condoms.

741



742

00:14:03.99,00:14:07.62

743

And now I can't even return them,[br]because she choked on the receipt!

744



745

00:14:10.71,00:14:12.86

746

What are you gonna do?

747



748

00:14:15.59,00:14:16.71

749

I don't know.

750



751

00:14:17.99,00:14:19.82

752

You know? What would you do?

753



754

00:14:22.31,00:14:23.95

755

It doesn't matter what I'd do.

756



757

00:14:24.19,00:14:25.87

758

Come on. Come on. Tell me.

759



760

00:14:28.67,00:14:30.11

761

All right. . .

762



763

00:14:31.51,00:14:33.34

764

. . .you probably won't want[br]to hear this. . .

765



766

00:14:36.47,00:14:39.59

767

. . .but if it was me,[br]and this is just me. . .

768



769

00:14:40.15,00:14:40.95

770

. . .I'd bow out.

771



772

00:14:41.15,00:14:41.95

773

What?

774



775

00:14:44.51,00:14:46.31

776

What are you talking about?

777



778

00:14:49.39,00:14:51.03

779

They have a kid together. . .

780



781

00:14:51.23,00:14:52.35

782

. . .you know?

783



784

00:14:53.83,00:14:55.51

785

They're, like, a family.

786



787

00:14:56.43,00:14:58.07

788

And if, I don't know. . .

789



790

00:14:58.31,00:15:01.54

791

. . .if there's a chance[br]they can make that work. . .

792



793

00:15:01.79,00:15:04.51

794

. . .I wouldn't want to be the guy[br]who stood in the way.

795



796

00:15:09.03,00:15:10.18

797

You okay?

798



799

00:15:14.15,00:15:15.83

800

You wanna come poke a nude guy?

801



802

00:15:18.91,00:15:21.27

803

Well, he's finally asleep.

804



805

00:15:21.91,00:15:24.67

806

About that bump on his head. . . .

807



808

00:15:25.91,00:15:28.14

809

Are you sure it's a new bump?

810



811

00:15:28.39,00:15:32.43

812

No offense, but I've always thought[br]of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

813



814

00:15:32.79,00:15:36.07

815

It's okay if he bumps his head.[br]Kids bump their heads all the time.

816



817

00:15:36.31,00:15:39.11

818

It was your first time babysitting.[br]You did your best.

819



820

00:15:39.63,00:15:40.62

821

I did!

822



823

00:15:40.83,00:15:41.63

824

I know.

825



826

00:15:41.83,00:15:44.03

827

You just have to watch them[br]all the time.

828



829

00:15:44.23,00:15:46.87

830

I did! I watched! I watched!

831



832

00:15:47.11,00:15:50.19

833

I watched Monica bang his head[br]against that thing!

834



835

00:15:51.27,00:15:52.18

836

Monica did it?

837



838

00:15:57.71,00:16:01.42

839

Did you notice anything weird[br]about Ben today?

840



841

00:16:02.67,00:16:03.63

842

No, why?

843



844

00:16:03.87,00:16:07.63

845

I was just playing with him, and we[br]were doing the "Alphabet Song" . . .

846



847

00:16:07.83,00:16:10.63

848

. . .which he's good at.[br]But he left out "E" and "F. "

849



850

00:16:10.87,00:16:14.39

851

It's like they just, I don't know,[br]fell out of his head.

852



853

00:16:16.79,00:16:17.83

854

Really?

855



856

00:16:18.03,00:16:21.07

857

Oh, and also, he's walking. . .

858



859

00:16:21.63,00:16:22.75

860

. . .kind of funny.

861



862

00:16:24.35,00:16:28.63

863

It's like his left leg is moving[br]a lot faster than his right leg.

864



865

00:16:28.87,00:16:30.55

866

Yeah, he's in there, just. . . .

867



868

00:16:34.27,00:16:36.95

869

Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!

871

00:16:39.79,00:16:42.15

872

I hope it's still funny[br]when you're in hell.

873



874

00:16:43.51,00:16:44.58

875

You jerk!

876



877

00:16:44.79,00:16:49.42

878

-You know how much I love that kid![br]-Monica bang! Monica bang!

879



880

00:16:52.63,00:16:53.95

881

I'll get the hat.

882



883

00:16:58.31,00:17:00.07

884

I have something to tell you.

885



886

00:17:00.31,00:17:02.43

887

And I want you to let me[br]get through it. . .

888



889

00:17:02.67,00:17:03.95

890

. . .because. . .

891



892

00:17:04.91,00:17:07.27

893

. . .it's not gonna be easy.

894



895

00:17:11.47,00:17:13.54

896

I think you should go back with Gary.

897



898

00:17:15.47,00:17:18.23

899

I don't want to be the guy[br]that breaks up a family.

900



901

00:17:19.03,00:17:22.34

902

You know, when my parents split up,[br]it was because of that guy.

903



904

00:17:22.59,00:17:24.66

905

Whenever I'd see him,[br]I'd always think. . .

906



907

00:17:24.91,00:17:28.27

908

. . . "You're the reason.[br]You are why they're not together. "

909



910

00:17:28.51,00:17:30.58

911

And I hated that guy.

912



913

00:17:32.43,00:17:37.11

914

And it didn't matter how nice he was[br]or how happy he made my dad.

915



916

00:17:47.31,00:17:48.99

917

It's the right thing to do.

918



919

00:17:50.11,00:17:51.31

920

You're right.

921



922

00:17:52.67,00:17:56.99

923

Oh, God.[br]But before I can say goodbye. . .

924



925

00:17:58.31,00:18:01.43

926

. . .there's something I really[br]need you to know.

927



928

00:18:01.91,00:18:04.43

929

The way I feel about you. . .

930



931

00:18:04.71,00:18:07.67

932

. . .it's like I finally understand. . .

933



934

00:18:07.91,00:18:10.14

935

. . .what Lionel Ritchie's[br]been singing about.

936



937

00:18:11.71,00:18:13.43

938

You know?[br]I mean, what we have. . .

939



940

00:18:13.67,00:18:16.47

941

. . .it's like movie love.

942



943

00:18:17.67,00:18:19.50

944

You're my soul mate.

945



946

00:18:20.51,00:18:24.63

947

I can't believe we're not gonna[br]spend the rest of our lives together.

948



949

00:18:26.39,00:18:27.99

950

Then don't leave me.

951



952

00:18:29.35,00:18:30.15

953

What?

954



955

00:18:30.39,00:18:33.23

956

Forget what I said! I was babbling![br]Pick me!

957



958

00:18:33.43,00:18:36.95

959

No, you were right! I gotta give[br]my marriage another chance.

960



961

00:18:37.59,00:18:38.99

962

No, you don't!

963



964

00:18:39.75,00:18:42.83

965

I say you have to give your divorce[br]another chance!

966



967

00:18:45.63,00:18:46.91

968

I'm sorry.

969



970

00:18:52.07,00:18:53.30

971

Don't go.

972



973

00:18:53.87,00:18:55.59

974

No, I gotta go.

975



976

00:18:59.87,00:19:01.19

977

Honey. Honey.

978



979

00:19:02.07,00:19:04.35

980

-People are looking.[br]-I don't care.

981



982

00:19:05.23,00:19:06.75

983

I don't care!

984



985

00:19:07.31,00:19:08.67

986

Yeah, okay.

987



988

00:19:10.07,00:19:11.30

989

I'm leaving now.

990



991

00:19:14.03,00:19:16.50

992

You can't leave! I have your shoe!

993



994

00:19:20.11,00:19:22.34

995

Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

996



997

00:19:33.35,00:19:35.03

998

Rachel has those in burgundy.

999



1000

00:19:38.67,00:19:43.19

1001

Remember, something this big and long[br]will be very difficult to maneuver.

1002



1003

00:19:43.39,00:19:46.03

1004

Fortunately, I have[br]experience in that area.

1005



1006

00:19:46.79,00:19:51.26

1007

Can we please focus here? A naked[br]man's life hangs in the balance.

1008



1009

00:19:51.51,00:19:52.83

1010

I'm telling you, he's dead.

1011



1012

00:19:53.03,00:19:56.34

1013

What we're about to have here[br]is a dead fat guy on a stick!

1014



1015

00:19:57.27,00:20:00.03

1016

All right, ladies and gentlemen,[br]let's poke.

1017



1018

00:20:00.23,00:20:01.06

1019

Steady.

1020



1021

00:20:01.31,00:20:02.43

1022

Steady.

1023



1024

00:20:03.11,00:20:04.39

1025

Okay, a little higher.

1026



1027

00:20:05.31,00:20:06.79

1028

Careful of the angle.

1029



1030

00:20:06.99,00:20:09.55

1031

Okay, okay.[br]We're approaching the window.

1032



1033

00:20:13.39,00:20:15.75

1034

Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

1035



1036

00:20:21.23,00:20:23.79

1037

He's alive! He's alive!

1038



1039

00:20:25.79,00:20:28.02

1040

And yet we're still poking him.

1041



1042

00:20:28.27,00:20:30.83

1043

Okay, retract the device![br]Retract the device!

1044



1045

00:20:31.35,00:20:33.23

1046

He does not look happy.

1047



1048

00:20:34.07,00:20:36.99

1049

Now he's showing us his poking device.

1050



1051

00:20:38.07,00:20:41.62

1052

Hey, that's never gonna make it[br]all the way over here, buddy!

1053



1054

00:20:47.91,00:20:52.27

1055

I'll hold you close in my arms

1056



1057

00:20:53.63,00:20:57.55

1058

I can 't resist your charms

1059



1060

00:20:58.51,00:21:00.03

1061

And love

1062



1063

00:21:00.23,00:21:02.03

1064

Love

1065



1066

00:21:03.43,00:21:08.14

1067

I'll be a fool for you

1068



1069

00:21:08.47,00:21:10.51

1070

I'm sure

1071



1072

00:21:11.71,00:21:14.75

1073

You know I don 't mind

1074



1075

00:21:14.99,00:21:17.55

1076

Oh, you know I don 't mind

1077



1078

00:21:18.11,00:21:19.63

1079

Yes

1080



1081

00:21:19.91,00:21:23.83

1082

You mean the world to me

1083



1084

00:21:24.47,00:21:27.43

1085

Oh, I know[br]I know

1086



1087

00:21:27.67,00:21:30.14

1088

I've found[br]I've found

1089



1090

00:21:30.39,00:21:31.71

1091

In you

1092



1093

00:21:33.11,00:21:36.55

1094

My endless love

1095



1096

00:21:38.99,00:21:42.07

1097

My endless love

1098
