20

I was supposed to call my dad back[br]two hours ago.

21



22

00:00:07.26,00:00:08.69

23

Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

24



25

00:00:08.94,00:00:11.81

26

Call him as soon as you get a chance.[br]He's at Flimbees.

27



28

00:00:12.34,00:00:13.21

29

What's Flimbees?

30



31

00:00:13.42,00:00:16.29

32

That's the word I use when[br]I can't remember the real thing.

33



34

00:00:17.86,00:00:20.09

35

Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

36



37

00:00:20.30,00:00:22.33

38

No. That's what they want me to do.

39



40

00:00:22.58,00:00:25.09

41

My warranty expires tomorrow.[br]If I don't get through. . .

42



43

00:00:25.30,00:00:27.89

44

. . .they won't fix my crappy,[br]broken phone for free!

45



46

00:00:28.10,00:00:30.13

47

We cannot let them win![br]It's us versus them!

48



49

00:00:30.38,00:00:31.69

50

Yes!

51



52

00:00:35.26,00:00:38.29

53

I gotta double-check for tickets[br]tonight. Who got what?

54



55

00:00:38.54,00:00:39.49

56

I have one.

57



58

00:00:39.74,00:00:42.04

59

I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

62

My boyfriend.

63



64

00:00:45.54,00:00:47.57

65

I have a boyfriend now.

66



67

00:00:47.98,00:00:49.49

68

Two it is. How about you?

69



70

00:00:50.78,00:00:52.61

71

Yeah, I also need two.

72



73

00:00:53.38,00:00:55.13

74

Really? Who's number two?

75



76

00:00:55.38,00:00:59.69

77

Whose Number Two? One of the more[br]difficult games sewer workers play.

78



79

00:01:01.58,00:01:03.61

80

No, it's just this person.

81



82

00:01:03.98,00:01:05.57

83

Like a date-type person?

84



85

00:01:05.90,00:01:08.49

86

Yeah, kind of.[br]It's this woman from work.

87



88

00:01:08.74,00:01:11.49

89

I hope that won't be too weird.[br]Will it, Rach?

90



91

00:01:12.78,00:01:15.73

92

Not at all. I was actually[br]gonna bring someone myself.

93



94

00:01:16.14,00:01:18.13

95

But you said one ticket.

96



97

00:01:21.26,00:01:23.61

98

I meant me plus one.

99



100

00:01:24.14,00:01:26.65

101

Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

102



103

00:01:28.78,00:01:30.53

104

All right. I'll see you tonight.

105



106

00:01:30.78,00:01:31.69

107

Okay. Bye-bye.

108

00:01:31.94,00:01:32.85

110

Bye-bye.

111

00:01:33.74,00:01:34.85

113

Okay, I need a date!

114

00:01:36.78,00:01:40.09

116

Oh, hey! You guys are finally[br]gonna get to meet Kate!

117



118

00:01:40.30,00:01:42.76

119

And I borrowed your cologne.[br]I hope she likes it.

120



121

00:01:42.98,00:01:45.54

122

What are you doing?[br]She's seeing somebody.

123



124

00:01:45.78,00:01:47.97

125

Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

126

-Here you go. You can wear this.[br]-Thanks.

138



139

00:02:48.42,00:02:50.17

140

I'm setting the phone down.

141



142

00:02:51.34,00:02:52.65

143

But I'm still here.

144



145

00:02:53.66,00:02:55.89

146

Just don't go anywhere.[br]I'm still here.

147



148

00:02:56.34,00:03:00.25

149

Don't switch or anything, because[br]I'm right here. Just one sec.

150



151

00:03:01.66,00:03:03.65

152

One sec. One second!

153



154

00:03:04.14,00:03:06.25

155

Wait! One second! Just. . . .

156



157

00:03:06.94,00:03:08.85

158

What? Monica, I'm scared!

159



160

00:03:09.86,00:03:11.97

161

Honey, that's a sleeve.

162



163

00:03:13.14,00:03:15.60

164

And we also have a speakerphone.

165



166

00:03:15.86,00:03:18.93

167

Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is important to us.

168



169

00:03:19.18,00:03:21.09

170

You gotta hang up.[br]We'll be late.

171



172

00:03:21.30,00:03:23.89

173

Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

174



175

00:03:24.14,00:03:26.44

176

Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

177



178

00:03:26.94,00:03:29.29

179

You were gonna have me hang up.

180



181

00:03:32.78,00:03:34.93

182

Can you take a duck and a chick[br]to the theater?

183



184

00:03:36.30,00:03:37.61

185

Of course not.

186



187

00:03:37.94,00:03:40.61

188

I just wanted them to hear it[br]from somebody else.

189



190

00:03:48.90,00:03:50.49

191

Oh, hi, how are you?

192



193

00:03:50.74,00:03:51.77

194

Good.

195



196

00:03:53.54,00:03:56.33

197

-Looks like we're the first ones here.[br]-Looks that way.

198



199

00:03:56.58,00:03:57.69

200

First ones here!

201



202

00:04:01.18,00:04:03.69

203

Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.[br]Ross, Tommy.

204



205

00:04:03.90,00:04:06.09

206

Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin.[br]Cailin--

207



208

00:04:06.34,00:04:07.25

209

Sorry.

210



211

00:04:07.86,00:04:08.89

212

And break!

213



214

00:04:12.98,00:04:15.36

215

I think I'm gonna run[br]to the ladies' room.

216



217

00:04:15.58,00:04:17.69

218

-I'll join you.[br]-I'll get our seats.

219



220

00:04:19.98,00:04:21.37

221

Well, this is. . .

222



223

00:04:21.62,00:04:22.68

224

. . .awkward.

225



226

00:04:24.30,00:04:26.89

227

Well, because Rachel and I[br]used to go out.

228



229

00:04:27.14,00:04:28.73

230

Oh, I didn't know that.

231



232

00:04:30.94,00:04:33.53

233

Well, then this is awkward.

234



235

00:04:35.18,00:04:37.64

236

-So what do you. . .?[br]-I think we're here.

237



238

00:04:39.90,00:04:41.69

239

Excuse me. I'm sorry.

240



241

00:04:41.90,00:04:44.01

242

I think you may be in our seats.

243



244

00:04:45.78,00:04:47.25

245

No, I don't think so.

246



247

00:04:47.46,00:04:49.89

248

-Could we take a look at your ticket?[br]-Sure.

249



250

00:04:51.78,00:04:54.41

251

Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" . . . .

252



253

00:04:55.54,00:04:57.09

254

Oh, well, I thought that--

255



256

00:04:57.30,00:05:00.81

257

You thought? Well, that didn't[br]really work out for you. Idiot!

258



259

00:05:02.50,00:05:05.85

260

What are you, a moron?[br]It says, "D-1 3" ! Okay?

261



262

00:05:06.18,00:05:09.09

263

You're surrounded by even numbers![br]Does that give you a clue?

264



265

00:05:09.58,00:05:12.21

266

-The usher told me--[br]-The usher must be right!

267



268

00:05:12.46,00:05:14.09

269

With all his training!

270



271

00:05:14.54,00:05:15.60

272

Get out!

273



274

00:05:16.58,00:05:17.45

275

Here!

276



277

00:05:21.06,00:05:23.49

278

-Hey, man, you want the aisle?[br]-No, I'm good.

279



280

00:05:35.26,00:05:37.13

281

-There he is![br]-There's our star!

282



283

00:05:37.38,00:05:38.89

284

You were great!

285



286

00:05:39.10,00:05:40.29

287

So? What'd you think?

288



289

00:05:40.58,00:05:44.28

290

Almost as good as the play with[br]the two naked girls on the seesaw.

291



292

00:05:45.18,00:05:47.09

293

-I wasn't in that.[br]-I know.

294



295

00:05:48.06,00:05:51.13

296

I want you to meet everybody.[br]Everybody, this is Kate.

297



298

00:05:51.38,00:05:53.68

299

Excuse me. Excuse me.[br]Sweetheart!

300



301

00:05:56.54,00:05:57.49

302

Come!

303



304

00:06:01.14,00:06:03.29

305

So that's the girl you like.

306



307

00:06:05.38,00:06:07.94

308

I tell you, this guy[br]Rachel is with is crazy.

309



310

00:06:08.18,00:06:12.77

311

He viciously screamed at total[br]strangers. I think he's bad news.

312



313

00:06:14.26,00:06:17.65

314

Wait a minute. You don't like[br]the guy Rachel's dating?

315



316

00:06:18.06,00:06:19.12

317

Well, that's odd.

318



319

00:06:20.62,00:06:24.53

320

Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is[br]Kate's understudy, Lauren.

321



322

00:06:24.78,00:06:26.69

323

Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

324



325

00:06:26.94,00:06:29.53

326

I ran into you in the hallway[br]in your building.

327



328

00:06:29.78,00:06:33.48

329

It was right after I slept with Joey.[br]He dumped me the next day.

330



331

00:06:35.18,00:06:37.05

332

So how'd you guys meet?

333



334

00:06:37.90,00:06:41.13

335

The short version is, I pursued[br]her for a couple of months.

336



337

00:06:41.38,00:06:44.33

338

Then I gave her a check for $20,000[br]and she was mine.

339



340

00:06:45.98,00:06:50.29

341

In the long version, I dump him[br]for telling people the short version.

342



343

00:06:51.06,00:06:53.41

344

Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

345



346

00:06:54.98,00:06:56.93

347

You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

348



349

00:06:57.18,00:06:58.29

350

How do you do?

351



352

00:06:58.50,00:07:01.45

353

Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

354



355

00:07:01.98,00:07:03.97

356

Do they have representation?

357



358

00:07:04.90,00:07:06.57

359

They weren't in the play.

360



361

00:07:06.90,00:07:08.12

362

We're not actors.

363



364

00:07:08.46,00:07:09.33

365

What a shame!

366



367

00:07:09.78,00:07:13.73

368

With her face and her chest,[br]I could really put something together.

369



370

00:07:15.90,00:07:17.21

371

Could I borrow it?

372



373

00:07:19.58,00:07:21.33

374

Hi. Remember me?

375



376

00:07:22.06,00:07:24.62

377

Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line[br]for the bathroom. . .

378



379

00:07:24.86,00:07:27.77

380

. . .and someone just cut.[br]I think he's gonna snap.

381



382

00:07:29.30,00:07:30.49

383

I'm gonna go.

384



385

00:07:30.86,00:07:32.08

386

Go? Why?

387



388

00:07:32.30,00:07:34.97

389

I don't know. Could be[br]because I don't feel like. . .

390



391

00:07:35.22,00:07:38.21

392

. . .waiting all night for a guy[br]who may or may not scream.

393



394

00:07:40.70,00:07:42.73

395

He definitely will scream.

396



397

00:07:43.98,00:07:45.09

398

Goodbye.

399



400

00:07:49.14,00:07:50.69

401

Here we go, people!

Joey Tribbiani gives[br]an uneven performance.

413

But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst[br]thing in this production. "

Yes!

Here it is! "The direction. . .

You've ruined my life.

441



442

00:08:51.06,00:08:52.93

443

Does anyone mind if I save this?

444



445

00:08:58.26,00:09:00.05

446

-Is the play over?[br]-Where were you?

447



448

00:09:00.58,00:09:04.09

449

Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

450



451

00:09:04.50,00:09:07.89

452

You were "the next caller" hours ago.[br]You must be going crazy.

453



454

00:09:08.14,00:09:10.21

455

I've kept myself busy.

456



457

00:09:18.30,00:09:22.29

458

Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in[br]her room and her stuff in your room.

459



460

00:09:28.30,00:09:29.13

461

You okay?

462



463

00:09:30.50,00:09:31.37

464

Fabulous.

465



466

00:09:31.70,00:09:36.33

467

Drama critics, they're nothing but[br]people who couldn't make it as actors.

468



469

00:09:36.58,00:09:38.81

470

-You know what to do?[br]-Become a drama critic.

471



472

00:09:43.58,00:09:44.89

473

I am hurt!

474



475

00:09:47.78,00:09:49.09

476

A plague. . .

477



478

00:09:49.46,00:09:51.57

479

. . .on both your houses!

480



481

00:09:54.06,00:09:57.49

482

By the way, he dumped me tonight[br]after he read my review.

483



484

00:09:57.70,00:09:59.41

485

Oh, classy.

486



487

00:10:01.50,00:10:03.33

488

I sure know how to pick them.

489



490

00:10:04.94,00:10:07.89

491

You know I gave up a part[br]on a soap for this?

492



493

00:10:10.30,00:10:11.57

494

I gave up a job too.

495



496

00:10:11.98,00:10:14.81

497

-Really? What?[br]-Declawing cats.

498



499

00:10:16.78,00:10:19.34

500

Hey, tell you what,[br]let me walk you home.

501



502

00:10:19.58,00:10:23.57

503

We'll stop by every newsstand and burn[br]every copy of The Times and The Post.

504



505

00:10:23.86,00:10:26.01

506

-Why The Post?[br]-You didn't see The Post?

507



508

00:10:26.26,00:10:28.93

509

-No. You?[br]-No. Why?

510



511

00:10:36.10,00:10:38.89

512

You really think these newspapers[br]are just jealous of me?

513



514

00:10:39.10,00:10:42.25

515

Absolutely. You're talented[br]and you're good-looking.

516



517

00:10:42.74,00:10:45.12

518

You're sweet and cute.

519



520

00:10:45.38,00:10:47.68

521

I know. That's why they trashed me.

522



523

00:10:54.66,00:10:56.65

524

-Wait. Wait a minute.[br]-What?

525



526

00:10:58.58,00:11:00.29

527

I don't get you.

528



529

00:11:00.50,00:11:02.37

530

I mean, first you hate me.

531



532

00:11:02.66,00:11:05.17

533

Then you sleep with me.

534



535

00:11:05.58,00:11:08.33

536

Then you want nothing to do with me.[br]Now you want me again?

537



538

00:11:08.58,00:11:11.04

539

You never went out[br]with an actress before?

540



541

00:11:12.50,00:11:15.09

542

Kate, do you even like me?

543



544

00:11:17.86,00:11:21.29

545

-Of course I do.[br]-So how come you blew me off?

546



547

00:11:21.54,00:11:24.81

548

-How come you were with him?[br]-I don't know.

549



550

00:11:25.46,00:11:27.13

551

I just do this.

552



553

00:11:27.66,00:11:30.53

554

I always have to pick, like,[br]the smartest guy. . .

555



556

00:11:30.78,00:11:32.29

557

. . .or the most talented guy.

558



559

00:11:33.58,00:11:35.88

560

Why can't I just[br]pick someone like you?

561



562

00:11:38.98,00:11:40.04

563

Thanks.

564



565

00:11:42.34,00:11:43.81

566

You know what I mean.

567



568

00:11:45.70,00:11:47.97

569

I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

570



571

00:11:49.46,00:11:51.01

572

You're just so. . . .

573



574

00:11:52.30,00:11:53.41

575

You're so. . .

576



577

00:11:54.70,00:11:55.61

578

: : :so: : : :

579



580

00:12:06.98,00:12:09.54

581

Here we go.[br]Let's get your feet up there.

582



583

00:12:17.06,00:12:18.41

584

Good night.

585



586

00:12:19.54,00:12:20.85

587

Sweet dreams.

588



589

00:12:27.38,00:12:30.69

590

I'm gonna put this can right here[br]in case you have to hurl.

591



592

00:12:38.78,00:12:42.69

593

Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is very important to us.

594



595

00:12:43.74,00:12:46.93

596

You've been up for 24 hours.[br]Go to sleep.

597



598

00:12:47.18,00:12:48.29

599

This isn't healthy.

600



601

00:12:48.50,00:12:50.09

602

No, no, I'm fine.

603



604

00:12:50.30,00:12:53.61

605

And you know why?[br]Because of all the riboflavin.

606



607

00:12:58.82,00:13:00.73

608

Didn't you have that on last night?

609



610

00:13:01.54,00:13:03.45

611

I stayed at Kate's[br]but nothing happened.

612



613

00:13:04.58,00:13:06.01

614

Hey, where were you?

615



616

00:13:06.26,00:13:09.88

617

I'm so, so sorry.[br]I am definitely gonna see your play.

618



619

00:13:10.10,00:13:13.33

620

I swear, your play is very important[br]to us. Thank you for your patience.

621



622

00:13:13.58,00:13:16.37

623

Your play is the next play[br]I'm gonna see.

624



625

00:13:18.18,00:13:19.49

626

How'd it go with Kate?

627



628

00:13:19.70,00:13:20.49

629

It was great!

630



631

00:13:20.70,00:13:25.21

632

I walked her home, and it was[br]amazing how much we connected.

633



634

00:13:25.46,00:13:26.81

635

Then she passed out.

636



637

00:13:27.06,00:13:28.73

638

But then she woke up.

639



640

00:13:28.98,00:13:31.28

641

And we stayed up all night talking.

642



643

00:13:31.50,00:13:33.57

644

And now we're crazy about each other!

645



646

00:13:35.18,00:13:36.53

647

You had "the night" !

648



649

00:13:37.58,00:13:40.49

650

When two people realize[br]their feelings for each other. . .

651



652

00:13:40.70,00:13:44.09

653

. . .and they talk for hours and learn[br]all about the other person.

654



655

00:13:44.30,00:13:45.28

656

You think?

657



658

00:13:45.54,00:13:48.29

659

-Did you learn about her family?[br]-Two brothers. One died!

660



661

00:13:48.54,00:13:49.37

662

Yes!

663



664

00:13:56.38,00:13:58.29

665

This is from the woman at the bar.

666



667

00:14:02.86,00:14:05.49

668

Sorry. She thought[br]you were somebody else.

669



670

00:14:08.98,00:14:10.33

671

-What time is it?[br]-One.

672



673

00:14:10.58,00:14:11.97

674

7: 1 5.

675



676

00:14:12.98,00:14:14.33

677

Watch doesn't work.

678



679

00:14:15.58,00:14:18.69

680

Tommy's supposed to be here soon.[br]We're going to lunch.

681



682

00:14:21.06,00:14:24.76

683

Look, I wasn't gonna[br]say anything to you, but. . . .

684



685

00:14:24.98,00:14:28.49

686

All right, I don't think[br]you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

687



688

00:14:29.54,00:14:30.76

689

You don't?

690



691

00:14:30.98,00:14:35.13

692

The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.[br]I think you should stay away from him.

693



694

00:14:36.26,00:14:39.49

695

Or maybe I should stay away[br]from all men.

696



697

00:14:39.90,00:14:42.09

698

It's not just because I'm jealous.

699



700

00:14:43.70,00:14:46.05

701

I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

702



703

00:14:46.66,00:14:50.97

704

Look, the guy actually screamed[br]at this couple sitting in our seats.

705



706

00:14:51.22,00:14:53.49

707

Yeah, and at the end of the play. . .

708



709

00:14:53.90,00:14:58.49

710

. . .he got up, and he just started,[br]like, banging his hands together.

711



712

00:15:00.86,00:15:03.29

713

You don't want to believe me,[br]that's fine.

714



715

00:15:03.54,00:15:04.65

716

We're kidding.

717



718

00:15:07.38,00:15:10.33

719

No one believe me.[br]I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

720



721

00:15:10.66,00:15:13.45

722

-Sorry, Tommy.[br]-What's in the cup?

723



724

00:15:15.02,00:15:17.09

725

What is in the cup?

726



727

00:15:17.30,00:15:18.36

728

Okay, it's coffee.

729



730

00:15:18.58,00:15:20.77

731

Iced coffee?[br]Tell me it's iced coffee.

732



733

00:15:22.38,00:15:24.81

734

-It's hot--[br]-Hot coffee!

735



736

00:15:25.38,00:15:28.73

737

You idiot! You gonna spill[br]hot coffee all over me, huh?

738



739

00:15:28.98,00:15:33.25

740

What are you? Just a big, stupid[br]doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

741



742

00:15:37.58,00:15:39.88

743

What's your favorite thing[br]about summertime?

744



745

00:15:40.14,00:15:43.97

746

Going to the beach[br]when it stays light real late.

747



748

00:15:48.74,00:15:50.81

749

What's your favorite thing[br]about summer?

750



751

00:15:51.78,00:15:54.81

752

I don't know. Probably the smell[br]of freshly cut grass.

753



754

00:15:55.18,00:15:56.77

755

That's a good one.

756



757

00:16:01.38,00:16:05.33

758

Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and[br]my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

759



760

00:16:05.90,00:16:08.09

761

We held the curtain for you.[br]Let's go!

762



763

00:16:13.34,00:16:16.21

764

vic! Where have you been, baby?

765



766

00:16:20.38,00:16:21.25

767

Where's Kate?

768



769

00:16:21.50,00:16:22.81

770

She got a job in L.A.

771



772

00:16:25.58,00:16:30.21

773

I've been waiting up all night[br]for you. Where have you been?

774



775

00:16:31.10,00:16:33.37

776

Where have you been, vic?

777



778

00:16:35.30,00:16:39.08

779

Go to the window. I wanna run down[br]to the truck and show you something.

780



781

00:16:41.38,00:16:43.65

782

What do you got down there, vic?

783



784

00:16:43.90,00:16:46.28

785

What do you got under that tarp?

786



787

00:16:49.30,00:16:50.33

788

When is she leaving?

789



790

00:16:50.66,00:16:53.17

791

Tonight. What are you doing?

792



793

00:16:54.74,00:16:55.93

794

I'm coming up!

795



796

00:16:59.14,00:17:01.29

797

Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

798



799

00:17:06.38,00:17:08.94

800

Use ours across the hall[br]because she. . .

801



802

00:17:09.18,00:17:10.49

803

. . .has problems.

804



805

00:17:10.74,00:17:11.69

806

Thanks.

807



808

00:17:14.74,00:17:15.53

809

Sorry, Tommy.

810



811

00:17:15.78,00:17:18.45

812

I almost spilled this[br]hot coffee on you.

813



814

00:17:19.50,00:17:21.09

815

Yeah, but you didn't.

816



817

00:17:21.34,00:17:22.48

818

No, but. . .

819



820

00:17:23.06,00:17:24.20

821

. . .it's hot.

822



823

00:17:27.86,00:17:30.29

824

Would you stop it?[br]It's getting really old.

825



826

00:17:30.54,00:17:32.41

827

I can't believe no one believes me.

828



829

00:17:32.78,00:17:34.17

830

I do. I believe you.

831



832

00:17:34.74,00:17:35.57

833

You do?

834



835

00:17:35.82,00:17:39.01

836

Yeah. But I also believed her[br]when she said I was next.

837



838

00:17:46.74,00:17:48.21

839

Hey there, little fella.

840



841

00:17:48.50,00:17:50.69

842

Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

843



844

00:17:54.90,00:17:55.81

845

Gross!

846



847

00:17:56.50,00:17:57.29

848

Idiot!

849



850

00:17:58.34,00:18:01.13

851

Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

852



853

00:18:01.38,00:18:05.13

854

"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute![br]I'm a little chick who's disgusting! "

855



856

00:18:05.38,00:18:07.76

857

You're so stupid![br]How are you not yet extinct?

858



859

00:18:10.78,00:18:12.45

860

What are you quacking about?

861



862

00:18:12.86,00:18:14.41

863

Dumb Donald Dodo!

864



865

00:18:18.38,00:18:20.65

866

Step away from the duck.

867



868

00:18:23.94,00:18:25.89

869

Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

One thing you gotta know[br]is that I will never forget you.

989

Yeah, I know.

991

00:20:55.30,00:20:58.21

992

Good thing it's one of those[br]801 numbers, right?

993



994

00:20:58.42,00:21:03.13

995

Phoebe, 800 is toll free.[br]801 is Utah.
