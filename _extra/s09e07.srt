1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
And that's why,no matter what Mommy says...

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
...we really were on a break.Yes, we were.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
Yes, we were.Come here, gorgeous.

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
Look at you.You are the cutest little baby ever.

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
You're just a little-bitty baby,you know that? But you've got...

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
You've got big, beautiful eyes.

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
Yes, you do. And a...And a big, round belly.

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
Big baby butt.

9
00:00:30 --> 00:00:31
I like big butts.

10
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
Oh, my God, Emma.You're laughing.

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
Oh, my God. You've neverdone that before, have you?

12
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
You've never done that before.Daddy made you laugh, huh?

13
00:00:51 --> 00:00:54
Well, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.

14
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
What? What?You wanna hear some more?

15
00:01:03 --> 00:01:05
I'm a terrible father.

19
00:01:45 --> 00:01:47
- What do you know about investments?- How come?

20
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
I'm starting to make good money on theshow, and I should do something with it.

21
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
- What do you do with your money now?- It's taped to the back of my toilet tank.

22
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
I didn't say that.It's in a bank guarded by robots.

23
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
- Do you have any ideas?- A guy at work got me excited...

24
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
...about going in on an emu farm.That'd be kind of cool, huh?

25
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
Pitching in on the weekends,helping to plant the emus.

26
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
Joe, emus are birds.You raise them for meat.

27
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
Yeah. Right!

28
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
People eat birds. Bird meat.

29
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
Do they just fly into your mouth?Or you go in a restaurant and say:

30
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
"Excuse me, I'll havea bucket of fried bird."

31
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
Or maybe just a wing. Or a...

32
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
You should consider somethinga little less risky.

33
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
I think real estate isyour best investment.

34
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
The Fed just lowered the rates, and theinterest on your mortgage is deductible.

35
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
That's right. I know some stuff.

36
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Real estate, huh?

37
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
And you know who's sellinga great apartment? Richard!

38
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
And you know whose knowledge ofher ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!

39
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
- My dad told me. They play golf together.- Well, maybe I'll join them sometime.

40
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
I just hope the club doesn'tslip out of my hand...

41
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
...and beat the mustacheoff his face.

42
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
Hi! You have to help me pick a dress.I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.

43
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
Wow, the boyfriend's parents.That's a big step.

44
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
- Really? That hadn't occurred to me.- They'll love you. Just be yourself.

45
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
They live on the Upper East Sideon Park Avenue.

46
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
Yeah, she can't be herself.

47
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
Okay, so, all right, which dress?

48
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
- You can say neither.- Oh, God. Neither.

49
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
I'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.It'll be fine.

50
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
You are in such good hands,and I am so good with meeting parents.

51
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
With the father, you wanna flirt a little,but not in a gross way.

52
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
Just kind of like, "Mr. Pinzer, I cansee where Wallace gets his good looks."

53
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
- You went out with Wallace Pinzer?- He took the SATs for me.

54
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
- I knew you didn't get a 1400!- Yeah, well, duh! I mean...

55
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
So now, what about with Mike's mom?

56
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
Well, with the mother, just constantlytell her how amazing her son is.

57
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
Take it from me. Moms love me.Ross' mom one time actually said...

58
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
...I am like the daughterthat she never had.

59
00:03:55 --> 00:04:00
- She said what?- She's like the daughter she never had.

60
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Listen.

61
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
I just got Phoebe all dressedto meet Mike's parents.

62
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
She's so nervous. It's so sweet.

63
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Guess what. I made Emma laugh today.

64
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
You what? And I missed it...

65
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
...because I was giving a makeoverto that stupid hippie?!

66
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
Yeah, and it was likea real little person laugh too.

67
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
It was like:

68
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
Only not creepy.

69
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
- What did you do to make her laugh?- I...

70
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
Well, I sang. Actually...

71
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
...I rapped...

72
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
..."Baby Got Back."

73
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
You what?

74
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
You sang to our baby daughter...

75
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
...a song about a guywho likes to have sex...

76
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
...with women with giant asses?

77
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
You know what,if you think about it...

78
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
...it actually promotesa healthy body image...

79
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
...because even big butts...

80
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
...or "juicy doubles" are...

81
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
Please don't take her away from me.

82
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
Hi, come on in.I'm Catherine, the listing agent.

83
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
Hi, I'm Joey. This is Chandler.

84
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
So how come Richard's sellingthe place? Went bankrupt?

85
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
Medical malpractice?Choked on his own mustache?

86
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
He's buying a much bigger place.It's got a great view of Central Park...

87
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
That's enough out of you.

88
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Is there anything we should knowabout the place?

89
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
All the appliances are included.There's a lot of light, a new kitchen.

90
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40
I think you guys would bevery happy here.

91
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
No, we're not together.We're definitely not a couple.

92
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
- Okay. Sorry.- That's all right.

93
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
Wow, you seemedpretty insulted by that.

94
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
What, I'm not good enough for you?

95
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
We are not gonna havethis conversation again.

96
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
Look at this place.Why am I so intimidated by this guy?

97
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
Pretentious art.This huge, macho couch.

98
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
When we knowall he does is sit around...

99
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
...crying about losing Monicato a real man.

100
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
- You don't think he's here, do you?- I don't know.

101
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
It's a nice place, but I gotta say,I don't know if I see myself living here.

102
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
Well, let me see.

103
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
Yeah, I can see it.

104
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
Look at these videos.I mean, who does he think he is?

105
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
Cool Hand Luke.

106
00:06:31 --> 00:06:32
- Oh, my God.- What?

107
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
There's a tape herewith Monica's name on it.

108
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
A tape with a girl's name on it.It's probably a sex tape.

109
00:06:40 --> 00:06:41
Wait a minute.

110
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
This says "Monica."

111
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
And this is Richard's apartment.

112
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
Get there faster!

113
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
Wow. You look...

114
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
...like my mom.

115
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
I'm wearing pantyhose.

116
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
- Great! Come on in.- Okay.

117
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
Thank you.

118
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
- Oh, my God. You're rich.- No, my parents are rich.

119
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
Well, so? They gotta die someday.Hello!

120
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.

121
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
Phoebe, these are my parents,Theodore and Bitsy.

122
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
Theodore, Bitsy...

123
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
...what a delight.

124
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
- It's so nice to finally meet you.- And you.

125
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
Your home is lovely.

126
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
Thank you. I'll give you a tour later.It's actually three floors.

127
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
Holy crap!

128
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
Why don't you come meet our friends.

129
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
Try and stop me.

130
00:07:47 --> 00:07:50
- What are you doing?- Trying to get your parents to like me.

131
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
I'm sure they will,but you don't have to do this.

132
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
I want them to get to know Phoebe,not "Phoebe."

133
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
- You've got it.- All right.

134
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
It's hard to stop.

135
00:08:00 --> 00:08:01
Well, come on.

136
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Phoebe, these are our friendsTom and Sue Engel.

137
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
Phoebe, come sit.Tell us a little bit about yourself.

138
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
- So where are you from?- Okay.

139
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
Well, all right.Originally, I'm from upstate...

140
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
...but then my mom killed herself,and my stepdad went to prison.

141
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
So I moved to the city, where I lived ina burned-out Buick LeSabre for a while.

142
00:08:20 --> 00:08:21
Which was okay. That was okay.

143
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
Until I got hepatitis, you know...

144
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
...because this pimp spitin my mouth and...

145
00:08:27 --> 00:08:28
But I got over it.

146
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
And, anyway, now I'ma freelance massage therapist...

147
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
...which isn't always steady money,but at least I don't pay taxes.

148
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
So where does everyone summer?

149
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
- Oh, God, this is not going well.- No, you're doing fine. Really.

150
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
- Why don't you go talk to my dad.- Okay, okay, okay.

151
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
- Still sure about me being myself?- Absolutely.

152
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
Though maybe justa little less "pimp spit."

153
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
So, Theodore, I can seewhere Mike gets his good looks from.

154
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
Well...

155
00:09:09 --> 00:09:13
- You must work out all the time.- Not all the time. I do the best I can.

156
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
Yeah, I bet. Look out!

157
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?- I recently had surgery.

158
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
- I'm so sorry.- No, I'll be fine.

159
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
- I just should check the stitches.- I really am sorry.

160
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
How could you know? Why wouldn'tyou punch me in the stomach?

161
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
Did you just hit my dad?

162
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
Yes. I'm sorry. I've never meta boyfriend's parents before.

163
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
But, I mean, you have methumans before, right?

164
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
Why don't you go talk to my mom.

165
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
Okay, yeah, your mom.She looks nice. I can talk to her.

166
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
You do that, and I'm gonna go checkmy dad for signs of internal bleeding.

167
00:09:46 --> 00:09:50
Bitsy? Listen, I wanted to thank youagain for having me here tonight.

168
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
Well, not at all.

169
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
Also, I just want you to knowwhat a wonderful man your son is.

170
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
- Thank you. I think so too.- It's a testament to how he was raised.

171
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
Especially to you,because he's very respectful of women.

172
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
- Is he really?- He is so considerate of my feelings.

173
00:10:04 --> 00:10:08
You know, I think you'd also liketo know that he is a very gentle lover.

174
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
Excuse me?

175
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
No, don't get me wrong.No, not in like a sissy way.

176
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
When he gets going...

177
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
...he can rattle a headboardlike a sailor on leave.

178
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
That's... my boy.

179
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
Awesome.

180
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
I'm not gonna watch it.I don't need to watch it.

181
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
I mean, what good couldpossibly come from watching it?

182
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.

183
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
- Hey, dude, what's up?- Don't judge me! I'm only human!

184
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
Did you take that tape?

185
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
I had to! Lmagine you were marriedand you found a tape of your wife...

186
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn'tyou need to know what was on it?

187
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
I don't know. Who am I married to?

188
00:10:58 --> 00:10:59
Some girl.

189
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
She hot?

190
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
How did she get me to settle down?

191
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
All right, I'm gonna watch it.

192
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
I mean, it's probablynot even what I think it is.

193
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
Even if it is, it can't possibly be asbad as what I'm picturing in my head.

194
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
Can it?

195
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
See, in my experience,if a girl says yes to being taped...

196
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
...she doesn't say no to much else,I'll tell you.

197
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
- Then you have to watch it for me.- What?

198
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
Just for a few secondsso I can know what it is. Please?

199
00:11:26 --> 00:11:30
All right, fine. But if I enjoy this,you have only yourself to blame!

200
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
- Why am I hearing cheering?- It's okay. It's just a football game.

201
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
- It's just football?- You were all worried for nothing.

202
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
It's football! It's just football!

203
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
This is great! This is the first timeI've ever enjoyed football!

204
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
I think it may be customaryto get a beer!

205
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
What the...?

206
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
- What are you doing?- You don't wanna see what I just saw!

207
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
What are you guys doing?

208
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
Oh, my God! Is that Richard?

209
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
Okay, please laugh for Mommy.Please?

210
00:12:05 --> 00:12:06
Please laugh for Mommy.

211
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
Not funny, huh?

212
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
Well, so is it...

213
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
...only offensive novelty rap?

214
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.Because Mommy can rap.

215
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
I can't rap.

216
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
All right, sweetheart. This isonly because I love you so much.

217
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
And I know that you'renot gonna tell anybody.

218
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
Emma, you're laughing! You are!

219
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
You really do like big butts, don't you?

220
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
You beautiful little weirdo.

221
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
You missed it! She was laughing!

222
00:13:15 --> 00:13:16
It was amazing.

223
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
It was amazing. It was the mostbeautiful, beautiful sound.

224
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
I know, isn't it?What'd you do to get her to laugh?

225
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
You know, I just...A couple of things I tried. Different...

226
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
Just sang a little"The ltsy-Bitsy Spider."

227
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
You sang "Baby Got Back," didn't you?

228
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
Nothing else worked!That girl is all about the ass!

229
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
And then it goes back to the chorus.

230
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
Resolve.And that's the end of the song.

231
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
I realize you hadn't askedto hear it...

232
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
...but no one had spokenin 17 minutes.

233
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
Phoebe writes lots of songs. What wasthat one you sang the other night?

234
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
"Pervert Parade"?

235
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
- "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?- Stop.

236
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
Oh, God. Is that veal?

237
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
Mom, I thought I told you,Phoebe's a vegetarian.

238
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
No, that's okay. That's okay.I mean, I am a vegetarian...

239
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
...except for veal.Yeah. No. Veal I love.

240
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
- Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.- Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.

241
00:14:21 --> 00:14:22
But, you know, especially veal.

242
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
You know, and this nice vein of fatrunning through it.

243
00:14:38 --> 00:14:39
Yummy.

244
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
So...

245
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
...what do you think?

246
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
So you stole that tapefrom Richard's apartment?

247
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
Listen to the judgmentfrom the porn star!

248
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
That tape was never meantto be seen by...

249
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
Joey, I would feel more comfortableif this conversation were in private.

250
00:15:06 --> 00:15:11
Monica, look, I don't think you and Ihave any secrets anymore.

251
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
Not ready to joke about it yet?See you later.

252
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
Why in the world would you takethis tape? And why would you watch it?

253
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
Because that's who I am. Okay?

254
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
I'm sure a man like Richard could seea tape like that and not be bothered.

255
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
It'd just be another saucy anecdote...

256
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
...for him to share at his men's clubover brandy and mustaches.

257
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
Is all of this about you not being ableto grow a mustache?

258
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
This is about you and Richard.He's clearly not over you.

259
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
He keeps a tape so he canlook at it whenever he wants.

260
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
Isn't that sad?Can't you see how pathetic that is?

261
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
Don't be jealous.You should feel bad for him.

262
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
Yeah, well, poor Richard, he...

263
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
I can grow a mustache.

264
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
This is not our problem. We haveeach other. That's all that matters.

265
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
But I just keep picturing you rollingaround with him, with your...

266
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
...cowboy boots in the air.

267
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
Cowboy boots? I've never worncowboy boots in my whole life.

268
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
Good, good. Play morebecause I wanna see how it ends.

269
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
- That's not me!- What?

270
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
That's not you! Life is good again!

271
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
Ride 'em, cowgirl!

272
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
That bastard taped over me!

273
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Is that a problem?

274
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
It's just so insulting.Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!

275
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
I can't imagine what he sees in her.

276
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
She actually makes me missthat pill-popping ex-wife of his.

277
00:16:32 --> 00:16:33
Hello, dear.

278
00:16:34 --> 00:16:37
- What's going on?- We were just chitchatting.

279
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
- How's your friend?- A little better.

280
00:16:39 --> 00:16:43
Do you know who's moving back intotown? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.

281
00:16:43 --> 00:16:47
You remember her, Michael.She's lovely, well-behaved and single.

282
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
- I'm not interested.- Please, darling, let's be honest.

283
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
You can have all the sailor funyou want with that one.

284
00:16:54 --> 00:16:55
- But let's be real.- All right, stop.

285
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
All Phoebe has done is try and get youto like her. Maybe it's not clear...

286
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
...but she did her best.

287
00:17:01 --> 00:17:05
- She's a little different than you are.- Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.

288
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
So what? If I can get past that,it shouldn't bother you.

289
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
You don't have to like her.Just accept the fact that I do.

290
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
If you can't even be civilto the woman I love...

291
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
- The woman you what?- Yeah, the woman you what?

292
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
The woman I love.

293
00:17:24 --> 00:17:25
I love you.

294
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
Something I shouldn't say forthe first time, in front of my parents...

295
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
...and Tom and Sue.

296
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
Who are, by the way, the most sinfullyboring people I've ever met in my life.

297
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
- I love you too.- You do?

298
00:17:42 --> 00:17:43
How great is this?

299
00:17:46 --> 00:17:47
Wanna get out of here?

300
00:17:48 --> 00:17:51
- Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner.- I had a great time.

301
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
It was really top-drawer.And here's something rich.

302
00:17:54 --> 00:17:58
Thirteen bathrooms in this place,I threw up in the coat closet.

303
00:17:58 --> 00:17:59
Ta-ta!

304
00:18:14 --> 00:18:16
One more time from the top!

305
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
Rachel, please!That is so inappropriate!

306
00:18:29 --> 00:18:30
