00:00:01 --> 00:00:01
I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
Mom, would you relax?

4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
That was 10 blocks from here,and she was walking alone at night.

5
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
I would never do that.

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

7
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
This is a safe street. This isa safe building. There's nothing...

8
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Oh, my God! What areyou doing in here?!

9
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
Mom, I gotta go! I gotta go!

10
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
That's fine, you just read the paper.

12
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
I'm gonna get a pot.

13
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
It's not for you.

14
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Okay, that's fine.

15
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
Read the "Family Circus"...

16
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
...enjoy the gentle comedy...

17
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God...

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
It's open, you guys.

19
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
Can I help you?

20
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
Does Phoebe still live here?

21
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
No, she doesn't. But I can geta message to her.

22
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
Great. Just tell herher husband stopped by.

23
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
Her what?

24
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
How did you do that?

27
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
This is unbelievable, Pheebs.How can you be married?

28
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
I'm not "married"married, you know?

29
00:01:54 --> 00:01:55
He's just a friend, and he's gay...

30
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
...and he was from Canada,and he needed a Green Card.

31
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
I can't believe you married Duncan!

32
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
How could you not tell me?We told each other everything.

33
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
I'm sorry, but I knewif I told you, you'd get judgmental...

34
00:02:06 --> 00:02:06
...and wouldn't approve.

35
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
Of course I wouldn't approve!

36
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
You were totally in lovewith this guy who, hello, was gay.

37
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
What the hell were you thinking?

38
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
See? And you thoughtshe'd be judgmental.

39
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
I wasn't in love with him.I was helping out a friend.

40
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
When he left town, youstayed in your pajamas for a month.

41
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

42
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
Well, didn't you?

43
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
I might have.

44
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

45
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
Like you tell me everything?

46
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
What have I not told you?

47
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
I don't know.

48
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
The fact that the underwear outon the telephone pole is yours...

49
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
...from when you had sexwith Bobby on the terrace!

50
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
What?

51
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
Wait a minute! Who told you?

52
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
You are dead meat.

53
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
I didn't know it was a big secret.

54
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

55
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Kind of the same as, say...

56
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
...I don't know, havinga third nipple!

57
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
You have a third nipple?

58
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
You bitch!

59
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
Whip it out! Whip it out!

60
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
There's nothing to see! It's atiny bump. It's totally useless.

61
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
As opposed to your othermulti-functional nipples?

62
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
I can't believe you!You told me it was a nubbin.

63
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
Joey, what did you thinka nubbin was?

64
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
You see something, you hear a word,I thought that's what it was.

65
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
- Let me see it again!- Yes, show us your nubbin!

66
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
Joey was in a porno movie!

67
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
If I'm going down,I'm taking everybody with me!

68
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
- Oh, my God!- You were in a porno?!

69
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
I was young and I just wanted a job.

70
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
But I couldn't go through with it.

71
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
They let me be the guy who fixesthe copier but can't...

72
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
...because there's peoplehaving sex on it.

73
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
That is wild!

74
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
- What's it shaped like?- Is it hairy?

75
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
What happens if you flick it?

76
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
So does it do anything,you know, special?

77
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
Pressing my third nippleopens the delivery entrance...

78
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
...to the magical land of Narnia.

79
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
In some cultures, having a third nippleis actually a sign of virility.

80
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
You get the best huts,and women dance naked around you.

81
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
Are any of these cultures,per chance, in the Tri-State area?

82
00:04:18 --> 00:04:23
You know, you are so amazing.Is there anything you don't know?

83
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
Julie's so smart!Julie's so special!

84
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
I wanted you to hook upwith Ross as much as you did.

85
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
But he's with her now.You'll have to get over it.

86
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

87
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
I didn't know that's what I had to do.I just have to get over it.

88
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
- Sassy lady!- Where are you going?

89
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
I'm meeting Duncan.He's skating tonight at the Garden.

90
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
He's in the Capades.

91
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
- The Ice Capades?- No, the Gravel Capades.

92
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
The turns aren't as fast,but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

93
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
I can't believeyou'd dress up for him.

94
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
You're setting yourself upall over again.

95
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
Okay, no.

96
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
For your information, I'm seeing himso I can put those feelings behind me.

97
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
The reason I'm dressed like thisis because I think it's nice...

98
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
...to look nice for your gay husband.

99
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

100
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
Chandler, will you fill me up here?

101
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
I see, I see. Because ofthe third-nipple thing.

102
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.

103
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
- See you later, Rach.- Bye-bye, Julie.

104
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
Come on, cut it out!

105
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
- Can I ask you something?- Sure.

106
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
What?

107
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
Come on, talk to me.

108
00:05:57 --> 00:06:02
What's the longest you've beenin a relationship before...

109
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
...having the sex?

110
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
Why? Who's not...?Are you and Julie not...?

111
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
Are you and Julie not having sex?

112
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Technically?

113
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
No.

114
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

115
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
Or because she's kind of bossy,makes it feel like school?

116
00:06:23 --> 00:06:27
No! She's great. And it's notlike we haven't done anything.

117
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
We do plenty of other stuff.Lots of other stuff like...

118
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
No! Don't need to know the details.

119
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
No, it's just...

120
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
It's me.

121
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
I've only been withone woman my whole life...

122
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

123
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
So now I've got myselfall psyched out.

124
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
It's become, like, this...

125
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
...this thing!

126
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
You must just think I'm weird.

127
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
No, I don't think it's weird.

128
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
I think, in fact...

129
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
- In fact, you know what I think?- What?

130
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
I think it's sexy.

131
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
Sexy?

132
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
Let me tell you something.As a woman...

133
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
...there is nothing sexier...

134
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
...than a man who does notwant to have sex.

135
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
No kidding?

136
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
You know what I'd do?

137
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
I'd wait.

138
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
- You'd wait?- Absolutely. I would wait...

139
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
...and wait...

140
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
Then I'd wait some more.

141
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Really?

142
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
I don't care if she tells youshe wants it, she begs, she pleads...

143
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
...she tells you she's gonnahave sex with another man...

144
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
That just means it's working.

145
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Women really want this?

146
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
More than jewelry.

147
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
Look at you! You look great!

148
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
Do I? Thank you.

149
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
So do you. Sparkly!

150
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
This is pretty wonderful,Mr. Major Capades Guy!

151
00:08:13 --> 00:08:18
I remember when you were justKing Friday in Mr. Roger's "Ice Is Nice".

152
00:08:18 --> 00:08:19
You always said I'd make it.

153
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
Well, you know,I'm kind of spooky that way.

154
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
Gosh, I missed you!

155
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
- I'm gonna get changed.- Okay.

156
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
Now.

157
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
Oh! Right. Okay.

158
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
Olé!

159
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
What?

160
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
The Matador...

161
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
Olé!

162
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
Sweetie, can youhold this for a second?

163
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
Sorry, you had apaleontologist on your face.

164
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
But it's gone now.You're all right.

165
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
Hi, everyone.

166
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
I wanted to thank youfor our little talk before.

167
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
No problem! So you're gonnago with the waiting thing?

168
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
I was going to, but afterI talked to you, I talked to Joey.

169
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
Good. What did he say?

170
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
He told me to get over myselfand just do it.

171
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
I thought about what you saidand about what he said.

172
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
And his way, I getto have sex tonight, so...

173
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
What is this in my pocket?

174
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
Why, it's Joey's porno movie!

175
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
Pop it in!

176
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
I'm fine, if you'reokay watching a video...

177
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
...filled with two-nippled people.

178
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
People having sex.That's just what I need to see.

179
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
What's wrong with people having sex?

180
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
Well, you know, thesemovies are offensive...

181
00:10:00 --> 00:10:05
...and degradingto women and females...

182
00:10:05 --> 00:10:09
And the lighting'salways unflattering.

183
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
- Monica, help me out here.- Hell, I wanna see Joey!

184
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
So is there a story?Or do they just start doing it right...

185
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
Oh. Never mind.

186
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
Wait a minute. That is the craziesttyping test I've ever seen.

187
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
All I say is, she'dbetter get the job.

188
00:10:29 --> 00:10:33
Looks to me like he'sthe one getting the job.

189
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
Here I come.

190
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

191
00:10:36 --> 00:10:41
I can't get to the copier.I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

192
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
So I just watch them have sex.

193
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
Then I say... Here's my line!

194
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
for the paper tray.

195
00:10:51 --> 00:10:52
Nice work, my friend!

196
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56
Wait, you see me again. Hang on,the guy's butt's blocking me.

197
00:10:56 --> 00:11:01
There I am. There I am.There I am...

198
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
So what's up?You came to see me yesterday.

199
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
I kind of need a divorce.

200
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
O...

201
00:11:16 --> 00:11:17
...kay.

202
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
How come?

203
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
Actually, I'm getting married again.

204
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
What?

205
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
I don't know how to tell you this.

206
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
I'm straight.

207
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
I don't understand.How can you be straight?

208
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
You're so smart and funny...

209
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
...and you throwsuch great Academy Award parties!

210
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
That's what I kept telling myself.

211
00:11:40 --> 00:11:44
But you reach a pointwhere you can't live a lie anymore.

212
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
How long have you known?

213
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
I guess on some levelI always knew I was straight.

214
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
I thought I was supposedto be something else.

215
00:11:52 --> 00:11:57
I'm an ice dancer, all my friendsare gay. I was just trying to fit in.

216
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
And there's actually a woman?

217
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
Her name's Debra.

218
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
Well, is she the firstthat you've been with?

219
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
I've never told you this...

220
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
...but there were oneor two times back in college when...

221
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
...I'd get drunk,go to a straight bar...

222
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
...and wake up witha woman next to me.

223
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
I told myself it was the liquor,and everyone experiments in college.

224
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
Sure.

225
00:12:25 --> 00:12:30
Now I know I don't have a choice.I was born this way!

226
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
I don't know what to say.

227
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
You're married to someone forsix years and you think you know him.

228
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
And then one day he says,"Oh, I'm not gay!"

229
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
I'm still me.

230
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
Why couldn't you just havefigured this out six years ago?

231
00:12:51 --> 00:12:55
You know, it stillsmells like monkey in there.

232
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
That saves us the conversation.

233
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
This has been great,but I'm officially wiped.

234
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Me too. We should get going.

235
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
No! Come on, you guys!

236
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
Come on, it's only 11:30.

237
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
Let's just talk. We never justhang out and talk anymore.

238
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
Rachel, that's all we do.

239
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
Maybe that's all we do.What about Julie?

240
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
What about Julie?

241
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
You have been in our livesfor nearly two months now...

242
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
...and we don't really know you.

243
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
I mean, who is Julie?

244
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
What do you like?What don't you like?

245
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
We want to know everything.

246
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
Well, that could take awhile.

247
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
So?

248
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
Who here does not havethe time to get to know Julie?

249
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
I got the time to get to know Julie.

250
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
I know her pretty well.Can I go?

251
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
That's fine.

252
00:13:47 --> 00:13:51
Let's start with your childhood.What was that like?

253
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
In a nutshell...

254
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
So, have you told your parents?

255
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
No, but it'll be okay.They're pretty cool.

256
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
My brother's straight, so...

257
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
Here you go.

258
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
You know what?I just have one more question.

259
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
If you had figured this out sooner,and I had been around...

260
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
...do you think Iwould have been the one...?

261
00:14:15 --> 00:14:16
No. Don't tell me.

262
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
I don't think either answerwould make me feel better. Here.

263
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
I love you, Phoebe.

264
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
So your brother's straight, huh?

265
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
Seriously.

266
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
- And my second-grade teacherwas Miss Thomas...

267
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
...and my first-grade teacherwas Mrs. Cobb.

268
00:14:47 --> 00:14:48
Mrs. Gobb?

269
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

270
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
What exactly is in a cobb salad?

271
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
I'm going home.

272
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

273
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
Good night.

274
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
It's pretty late. You'reprobably not still planning on...

275
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
No, I am.

276
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
Are you nervous?

277
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
I have done it before.

278
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
I mean, how areyou gonna handle it?

279
00:15:21 --> 00:15:26
Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?Are you just gonna pounce?

280
00:15:26 --> 00:15:28
I don't know. I guessI'm just gonna...

281
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
...see what happens.

282
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
Good luck!

283
00:15:34 --> 00:15:35
What?

284
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
Nothing...

285
00:15:38 --> 00:15:42
It is your first time with her,and if the first time doesn't go well...

286
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
...well then, that's pretty darnhard to recover from.

287
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
Okay, now I'm nervous.

288
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
Maybe you should put it off.

289
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
No, I don't want to put it off!

290
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
I spent last year beingso unbelievably miserable.

291
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
And now I'm actually happy.

292
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
You know, I mean really happy.

293
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
I just don't wanna...

294
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

295
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
I know.

296
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
It's not your fault.

298
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Right.

299
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
Maybe it doesn'thave to be this tough.

300
00:16:24 --> 00:16:28
Maybe you were on the right trackwith that whole "spontaneous" thing.

301
00:16:28 --> 00:16:32
- Women really like that.- Really?

302
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
I mean if it were me,I'd want you to...

303
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
I don't know, catch me off guardwith a really...

304
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
...good kiss.

305
00:16:43 --> 00:16:47
Really sort of soft at first.

306
00:16:47 --> 00:16:51
And then maybe brushthe hair away from my face.

307
00:16:51 --> 00:16:55
And then look far into my eyes...

308
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
...in a way that lets meknow something...

309
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
...amazing is about to happen.

310
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
And then, I don't know, then...

311
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
...you'd pull mereally close to you so that...

312
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
...so that I'd be pressed upright against you.

313
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
And it would get kind of...

314
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
...sweaty...

315
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
...and blurry.

316
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
And then it's just happening.

317
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
Thanks, Rach. Good night!

318
00:17:36 --> 00:17:39
Oh, God!

319
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
Good morning!

320
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
Well, somebody got some last night!

321
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
Twice!
