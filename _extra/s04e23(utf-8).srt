1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:03
Hurry up!The flight leaves in four hours!

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
There could be traffic!The plane could leave early!

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
In London, there could bea line at customs! Come on!

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:14
Six-hour trip to London.That's a lot of Monica.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
Passport, check. Camera, check.Traveler's checks, check.

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
- Who are you saying "check" to?- Myself.

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:21
For remembering to pack a thing.

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
You do a good thing,you get a "check".

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
Mom does it.I never realized it was weird.

10
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
My mom used to put her headin the oven.

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
Actually, only the one time.But it's pretty weird.

12
00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
Are you ready yet?

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
- Got the tickets?- Right here. Check!

14
00:00:41 --> 00:00:42
It's all London, baby!

15
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
Here we go.

16
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
Got your passport?

17
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
Third drawer of my dresser.You don't want to lose that!

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
There it is!

19
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
The One With Ross' Wedding

20
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
The vacuum's in my closeton the left side.

21
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
Garbage bags are nextto the refrigerator.

22
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
Rachel's gonna be here.Can't I just ask her?

23
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
Yeah, okay. Give that a try!

24
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
- Let's do it.- Cheerio!

25
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
London, baby!

26
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
That's not gonna get annoying.

27
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
London, baby!

28
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
You know what?I was wrong.

29
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
We're all here.Let's get going!

30
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
I want to go over and hug you...

31
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
...and wish you luck,but I can't get up.

32
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
- I'll come hug you.- Great, can you bring me the paper?

33
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
- Have a great wedding.- Thanks.

34
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
Chandler, I want to hug you too!

35
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
You might as well bring my bookfrom your apartment.

36
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
- So we're off.- Have fun!

37
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
- I can't believe you won't be there.- I know.

38
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
Come. Why don't you come?

39
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
To London. Please?It would mean so much to me.

40
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
I gotta work. I'm sorry.

41
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
Why can't you takea couple of days off?

42
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
Because I can't.I told you.

43
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
This is my wedding.

44
00:02:32 --> 00:02:36
Now we are late.Let's go, let's go!

45
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
Fine, you'll watch iton video when we get back.

46
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
Here you go, Phoebe!Phoe-bo! Phoo-ba-la!

47
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
You!

48
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
Let's go!

49
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
Bye, Pheebs!

50
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
London, baby!

51
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
Oh, God!

52
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Do you need a hug?

53
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
You don't have to bring me anything.

54
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
Chandler, do something!

55
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
- Do something!- I am. I'm ignoring you.

56
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
I'll be the on-camera guy.

57
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
All right. First stop...

58
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
...Westminster Abbey.

59
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
What is that?

60
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
That's London, baby!

61
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
All right, the hotel's here.

62
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
Wait.

63
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
We want to go...

64
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
I know.

65
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
I'm gonna have to go into the map.

66
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
If you see a little versionof me in there, kill it!

67
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
I got it.

68
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
Here we go!

69
00:03:53 --> 00:03:58
We're not gonna have to walk this waythe entire time, are we?

70
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
Man, you made me lose it!

71
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
That was all before 10:00.

72
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
The caterer rang. It'll be ChickenKiev, not Tarragon.

73
00:04:09 --> 00:04:10
Then the florist saidthere are no tulips.

74
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
And the cellist hascarpal tunnel syndrome...

75
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
Emily, honey. Okay?

76
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
Well, up yours too!

77
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
- No! That's "time out".- Sorry.

78
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
Sweetie, relax.Everything will be great, okay?

79
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
Come on, come on.

80
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Chicken Kiev?

81
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
Doesn't that sound deliciousat the last minute?

82
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
Salmon would bemore elegant than chicken.

83
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
And you wouldn't worryabout the salmonella.

84
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
I can't wait to seewhere you're getting married.

85
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
It's beautiful.Her parents got married here.

86
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
I can't believethey're tearing it down.

87
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
It's really the most lovely building.It's over...

88
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
Oh, my God!

89
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
It's nice.

90
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
Oh, my God!

91
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
What are we going to do?

92
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Everything's gonna be all right.

93
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
How's it gonna be all right?

94
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
I see that.

95
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
I talked to a guy,and I found out what happened.

96
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
They tore it down early.

97
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
All right!

98
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
Westminster Abbey.

99
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

100
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
What do you think of the Abbey?

101
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
It's great! They're thinkingof changing the name.

102
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
- To what?- To "Put the Camera Away"!

103
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

104
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
- Don't get up. What do you need?- Nothing.

105
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
Come on. I'm hereto take care of you.

106
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
Okay, I have a wedgie.

107
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
That is all you.

108
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
What do you want for lunch?

109
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
I don't know.

110
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
I guess we have to eat.

111
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Yeah, I do.

112
00:06:04 --> 00:06:05
What's the matter?

113
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
I'm bummed the wayI left things with Ross.

114
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
I wish I didn't lie about work.He seemed so mad at me.

115
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
Don't be so hard on yourself.If I was still in love with some...

116
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
Still in love with?

117
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
I'm not in love with Ross.

118
00:06:21 --> 00:06:22
Good!

119
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
Yeah, me neither.

120
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
I'm not at the wedding,because he's my ex-boyfriend...

121
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
...and that would be uncomfortable.

122
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
Not because I'm in love with him.I like Ross as much as anyone.

123
00:06:33 --> 00:06:36
Clearly, I have feelings for him,but they don't mean love.

124
00:06:36 --> 00:06:41
I mean, do I still haveloving feelings for Ross? Yeah!

125
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
I have continuing feelings of love.

126
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
But that doesn't meanI'm still in love with him.

127
00:06:45 --> 00:06:50
I have sexual feelings for him,but I do love him.

128
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Oh, my God!

129
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
Why didn't you tell me?

130
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
- We thought you knew!- We?

131
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
We all know.We talk about it all the time.

132
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
You all know?Does Ross know?

133
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
No! Ross doesn't know anything.

134
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
And you didn't tell me!

135
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
We thought you knew.It's so obvious!

136
00:07:10 --> 00:07:11
It would be like telling Monica:

137
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
"Hey, you like things clean. "

138
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
What are you in the market for?Scarves, souvenir post cards...

139
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
Check this out!

140
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
That's the stuff!What do you think?

141
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
I won't need that"I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.

142
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
Well, I like it. Here you go.

143
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
You're not really buying that.Haven't you embarrassed me enough?

144
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
Oh, I embarrass you?

145
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
How can I answer whenI'm pretending I don't know you?

146
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
He's just jealous.All Londoners wear them.

147
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
Really? Then how come no one hereanywhere is wearing one?

148
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
They're all tourists.

149
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
If you insist on wearing thatin public...

150
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
...you're gonna spend the afternoonall by yourself.

151
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
If you make me choose betweenyou and the hat, I choose the hat.

152
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
- Good choice.- Thanks.

153
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
That's it! I'm out of here.I won't be embarrassed anymore.

154
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
I spoke to your dad,and you know what?

155
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
He thinks we can find a new hall.

156
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
- We don't have to.- You found a place?

157
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
No, but Monica and I were talking...

158
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
...and I was so upset about the hallbeing knocked down...

159
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
...she suggested we putthe wedding off for a bit.

160
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
She said what?

161
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
If I won't be happy with somewherewe'd find in a day...

162
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
...we should postpone it.

163
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
Postpone it.

164
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
Do you think Monica realizeshow much our parents spent on this?

165
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
Do you think my sister's teeny,tiny, little brain comprehends...

166
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
...that people took timeout of their lives...

167
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
...to fly thousands of milesto be here?

168
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
This isn't right.

169
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
I realize thatpeople are gonna be disappointed.

170
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
But I'm sure they'll come back.

171
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
I can't ask people to do that.Would you?

172
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
Don't you point your pants at me!

173
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
We have no choice.

174
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
Anywhere half-decentwill have been booked.

175
00:09:15 --> 00:09:16
Don't you understand?This is our wedding!

176
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
Postponing it is not an option.This is when we're getting married.

177
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
- You're saying it's now or never?- I'm saying it's now.

178
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
- Or?- There's no "or" in mine!

179
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
What is wrong with these pants?

180
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
It's not the pants.It's you who's backwards.

181
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
If you don't understandhow important this is to me...

182
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
...perhaps we shouldn't marry at all!

183
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
Emily, no! Wait, stop!Emily, please...

184
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
Did shopping help youfeel any better?

185
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
Manhattan doesn't have enough stores.

186
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
I can help you get over him.

187
00:09:54 --> 00:09:54
You can?

188
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
I need you to bring mephotos of Ross...

189
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
...and a small piece of chocolate...

190
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
...and a glass of tepid water.

191
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
Is this where you throw stuff...

192
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
...in a bag with graveyard dirtand hang it from a north-facing tree?

193
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
Only if you have the hiccups too.

194
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
The chocolate and water are for me.I didn't feel like getting up.

195
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
I'll show you a picture of Ross.

196
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
And you remember allthe bad things about him.

197
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
- Focus on his flaws.- I can do that.

198
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
I did thatwhile we were going out.

199
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
Before we start, I want to say,for the record, I love Ross.

200
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
He's such a great guy.

201
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
Close your eyes.

202
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
Imagine that you're with Ross.

203
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
Imagine that you're kissing him.

204
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
You're running your handsall over his body.

205
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
You run your handsthrough his hair but...

206
00:10:45 --> 00:10:49
Gross!It's some kind of grease.

207
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
I don't know.

208
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
His hair never bothered me that much.

209
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
It was more crunchythan it was greasy.

210
00:11:00 --> 00:11:01
This will be harder than I thought.

211
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
Let's try some aversion therapy.

212
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
Look at the picture.

213
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
How do you feel now?

214
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
Well, I like you less.

215
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
Sorry.

216
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have saidyou were embarrassing me.

217
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
That wasn't cool.

218
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
If it makes you feel any better,I've had a really lousy day.

219
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
Me too.

220
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
- Yeah?- No!

221
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
I had the best day ever!

222
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
Dude, check this out!

223
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
Tell my friend you like my hat.

224
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
- What's your friend's name?- Chandler.

225
00:11:59 --> 00:12:00
Hi, Chandler.

226
00:12:00 --> 00:12:01
That's...

227
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
That's Fergie, baby!

228
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
Joey says you don't like his hat,but I think it's kind of dashing.

229
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
When did you...?How?

230
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
I was trying to getto Buckingham Palace.

231
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
So I'm in my map and...

232
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
I understand you hada talk with Emily.

233
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
Yes, I did.

234
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
And you are welcome.

235
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
Am I?

236
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
Was it your ideato postpone the wedding?

237
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
- I'm going to the bathroom.- Wait up!

238
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Since you're the fix-it lady,here's a pickle:

239
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
What do you do when the bride saysshe doesn't want the wedding at all?

240
00:12:41 --> 00:12:42
She said that?

241
00:12:43 --> 00:12:43
Why?

242
00:12:43 --> 00:12:47
I don't know. I said it was stupidto put off the wedding...

243
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
...and she, like, flipped out.

244
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
Oh, my God!You're even dumber than I am.

245
00:12:53 --> 00:12:54
Excuse me?

246
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
How long have you been planningthis wedding?

247
00:12:57 --> 00:12:58
I don't know. A month?

248
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
Emily's probably been planning itsince she was 5.

249
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
Ever since the first time she hunga pillowcase from her head.

250
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
That's what we did.

251
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.

252
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
In the perfect place.

253
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
With the perfectfour-tiered wedding cake.

254
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
With the little people on top.

255
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
But the most important part...

256
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
...is that we had the perfect guy...

257
00:13:29 --> 00:13:33
...who understood just how importantall that stuff was.

258
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
I had no idea.

259
00:13:36 --> 00:13:41
That pillowcase thing, I thoughtyou were doing "The Flying Nun".

260
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
Sometimes we were.

261
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
Come on.

262
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
Help me figure out what to do.

263
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
Pretty intense, huh?

264
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
I hope Ross didn't think we leftbecause we were uncomfortable here.

265
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
I hope he did.

266
00:14:12 --> 00:14:13
Pheebs, it's Joey.

267
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
Hey, Joey!

268
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
I saw someone that looks justlike you on the subway.

269
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
I was going to say hi, then I figuredhe doesn't care he looks like you.

270
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
That just cost me 4 bucks.

271
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
I called to see how the chickand the duck are doing.

272
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
They're having fun with Aunt Phoebe.Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful.

273
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
So do you miss me?

274
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
Kind of, but I've beenhaving too much fun.

275
00:14:36 --> 00:14:37
You're not homesick yet?

276
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
I don't think so.

277
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
Well, the seven of us miss you.

278
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
- Who's seven?- Me, Rachel...

279
00:14:47 --> 00:14:48
...the birds, the babies.

280
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
The babies miss me?

281
00:14:52 --> 00:14:52
Pizza guy's here!

282
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
You ordered pizza without me?

283
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
But we were thinking about you.We ordered the Joey Special.

284
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
Two pizzas?

285
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
- Gotta go! Talk to you later.- Wait!

286
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
Where did you get it from?

287
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
And they're always glad you came

288
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
You want to be where you can see

289
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
Your troubles are all the same

290
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
You want to beWhere everybody knows your name

291
00:15:29 --> 00:15:30
Why have you brought me here?

292
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
You'll see.

293
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
This wedding won't happen.

294
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
Ross.

295
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
But imagine a lot more lights...

296
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
...and fewer bricks...

297
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
...and flowers and candles.

298
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
And the musicians can go over here.

299
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
The chairs can face this way and...

300
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
You go.

301
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
But if you don't love this,we'll do it any other place or time.

302
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
Really, it's fine.

303
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
Whatever you want.

304
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
It's perfect.

305
00:16:00 --> 00:16:01
And, I don't know, if it rains...

306
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
Then we'll get wet.

307
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
I don't even have a date.

308
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
Do you rememberwhere the duck food is?

309
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
In the guys' apartment,under the sink. Why?

310
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
Because I'm going to London.

311
00:16:19 --> 00:16:20
What? What do you mean?

312
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
I have to tell Ross I love him.

313
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
Take care and don't havethe babies till I get back.

314
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
You can't go.Ross loves Emily.

315
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
I know, but I haveto tell him how I feel.

316
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
He deserves all the informationto make an informed decision.

317
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
You're goingbecause you hope he'll say:

318
00:16:36 --> 00:16:40
"I love you too.Forget the British chippy. "

319
00:16:41 --> 00:16:41
You think he will?

320
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
No, because he's in lovewith the British chippy!

321
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
You're just gonna mess with his headand ruin his wedding.

322
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
It's too late!You missed your chance.

323
00:16:52 --> 00:16:55
I'm sorry.This must be hard.

324
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
But it's over.

325
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
No, it's not overuntil someone says, "I do. "

326
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
I do! I do!

327
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
Like I can really chase you.I'm carrying a litter!

328
00:17:18 --> 00:17:19
The Waltham residence.

329
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
Is this Emily's parents' house?

330
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
This is the housekeeper.

331
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
And, by the way, that is not how oneaddresses a person on the telephone.

332
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
First one identifies oneself...

333
00:17:29 --> 00:17:33
...and then asks for the personwith whom one wishes to speak.

334
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
This is Phoebe Buffay.I was wondering, please...

335
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
...if it's nottoo much trouble, please.

336
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
Might I speak withMiss Emily Waltham, please?

337
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
Miss Waltham isat the rehearsal dinner.

338
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
And it is not politeto make fun of people. Goodbye.

339
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
I'll be nice, I swear.Could you just give me their number?

340
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
I'm afraid I'm not at libertyto divulge that information.

341
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
Somebody is on their way to ruinthe wedding, and I have to warn them.

342
00:17:57 --> 00:17:59
So give me that numberor I'll come over there...

343
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
...and I'll kick your snooty assall the way to New Gloukenshire!

344
00:18:06 --> 00:18:08
She knew I could kick her ass.

345
00:18:13 --> 00:18:14
Hi, sweetheart.

346
00:18:14 --> 00:18:15
Mom, Dad.

347
00:18:16 --> 00:18:17
Sorry, we're late.

348
00:18:17 --> 00:18:18
My fault.I insisted on riding the tube.

349
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
Judy, the kids!

350
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
That's what they call the subway.

351
00:18:24 --> 00:18:25
I thought...

352
00:18:25 --> 00:18:27
Dad, we got it.

353
00:18:27 --> 00:18:29
Here comes my dad and stepmom.

354
00:18:29 --> 00:18:30
Mr. And Mrs. Geller.

355
00:18:30 --> 00:18:32
This is Steven...

356
00:18:32 --> 00:18:33
...and Andrea Waltham.

357
00:18:33 --> 00:18:35
Very nice to meet you.

358
00:18:35 --> 00:18:36
Darling, the Gellers.

359
00:18:37 --> 00:18:38
Darling, it's the Gellers.

360
00:18:38 --> 00:18:42
She's self-involved.I should never have married her.

361
00:18:43 --> 00:18:44
- It's the Gellers.- Where?

362
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
That's one and that's another one.

363
00:18:47 --> 00:18:48
Lovely to meet you.

364
00:18:48 --> 00:18:50
Nice of you to payfor half the wedding.

365
00:18:50 --> 00:18:52
The hell with tradition!We're happy to do it.

366
00:18:52 --> 00:18:54
We know how expensiveweddings can be.

367
00:18:55 --> 00:18:58
Besides, this may bethe only wedding we get to throw.

368
00:18:58 --> 00:19:01
A joke that's funny in all countries.

369
00:19:04 --> 00:19:08
- What's in it?- Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.

370
00:19:10 --> 00:19:13
That's not food.

371
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
Everything's different here.I want to go home.

372
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
I miss my family, the coffeehouse.

373
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
I can't rememberwhat Phoebe looks like!

374
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
It's been three days.

375
00:19:26 --> 00:19:27
You're just homesick.

376
00:19:27 --> 00:19:30
Would you just try to relaxand just enjoy yourself?

377
00:19:30 --> 00:19:33
You're different here too.

378
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
You're mean in England!

379
00:19:36 --> 00:19:37
What the hell?

380
00:19:37 --> 00:19:38
What's up, Dad?

381
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
This bill for my half.It's insane.

382
00:19:40 --> 00:19:42
Why is it so much?The reception's at their house.

383
00:19:43 --> 00:19:46
Flowers, liquor.Re-carpet first floor?

384
00:19:46 --> 00:19:48
New guest bath, landscaping.

385
00:19:48 --> 00:19:50
I'm paying to remodel this house.

386
00:19:50 --> 00:19:53
I'll give that son of a bitcha piece of my mind.

387
00:19:53 --> 00:19:54
Please.

388
00:19:54 --> 00:19:56
I don't want anythingto upset Emily.

389
00:19:56 --> 00:19:58
She's had a hard enoughcouple of days as it is.

390
00:19:59 --> 00:20:00
Here.Let me go talk to him.

391
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
You tell him no one takes advantageof the Gellers.

392
00:20:06 --> 00:20:10
Sometimes I forgethow powerful you can be.

393
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
And I'll go get drunk.

394
00:20:21 --> 00:20:22
Your next flight to London?

395
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
There's one leaving in 30 minutes.

396
00:20:24 --> 00:20:26
And I do have one seat left.

397
00:20:27 --> 00:20:28
Thank you, thank you.

398
00:20:28 --> 00:20:32
The last-minute fareon this ticket is $2700.

399
00:20:32 --> 00:20:34
I don't have enough lefton my credit card.

400
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
You can split it with another card.

401
00:20:36 --> 00:20:39
How about five?

402
00:20:39 --> 00:20:40
Thank you.

403
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
I need to see your passport.

404
00:20:45 --> 00:20:50
I don't have it, but I can tell youwhere it is on my nightstand.

405
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
You know what?I have my driver's license.

406
00:20:54 --> 00:20:57
And I have a 20.

407
00:20:59 --> 00:21:02
My father is not going to payfor the built-in barbecue.

408
00:21:02 --> 00:21:06
And believe me, you cankiss your gazebo goodbye.

409
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
I might be ableto get you the new lawn.

410
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
Then you have to give usthe lawn ornaments.

411
00:21:11 --> 00:21:15
I go back there with lawn ornaments,he'll laugh in my face.

412
00:21:16 --> 00:21:17
It's ridiculous, I mean we had anagreement!

413
00:21:18 --> 00:21:21
Will you say something, Steven?

414
00:21:21 --> 00:21:24
Don't take that tone with me.

415
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
All right, you can.

416
00:21:32 --> 00:21:33
Thank God!

417
00:21:33 --> 00:21:35
You changed your mind.

418
00:21:35 --> 00:21:37
You probably don't wantto talk about it.

419
00:21:37 --> 00:21:40
You're doing the right thing.

420
00:21:40 --> 00:21:41
Where are you going?

421
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
What are you doing?

422
00:21:43 --> 00:21:47
Why am I always pregnantwhen she does that?

423
00:21:48 --> 00:21:49
I'd like to toast Ross and Emily.

424
00:21:50 --> 00:21:51
My big toast is tomorrow.

425
00:21:51 --> 00:21:56
This is kind of my little toastor Melba toast, if you will.

426
00:21:58 --> 00:22:02
I knew Ross when he was going outwith his first girlfriend.

427
00:22:03 --> 00:22:07
I thought things would work outuntil he over-inflated her.

428
00:22:09 --> 00:22:12
Oh, dear God!

429

00:22:38 --> 00:22:41
I'm bored of you now.I'm going to cut you off.

438
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44

449
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
New York City.

450
00:23:26 --> 00:23:29
Where everybody knows my name.

Anyway...

452
00:23:32 --> 00:23:33

453
00:23:33 --> 00:23:37
But not as much as I love America.

454
00:23:37 --> 00:23:40
Can we please go home now?

455
00:23:40 --> 00:23:41
Are you going home?

456
00:23:42 --> 00:23:45
I was hoping to getto know you better.

457
00:23:45 --> 00:23:48
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

458
00:23:51 --> 00:23:53
I was laughing.

459
00:23:53 --> 00:23:56
Out loud?

460
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
I didn't want everyoneto think I was stupid.

461
00:23:59 --> 00:23:59
How are you?

462
00:24:00 --> 00:24:02
My mom's driving me crazy.But Ross is getting married!

463
00:24:03 --> 00:24:05
I'm happy.I won't let anything spoil that.

464
00:24:06 --> 00:24:09
I just want to say thatRoss is a wonderful young man.

465
00:24:09 --> 00:24:11
Thanks. We like him.

466
00:24:11 --> 00:24:16
My God! You must have beena teenager when you had him.

467
00:24:56 --> 00:24:58
There's no way in hellI'm paying for it.

468
00:24:58 --> 00:25:00
Look, we're down to just one point.

469
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
Could we please just settle itafter the wedding?

470
00:25:03 --> 00:25:06
Fine, but I'm not payingfor your wine cellar...

471
00:25:06 --> 00:25:11
...you thieving, would-be-speaking-German-if-it-weren't-for-us man!

472
00:25:13 --> 00:25:18
The guy was hammered. There'sno way you look like Ross' mother.

473
00:25:18 --> 00:25:20
- Then why would he say it?- Because he's crazy!

474
00:25:20 --> 00:25:25
Earlier, he thanked me for my verymoving performance in "Titanic".

475
00:25:26 --> 00:25:28
My mother's right.I'll never get married.

476
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
You know what, that is...

477
00:25:30 --> 00:25:32
Who wouldn't want you?

478
00:25:32 --> 00:25:36
Please! I'm a single momwith a 30-year-old son.

479
00:25:02 --> 00:25:03

480
00:25:03 --> 00:25:04
Hello.

00:25:05 --> 00:25:07
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.

482
00:25:07 --> 00:25:10
Oh I'm afraid that plane has alreadypulled away from the gate.

483
00:25:10 --> 00:25:11
Okay, you know what. You'regoing to have to call that plane

484
00:25:11 --> 00:25:13
and tell them to swing aroundand come and pick me up.

485
00:25:13 --> 00:25:14
I can't do that.

486
00:25:14 --> 00:25:16
Sure, you know what? Comeon, we'll just tell them

487
00:25:16 --> 00:25:18
that there was like a problemwith like the "engine".

488
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask youto step aside, Miss.

489
00:25:23 --> 00:25:25
Look, If I don't get to London... he isgoing to marry that other girl!

490
00:25:25 --> 00:25:28
I can't imagine why.

491
00:25:28 --> 00:25:32
All right, you know what? I am not leavinghere, until you call that plane back!

492
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41

Hi Ross.

494
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46

495
00:25:47 --> 00:25:50
Do you think he knew I was here?

496
00:25:55 --> 00:25:58
I've never done that with you before.

497
00:25:59 --> 00:26:01
So how are you?

498
00:26:01 --> 00:26:03
You okay?

You?

500
00:26:06 --> 00:26:08
You?

501
00:26:08 --> 00:26:11

502
00:26:14 --> 00:26:17
- I better get going.- Absolutely.

503
00:26:18 --> 00:26:19
Could you not look?

504
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
I don't want to look.

505
00:26:36 --> 00:26:39
Excuse me, if you plan ondoing that the entire flight...

506
00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
... tell me now, so thatI can take a sedative.

507
00:26:42 --> 00:26:44
Or maybe slip you one.

508
00:26:49 --> 00:26:51
It's just that I'm kind of excited.

509
00:26:51 --> 00:26:56
I'm going to Londonto tell this guy that I love him.

510
00:27:06 --> 00:27:09
Where the hell have you been?

511
00:27:09 --> 00:27:13
I spent the night out. I metthis cute bridesmaid. She is so...

512
00:27:13 --> 00:27:14
I don't want to hear about her!

513
00:27:14 --> 00:27:17
Pheebs, you know you're stillmy number one girl.

514
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
We have an emergency.Rachel's coming to London.

515
00:27:21 --> 00:27:22
Great!

516
00:27:23 --> 00:27:26
No, she's coming to tell Rossthat she loves him.

517
00:27:26 --> 00:27:27
But he loves Emily.

518
00:27:27 --> 00:27:29
I know that!

519
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
You have to stop her.She's going to ruin the wedding.

520
00:27:32 --> 00:27:33
Okay.

521
00:27:33 --> 00:27:34
All right, so, okay...

522
00:27:34 --> 00:27:43
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming.Do... something.

523
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's

524
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
your responsibility now. Theburden is off me, right?

525
00:27:48 --> 00:27:49
Right.

526
00:27:50 --> 00:27:51
So tell me about this girl.

527
00:27:56 --> 00:27:57
Have you seen Monica?

528
00:27:58 --> 00:28:00
I'm not seeing Monica!

529
00:28:04 --> 00:28:07
We got to find her. Rachel's comingto tell Ross she loves him.

530
00:28:07 --> 00:28:09
- Oh, my God!- Do you know where she is?

531
00:28:09 --> 00:28:14
What's with the third degree?Why not just shine a light in my eyes?

532
00:28:15 --> 00:28:18
Then I realized all this stuffI had been doing...

533
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
...proposing to Joshua,lying about why I couldn't come...

534
00:28:21 --> 00:28:24
...was all just a way of...

535
00:28:24 --> 00:28:25
I'm sorry. Can I interrupt?

536
00:28:26 --> 00:28:31
I just want to say that you area horrible, horrible person.

537

00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
You're about to ruinthe happiest day of his life.

539
00:28:35 --> 00:28:37
I have to agreewith your friend Pheebs.

540
00:28:37 --> 00:28:40
This is a terrible, terrible plan.

541
00:28:40 --> 00:28:43
- But he has to know how I feel.- But why?

542
00:28:43 --> 00:28:46
He loves this Emily.No good can come of this.

543
00:28:46 --> 00:28:48
I think you're wrong.

544
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
Oh, no!

546
00:29:03 --> 00:29:05
Oh, my God!

547
00:29:06 --> 00:29:07
It's like a fairyland.

548
00:29:08 --> 00:29:10
I know. It's horrible, isn't it?

549
00:29:10 --> 00:29:13

550
00:29:13 --> 00:29:16

Start looking out for Rachel.

552
00:29:19 --> 00:29:22
I'll cover the door.You watch that big hole.

553
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
I've got Chandler covering Ross.

554
00:29:24 --> 00:29:26
Why would I care where Chandler is?

555
00:29:26 --> 00:29:29
You know...

556
00:29:29 --> 00:29:32
...sometimes I don't evenlike Chandler.

557
00:29:35 --> 00:29:36
I do.

558
00:29:36 --> 00:29:38

559
00:29:39 --> 00:29:40
It's the second one.

00:29:45 --> 00:29:48
Hey, Felicity.

563
00:29:48 --> 00:29:51
I thought about you all day.

564
00:29:51 --> 00:29:53
Talk New York to me again.

565
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
Forget about it.

566
00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
How you doing?

567
00:30:00 --> 00:30:02
We're not payingfor your wine cellar.

568
00:30:02 --> 00:30:04
You have to meet me in the middle.

569
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
My foot will meetthe middle of your ass.

570
00:30:08 --> 00:30:11
- What's going on?- Everything's under control.

571
00:30:11 --> 00:30:14
You want a piece of me?Is that what you're saying?

572
00:30:15 --> 00:30:15
That's it!

573
00:30:16 --> 00:30:17
Parents! Parents!Back away!

574
00:30:18 --> 00:30:19
This is our wedding day!

575
00:30:19 --> 00:30:21
From now on, everyone gets along.

576
00:30:21 --> 00:30:23
And if I hear one more word...

577
00:30:23 --> 00:30:24
...no grandchildren!

578
00:30:24 --> 00:30:26
That's right!

579
00:30:26 --> 00:30:28
Sorry, old boy.

580
00:30:30 --> 00:30:33
I could kill youwith my thumb, you know.

581
00:30:35 --> 00:30:36
What was that about?

582
00:30:36 --> 00:30:40
It was this disagreement over...

583
00:30:40 --> 00:30:43
My God! You look beautiful.

584
00:30:44 --> 00:30:46
You can't see me before the wedding.It's bad luck.

585
00:30:46 --> 00:30:50
I think we've had all the bad luckwe're going to have.

586
00:31:18 --> 00:31:21
My God, Rachel!

587
00:31:22 --> 00:31:25
You're here.I can't believe it.

588
00:31:26 --> 00:31:27
