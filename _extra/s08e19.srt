00:00:02 --> 00:00:06
Hi. So I'm doing the "Soap Opera Digest"crossword puzzle...

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
...and guess who is the cluefor three down?

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
"Days of Our Lives" star,blank Tribbiani."

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
That's me! I'm blank!

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
How cool! We know three down!I'm touching three down.

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
Yeah, you are, baby.

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
Three down knows I'm married.What's three down doing?

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
Do they call to tell you you're in it?

9
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
No. They wanted to doa profile on me. I said no.

10
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
Why'd you say no?

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
Remember the last interview I did?

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
I said I write my own lines,the writers got mad...

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
...and I fell down an elevator shaft.Who knows what I'd say now?

14
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
If only there was somethingin your head to control what you say.

15
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
Come on, you'll keep itin check this time.

16
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
The publicity would be good for you.You deserve that.

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
In the interview, you could mention,I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

19
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
- Okay, don't listen to him. Please?- Fine, all right, I'll do it.

20
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
You have to be there to stop meif I say something stupid.

21
00:01:06 --> 00:01:10
Just then, or all the time?Because we have jobs, you know?

22
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
We'll be there the whole time.Just remember:

23
00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
Gal pal, Rachel Green.

24
00:01:17 --> 00:01:21
I'm gonna be in "Soap Opera Digest"!And not just in the dumb crossword.

25
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
Seriously, proud of you.

29
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
- Thanks for taking the time for this.- Not at all. Happy to do it.

30
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
You think we're being obvious?

31
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
No. We're just four people withneck problems, who talk like this.

32
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
It's great that we met here.

33
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
When people hear the magazine's paying,they want a big, fancy restaurant.

34
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
Actually, I didn't knowthe magazine was paying.

35
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
Wouldn't have mattered. I do thisfor the fans, not the free food.

36
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
- Can I get you anything?- Coffee.

37
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
And I'll have all the muffins.

38
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
- Hey.- We're not talking.

39
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
Oh, finally.

40
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
According to your bio,you've done quite a bit of work.

41
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Anything that you'reparticularly proud of?

42
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
All you want is a dingle

43
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
What you envy's a shwang

44
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
A thing through which you can tinkle

45
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
"Or play with", "or simply let hang"

46
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
You want a glass of milk...

47
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
are so hard to open!

48
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
"Boy", "you said it", "Mike."

49
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
- There's gotta be a better way!"- There is", "Kevin!"

50
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
he's ever used this. It's easy.

51
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
- It is easy.

52
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
Now I can have milk every day.

53
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
So this is it, Victor?

54
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
Yeah, I guess it is. And so...

55
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

56
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7in search of alternative fuels.

57
00:03:45 --> 00:03:50
But when I return 200 years from now,you'll be long gone.

58
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
But I won't have aged at all.

59
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up.

60
00:04:01 --> 00:04:02
Because, Adrian...

61
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
...baby...

62
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

63
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Here I come.I'm coming to fix the copier.

64
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
I can't get to the copier.I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

65
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
So I just watch them have sex.And then I say... Wait, here's my line:

66
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
for the paper tray.

67
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
- Nice work, my friend.- Wait, you see me again.

68
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

69
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
There I am. There I am. There I am.

70
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
There are so many things,it's hard to pick just one.

71
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
I'm getting coffee. Want anything?

72
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
- A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.- Double latte.

73
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
- A bagel with only...- I was just being polite.

74
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
How about when you're not working?What do you do in your spare time?

75
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
Look at this clown. He thinkshe can take up the whole river.

76
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
Get out of the way, jackass!

77
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
Who names their boat"Coast Guard", anyway?

78
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
That is the Coast Guard.

79
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
What are they doing out here?The coast is way over there!

80
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
This is unbelievable.

81
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
Joey has been holding his breathfor almost four minutes.

82
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
Dude, are you trying to kill me?

83
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
Well, I see you've hada very productive day.

84
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
- Isn't the cowboy hat a little much?- Come on, it's fun!

85
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
All right.

86
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
Isn't this a woman's hat?

87
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
Dude, stop talking crazyand make us some tea.

88
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
We have to turn off the porn.

89
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
I think you're right.

90
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
- All right, ready?- One.

91
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
- Two, three.- Three.

92
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
That's kind of nice.

93
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
- It's kind of a relief.- Yeah.

94
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
- You wanna see if we still have it?- Yeah.

95
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
Free porn! We have free porn here!

96
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
In my spare time, I read to the blind.

97
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
And I'm also a mento for kids.

98
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
- A mento?- You know, a mento. A role model.

99
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
- A mento?- Right.

100
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
- Like the candy?- As a matter of fact, I do.

101
00:06:36 --> 00:06:41
Our readers always want to know howsoap stars stay in such great shape.

102
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
Do you have a fitness regime?

103
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
We stars usually just try to eat rightand get lots of exercise.

104
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
You know we've thrown thiswithout dropping it for an hour?

105
00:06:51 --> 00:06:52
Are you serious?

106
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
I realized it a half-hour ago,but I didn't want to jinx it.

107
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
- Wow, we are pretty good at this.- Yeah.

108
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

109
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
That's the first timeI've ever missed a meal.

110
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
My pants are a little loose.

111
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
What's wrong with you?

112
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
I got this blinding pain in my stomachwhen I was lifting weights.

113
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
And then I passed out.

114
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
I haven't been able to stand up since.But I don't think it's serious.

115
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
Sounds like a hernia.Go to the doctor.

116
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
No way!

117
00:07:24 --> 00:07:29
If I go to the doctor, it's for thisthing sticking out of my stomach!

118
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
Why'd I have to startworking out again?

119
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
Damn you, fifteens!

120
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
- What is it?- A trifle. It has layers.

121
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
A layer of ladyfingers,then a layer of jam.

122
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
Then custard,which I made from scratch.

123
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
Raspberries, more ladyfingers,beef sauteed with peas and onions.

124
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
Then a little bit more custard.

125
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
It tastes like feet.

126
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
I like it.

127
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
- Are you kidding?- What's not to like? Custard, good.

128
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
Jam, good. Meat, good!

129
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

130
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
Well, the fridge broke,so I had to eat everything.

131
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

132
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

133
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
- That's still in there?- Not anymore.

134
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
This piece doesn't have floor on it.

135
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
- Stick to your side.- Hey, come on, now.

136
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
All right, what are we having?

137
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
I don't believe in these crazy diets.Just everything in moderation.

138
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
Your muffins.

139
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
I'll take those to go.

140
00:08:49 --> 00:08:50
For the kids.

141
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
I know what I wanted to ask.

142
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
They killed you off years ago.What happened there?

143
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
I said some stuff in an interviewI shouldn't have said.

144
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
- But that is not gonna happen today.- Understood.

145
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
- So, what'd you say back then?- I said that l...

146
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
- Hey, Joey!- How you doing?

147
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
This is Shelly. She's interviewing me.Shelly, these are my friends.

148
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.If you want the dirt, come to me.

149
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?

150
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
I'm just kidding.Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.

151
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
Who just lost the respectof her unborn child.

152
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
I'm gonna go get this warmed up.

153
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
- You're doing great.- So far, nothing stupid.

154
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
- Mento?- No, thanks.

155
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
As Joey's friends, is there anythingour readers should know?

156
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
No, just that he is a great guy.

157
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
That'll get youinto "Soap Opera Digest."

158
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
Well, l...

00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
...truly has enrichedthe days of our lives.

161
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01

B as in Beebee.And E as in, "'ello there, mate!"

166

Great. It was nice meeting you.

167
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
- Yeah, you too.- Thanks.

168
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
It seems you have a lot of friends.Who is your best friend?

169
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
How come you have two?

170
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
Well, this one's for you.

171
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
- Get out!- No, I can't.

172
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
I know how much this means to you.This isn't just about jewelry.

173
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
It's about you and meand the fact that we're best buds.

174
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
Is this friendship? I think so!

175
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!

176
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
That's what they'll call us!

177
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
- I'm sorry.- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

178
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
That's gonna leave a stain.

179
00:10:59 --> 00:11:03
Rach, hey, it's fine.You're at Joey's.

180
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
- Really?- Yeah, look.

181
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
- I've never lived like this before.- I know!

182
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
Well, don't waste it.I mean, it's still food. Jeez!

183
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
I feel guilty.I wanna be a good friend...

184
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
...and damn it, I am a good friend.So shut up and close your eyes.

185
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
You are a good friend.

186
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
The audition was this morning,and I didn't get it.

187
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
But that was a hell of a kiss.Rachel is a very lucky girl.

188
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
Let's get the contestantsout of their isolation booths.

189
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
And they're off!

190
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
Get your foot off my contestant!Judge!

191
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
Judge rules: No violation.

192
00:11:51 --> 00:11:56
- The duck gets the Nutter Butter!- No! That's just an old won ton.

193
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
Judge rules: Nutter Butter!

194
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
Tough call.

195
00:12:01 --> 00:12:06
- I saw it on the Discovery Channel.- Wait a minute. I saw that!

196
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
Yeah, about jellyfish,and how if you...

197
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
You peed on yourself?

198
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
You can't say that! You don't know!

199
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
I thought I'd pass out from the pain.

200
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
Anyway, I tried,but I couldn't bend that way.

201
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
So...

202
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
That's right, I stepped up!

203
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
She's my friend and she needed help!

204
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
If I had to,I'd pee on any one of you!

205
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
Nope. No best friend.

206
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
Just a lot of close friends.

207
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
So now back to the show.

208
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
How does it feelto have a huge gay fan base?

209
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
Really? Me?

210
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
Wow, I don't even knowany huge gay people.

211
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.

212
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
Now, off the record, you're not...

213
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
What? Are you referringto my man's bag?

214
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
At first, it just looked good,but it's practical.

215
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
It's got compartments for stuff:Your wallet, your keys.

216
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
Your makeup.

217
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Should I climb down your frontso we're face to face...

218
00:13:24 --> 00:13:29
...or should I climb down your backso we're butt to face?

219
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
- I think face is best.- Yeah, face.

220
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
- Okay, here I come.- All right.

221
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
Oh, my...How much do you weigh, Ross?

222
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
I prefer not to answer that. I'm stillcarrying a little holiday weight.

223
00:13:50 --> 00:13:55
When we said "face to face," we didn'tthink it all the way through!

224
00:13:55 --> 00:13:56
- Hey, Pheebs.- Hey!

225
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
Check it out.

226
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
How much of a man am I?

227
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.

228
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
You're turning into a woman.

229
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16
No, I'm not! Why would you say that?That's just mean!

230
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

231
00:14:20 --> 00:14:23
Not what you said,it's just the way you said it.

232
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!

233
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
- Great nap.- It really was.

234
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
Me? Gay? No. No. No.

235
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
But I have a numberof close friends who are.

236
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
So let's talk about women.

237
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
I'm sure our female readers areinterested in your romantic life.

238
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
What I do is, I look a womanup and down and I say:

239
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
"Hey. How you doing?"

240
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
Oh, please.

241
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
Hey. How you doing?

242
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
Hey. How you doing?

243
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
He has an amazing Porsche under there.

244
00:15:18 --> 00:15:22
I'd love to show you, but I justtucked her in. She's sleeping.

245
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
Would you two girlslike to go for a drink?

246
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
- Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.- Oh, my God! Jill!

247
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
- Oh, my God! Rachel!- Oh, hi!

248
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
- Oh, my God! Introduce us!- Well, this is Chandler.

249
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
You know Monica and Ross.That's Phoebe. That's Joey.

250
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
- Hey, how you doing?- Don't!

251
00:15:46 --> 00:15:50
You're a really nice guy. I'm happyto be your roommate and friend.

252
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
I'm just... You know, I justdon't feel that way about you.

253
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
I see what happened.

254
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
It's because I was tryingto repel you. Right?

255
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
Believe me, you'd feela lot different if I turned it on.

256
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
- I don't think so.- Oh, I do.

257
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
How you doing?

258
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
I'm okay.

259
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
What? Oh, dear God!

260
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
Not much to tell there.I'm really shy.

261
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
So that's it.I guess that's all I need.

262
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
Thank you so much.I think they'll run this next month.

263
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.

264
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
- Bye.- Bye-bye.

265
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
- I did it.- Amazing.

266
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
Wait, I almost forgot.We have to ask everybody this:

267
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
Other than "Days",what's your favorite soap opera?

268
00:16:45 --> 00:16:50
Oh, I don't watch soap operas.Excuse me? I have a life, you know?

269
00:16:51 --> 00:16:55
The readers at "Soap Opera Digest"will be happy to learn that.

270
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
Good enough.

271
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
So close.

272
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
They didn't put in the partabout you not watching soaps.

273
00:17:08 --> 00:17:12
I called the lady and said Iwas joking. She was nice about it.

274
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
- You slept with her, didn't you?- A little bit.

275
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
This picture of you is steamy.

276
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22
That's just a little somethingfor my huge gay fan base.

277
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
- Did you just wink at me?- You're the one who loves the picture.
