1
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
Come in.

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
I've been waiting for you.

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
Hi, I just...

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
Oh, my God!Monica!

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:19
I'm sorry! I was...

7
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
I was taking a nap.

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
Since when do youtake naps in that position?

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.Please tell me.

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
Yes, I was.A guy.

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
From work.

12
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
I'm seeing a guy from work!

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
That cute waiter guy that looks likea non-threatening Ray Liotta?

14
00:00:40 --> 00:00:41
That one!

15
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
Give me a second.I'm just going to grab a jacket.

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
When I get back,I want every little detail.

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Maybe that's him.

18
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
It's just Joey and Ross.

19
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
Why aren't you at the movie?

20
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
Ross was so loud, they threw us out.

21
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
I had to talk loudbecause the movie was loud!

22
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
- He's talking to London.- Did he get in touch with Emily?

23
00:01:08 --> 00:01:12
No, not yet. He's hoping that someonewill help him get in touch with her.

24
00:01:13 --> 00:01:18
I don't care if I said someother girl's name, you prissy old twit!

25
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
Way to suck up to the family!

26
00:01:26 --> 00:01:31
I'm so glad you're all here. My officefinally got wrinkle-free fax paper!

27
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS

28
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
No, no! Vomit tux!

29
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Don't worry,I had it dry-cleaned.

30
00:02:16 --> 00:02:17
Vomit tux?

31
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Who vomited on...

32
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
You know what?What you up to, Joe?

33
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
They're doingthis telethon thing on TV.

34
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
And my agentgot me a job as cohost!

35
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
That's great!

36
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
A little good deed for PBS,plus some TV exposure.

37
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
That's the kind of mathJoey likes to do.

38
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
Oh, PBS!

39
00:02:36 --> 00:02:40
- What's wrong with PBS?- What's right with them?

40
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
Why don't you like PBS?

41
00:02:41 --> 00:02:46
Right after my Mom killed herself,I was in a bad place, personally.

42
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
I thought I'd writeto "Sesame Street".

43
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
Because they were nicewhen I was a little kid.

44
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
No one ever wrote back.

45
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
A lot of those muppetsdon't have thumbs.

46
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
All I got was a lousy keychain, andby that time, I was living in a box.

47
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
I didn't have keys!

48
00:03:03 --> 00:03:04
I'm sorry, Pheebs.

49
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
I wanted to do a good deed,like you did with the babies.

50
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
This isn't a good deed. You justwant to get on TV. This is selfish.

51
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
What about you havingthose babies for your brother?

52
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
That's selfish!

53
00:03:17 --> 00:03:18
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
It was a nice thing,but it made you feel good, right?

55
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
Yeah, so?

56
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
It made you feel goodso that makes it selfish.

57
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
Look, there's nounselfish good deeds. Sorry.

58
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
Yes, there are totallygood deeds that are selfless!

59
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
May I ask for one example?

60
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
Yeah, it's...You know, there's...

61
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
No, you may not!

62
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
Because all people are selfish.

63
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
Are you calling me selfish?

64
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
Are you calling you people?

65
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs,but selfless good deeds don't exist.

66
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
You know the dealon Santa Claus?

67
00:03:52 --> 00:03:57
I'll find a selfless good deed.I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!

68
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Oh, my God! It's Emily!

69
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
It's Emily, everyone!

70
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
I'm only ringing to saystop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.

71
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
You can hang up, but I'll keep callingeveryone in England...

72
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
...if that's what it takesto get you to talk to me.

73
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
Really? About what?

74
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
Look, you're my wife.We're married.

75
00:04:21 --> 00:04:22
You know, I love you.

76
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
I really miss you.

77
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
I miss you too.

78
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
At least, I think I do.

79
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
She's talking.

80
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
When you said "the deal with Santa",you meant...?

81
00:04:37 --> 00:04:38
That he doesn't exist.

82
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
Right.

83
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
Chandler, have you heardabout Monica's secret boyfriend?

84
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.

85
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
So, Mon, when are we goingto meet this new, secret waiter man?

86
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
I don't think he'sup to meeting everyone yet.

87
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
Yeah, I don't think he's up to it.

88
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
I want to meet this guywho's the best sex she ever had.

89
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
Really?

90
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
That's what you heard?You said that?

91
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
I might have.

92
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Why is that funny?

93
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
Because I'm very happy for him.

94
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
And you!You lucky dog!

95
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
She's willing to workon the relationship.

96
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
That's great!

97
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
In London.

98
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
She wants me to move to London.

99
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
But you live here.

100
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
You know that.

101
00:05:34 --> 00:05:35
What will you do?

102
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...

103
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
...I could convince themto move to London with Ben.

104
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
I'm sure your ex-wifewould be more than happy to move...

105
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
...so you can patch things upwith your new wife.

106
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
It could happen.

107
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
How you doing? Welcome.Good to see you.

108
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
This'll be your phone.

109
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
That's great.

110
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
But I'm not reallyexpecting a lot of calls.

111
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
No, you answer itand take pledges.

112
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
But I'm the host.

113
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
Gary Collins is the host.You'll be answering the phone.

114
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
You don't seem to understand.I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

115
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
Well, here's your phone, Doctor.

116
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
I can't believe I can't finda selfless good deed.

117
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
You know that old guythat lives next to me?

118
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
I snuck over there and raked upthe leaves on his front stoop.

119
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
But he caught me, and heforce-fed me cider and cookies.

120
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Then I felt wonderful.That old jackass!

121
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
Maybe Joey's right.Maybe all good deeds are selfish.

122
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
I will find a selfless good deed.I gave birth to three children...

123
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
...and I won't let them be raisedin a world where Joey's right!

124
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
Can I ask you a cooking question?

125
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
If you're cooking on the stove...

126
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
...that means your new boyfriendis better in bed than Richard?

127
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
Is he?

128
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
I think I'll respect the privacyof my new, secret boyfriend.

129
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Why?

130
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
If this guy was me...

131
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
...and it's me who'd learned that it wasme who was the best you'd ever had...

132
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
...I'd be like this:

133
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
All right, Emily.

134
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
As much as I love you...

135
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
...I'm sorry, I can'tmove to London without Ben.

136
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
I understand that would be difficult.

137
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
Would you consider moving here?You were moving here anyway.

138
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
Why can't you just do that?

139
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
I don't know. It's just...

140
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
But I know that even though I've beena complete idiot up till now...

141
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
...you have to come here.

142
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
work this out together.

143
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
All right.

144
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
Did you just say "all right"?

145
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
I did.Now I'm the idiot.

146
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
Emily, that is so great!

147
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
It'll be great!

148
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
We're going to belike two idiots in love!

149
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
There's one thing thatreally scares me still.

150
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
- You must understand...

151
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
...how humiliating it wasfor me at the altar...

152
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
...in front of my family and friends.

153
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
I know. I am so sorry.

154
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
And then, after decidingto forgive you...

155
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
...seeing you at the airport,catching our plane with her.

156
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
Again, very sorry.

157
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
I mean, I can't bein the same room as her.

158
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
It drives me mad thinking of youbeing in the same room as her.

159
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
Emily, there is nothingbetween Rachel and me.

160
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
I love you.

161
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
All right.

162
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
I'll come to New York,and we'll try to make this work.

163
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
That's so great!

164
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
As long as youdon't see Rachel anymore.

165
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
I asked Emilyif she would come to New York.

166
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
And she said yes.

167
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
Great!

168
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
Only if I promisenever to see Rachel again.

169
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
What? You can't...

170
00:08:59 --> 00:09:00
What did you say?

171
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
I'd think about it. How am Isupposed to make this decision?

172
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
I'm actually asking you!

173
00:09:09 --> 00:09:13
Rachel is one of your best friends.

174
00:09:13 --> 00:09:14
But Emily's his wife!

175
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
That's true!

176
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
You can't just cut Rachelout of your life!

177
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
That's true!

178
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
Thanks for the help.Problem solved!

179
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
When will you be on TV?

180
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
There was kind of a mix-upin my agent's office...

181
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
...but I'm still on TV,and that's good exposure.

182
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
You're not on TV.

183
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
How about now?

184
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
There he is!

185
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
Hello, New York!

186
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
Who cares?

187
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
Now I got the legs.

188
00:09:58 --> 00:10:03
How many times have I told youto never watch the cooking channel?

189
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
I need that broiling panthat Joey borrowed.

190
00:10:06 --> 00:10:07
That was yours?

191
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
We used it when the duckwas throwing up caterpillars.

192
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
Williams-Sonoma,fall catalog, page 27.

193
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.

194
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
Joey's at the telethonfor the rest of the day.

195
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
We have the place to ourselves.

196
00:10:22 --> 00:10:23
Yeah, so?

197
00:10:23 --> 00:10:28
Maybe you'd want to book some timewith "the best you've ever had".

198
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
You know what, champ?

199
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
I think I'll pass.

200
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Why?

201
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
What's your point?

202
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
PBS Telethon.

203
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
I just wanted to let you knowthat I found a selfless good deed.

204
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
I went down to the parkand I let a bee sting me.

205
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
What good is that going to do?

206
00:10:59 --> 00:11:03
It helps the bee look toughin front of his bee friends.

207
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
The bee is happy,and I am definitely not.

208
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
You know, the bee probablydied after he stung you.

209
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
Damn it!

210
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
Back on in 30 seconds, people!

211
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
Excuse me,would you mind switching with me?

212
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
No way.I'm in the shot, man.

213
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
- You've been here all day!- I'm taking pledges.

214
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
And we're on three, two...

215
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
Welcome back to our fall telethon.

216
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
Cirque du Soleil...

217
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
...and you'd like to see more,it's very simple.

218
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
All you have to dois call in a pledge...

219
00:11:43 --> 00:11:48
...and tell one of our volunteerswhat type of programming you...

220
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
That's it. I cannot make this decision.It is too difficult.

221
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
I leave it entirelyup to the gods of fate.

222
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
A Magic 8 Ball?

223
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
You can't make this decisionwith a toy!

224
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
It's not a toy.

225
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
I don't know what else to do!

226
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
I either keep my wifeand lose one of my best friends...

227
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
...or I get divorcedfor the second time before I'm 30.

228
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
If anyone else hasa better suggestion, let's hear it.

229
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
Because I got nothing!Don't be shy.

230
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
Any suggestion will do.

231
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
Okay, then.

232
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
Here we go.

233
00:12:31 --> 00:12:32
Magic 8 Ball...

234
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
...should I never see Rachel again?

235
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
"Ask Again Later."

236
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
Later is not good enough!

237
00:12:47 --> 00:12:48
"Ask Again Later."

238
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
What the hell?

239
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
This is broken! It is broken!

240
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
Let me see.

241
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
Will Chandler have sex tonight?

242
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
"Don't Count On It."

243
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
Seems like it works to me.

244
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
PBS Telethon.

245
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
Hi, Joey.

246
00:13:08 --> 00:13:09
Hey, Pheebs.

247
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
I'd liketo make a pledge.

248
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
I would like to donate $200.

249
00:13:12 --> 00:13:13
Two hundred dollars?

250
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
You sure?After what "Sesame Street" did to you?

251
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
I'm still mad at them,but they bring happiness...

252
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
...to lots of kidswhose moms didn't kill themselves.

253
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
By supporting them, I'm doing a goodthing, but I'm not happy about it.

254
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
So there!A selfless good deed.

255
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
You don't feel goodabout donating the money?

256
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
No, it sucks!I was saving up to buy a hamster.

257
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
A hamster?Those things are, like, $10.

258
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
Not the one I had my eye on.

259
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
last year's pledge total.

260
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
Thank you!

261
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
was taken by one of our volunteers.

262
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.

263
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!

264
00:13:54 --> 00:13:55
Oh, look!

265
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
Joey's on TV!

266
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
Isn't that great?

267
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
My pledge got Joey on TV!That makes me feel so...

268
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
Oh, no!

269
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
Look...

270
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
...I got carried away before,but there's something you got to know.

271
00:14:12 --> 00:14:17
If I'm the best, it's onlybecause you made me the best.

272
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
Keep talking.

273
00:14:20 --> 00:14:21
I was nothing before you.

274
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
Call the other girls and ask.

275
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
Which wouldn't take long.

276
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
But when I'm with you,and we're together...

277
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
...oh, my God!

278
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
Oh, my God!

279
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
I understand if you neverwant to sleep with me again.

280
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
But that'd be wrong.

281
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
We're too good.

282
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
We owe it to sex!

283
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
If we owe it!

284
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
Oh, my!

285
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
When will Joey be home?

286
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
I was kind of hopingwe could do this without him.

287
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
No, no, no!Leave the gloves on.

288
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
I cleaned the bathroom.

289
00:15:06 --> 00:15:09
Why don't we lose the gloves.

290
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
All right.Let's show them how it's done.

291
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
- That wasn't part of it.- I know.

292
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
You ready?We're going to be late.

293
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
- For what?- For Stella, remember?

294
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
She's getting her groove backin 20 minutes.

295
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
I totally forgot about that.

296
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
Can I take a rain check?I'm waiting for a call from Emily.

297
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
Sure, I guess.

298
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
I hear you don't have togo to London.

299
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
It's not that easy. There's stilla lot of relationship stuff.

300
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
Like what?

301
00:15:55 --> 00:15:56
Just stuff.

302
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
You know, kind of what Emily wants.

303
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
Talk to me.Maybe I can help.

304
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
You can't help.

305
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
I have to do thiswithout your help.

306
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
I know you can do that too.I'm just saying if you need to talk...

307
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
Thanks.

308
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
Whatever it is that Emily wants...

309
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
...just give it to her.

310
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
The bottom line is that you love her.

311
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
Fix whatever she wants fixed.

312
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
Just do it.

313
00:16:34 --> 00:16:39
You're going to have to try.You'll hate yourself if you don't.

314
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
Come on, answer it!

315
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
Hi, sweetie.

316
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
Good.

317
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
Yes, I've been thinking...

318
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
...about that thingyou wanted me to do.

319
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
I can do it.

320
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
Will you come to New York?

321
00:17:36 --> 00:17:39
- Never done that before.- Nope.
