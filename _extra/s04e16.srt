1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
What is it?

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
I can't find anything to eat.Everything makes me nauseous.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
Being pregnant is no piece of cake.Oh, cake!

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
Honey, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
What is that smell?It's coming from the bathroom.

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:22
Pregnancy does give yousome weird cravings.

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:27
It's me. Listen, there'ssomething in here I want to eat.

8
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
What smells so good?

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
Is it the shampoo?It's guava.

10
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Wait.

11
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
Is it my bologna sandwich?

12
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
I can't believe it! The babywants bologna. I can't eat meat.

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
Wait!

14
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
Maybe it's the pickle!

15
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
The One with the Fake Party

16
00:01:29 --> 00:01:30
What are you writing?

17
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
Joshua's coming in, and sinceI don't have the guts to ask him out...

18
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
...I'll sell him a coatand put this note in the pocket.

19
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.Guys like you...

20
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
...never go out of style."

21
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
What did you throw away?

22
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
- Hi, guys.- What have you been up to?

23
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
We went to see a collection ofVictorian doorknobs at the museum.

24
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
Without me?

25
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
My uncle dragged us there,but it turned out to be interesting.

26
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
They were so ornate and beautiful.Look at that.

27
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
I don't know about England, but here,you're not supposed to take stuff.

28
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
I got it from the gift shop.

29
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
They have really lax security.

30
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
It's a joke.

31
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
I've got to be off.See you.

32
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
You're having a good time.

33
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
She is amazing,and she's so much fun.

34
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
And you know what?When I'm with her, I'm fun!

35
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
I even signed upfor helicopter classes.

36
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
She's leaving in two days.I don't have to do it.

37
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
In two days?You must be bummed.

38
00:02:36 --> 00:02:40
She's got to go back,but I've been prepared for this.

39
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
We knew we had two weeks togetherand then that's it.

40
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
That's what allmy relationships are like.

41
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
But in Ross' case,they both know two weeks is it.

42
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
Yeah, I know. I know!

43
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
The baby is totally craving meat.

44
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
I made it a soy burger, so thatit'd think it was getting meat.

45
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
And I got nauseous.

46
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
Maybe that's because soy burgers suck!

47
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
Pregnancy is hard on your tummy.

48
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
But you got thatcool pregnant-lady glow.

49
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
You throw up all morning,you'll have that glow too.

50
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
- Here's that trench coat you wanted.- Great.

51
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
It's comfortable.

52
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
You could reallyflash somebody in this.

53
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
Don't put your hands in the pocketsuntil you are out of the store.

54
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
Why not?

55
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
Well, because...

56
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
...we get a lot of...

57
00:03:41 --> 00:03:42
They ruin it for everybody.

58
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
I know.

59
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
I wore that sweateron a date last night.

60
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
It was the first datesince the divorce.

61
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
Congratulations.So do you love her?

62
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
She's nice,but it made me realize...

63
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
...I'm just not ready to be dating.

64
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
That's interesting.

65
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
- What was that?- Just an anti-theft device.

66
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
Then what's this?

67
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
You need that too, becausea thief could just tear this up.

68
00:04:16 --> 00:04:21
We have to have a party in five minutes,so everybody cancel your plans.

69
00:04:21 --> 00:04:22
What's going on?

70
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
We have to havea bon voyage party for Emily.

71
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
But it's actually for Joshua.

72
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
He said he's not ready to date.

73
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
So I had to invite him to a party.

74
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
And now I have createdthe perfect opportunity to seduce him.

75
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
As much as I'd liketo meet Josh and warn him...

76
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
...Emily and I won't be here.She'll come by to say goodbye.

77
00:04:44 --> 00:04:49
I've got a special evening planned.Sorry. No party.

78
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
Surprise!

79
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
Surprise!

80
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
No one's thrown mea surprise party before.

81
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
Well, it was all Ross' idea.

82
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
You're so sweet.

83
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
And I'm so surprised.

84
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
You didn't know?

85
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
Why are you hereif Joshua's over there?

86
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
I'm trying to play hard-to-get.

87
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
Quick! Say something funny.

88
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
Like what?

89
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
What's so funny?

90
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
"Like what?"

91
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Now that's a thinker.

92
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
This playing-hard-to-get thingis not working.

93
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
Hand me those cherries.

94
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
- Care for a cherry?- No, thanks.

95
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54
I can tie one of these into a knotusing just my tongue.

96
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
You okay?

97
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
All right?

98
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
We should probably get going soon.

99
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
But the party's just getting started.

100
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
We have to be at The Four Seasonsfor drinks in 15 minutes.

101
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
Then The Plaza for dinner.

102
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
Why did you plan a partyat the same time?

103
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
Actually, American surprise partiesare very short.

104
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
It's usually, "Surprise!"Then, "My God, I'm so surprised. Bye!"

105
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
But I'm having such a great time.

106
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
Your sister told me thatyou dressed up like old ladies...

107
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
...and hosted make-believetea parties.

108
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Monica said that, did she?

109
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
Then what are you goingto put on top of that?

110
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
A little salami.

111
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
What goes on top of the salami?

112
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Pastrami.

113
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
You're a genius.

114
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Give me a hand with the zipper.

115
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
Up!

116
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
- You changed?- I just needed my lucky dress.

117
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
- Lucky means more cleavage?- It does for me.

118
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
Look at him!He's so cute.

119
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
I just want to grab him and kiss him.

120
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
How could I kiss himwithout him knowing I like him?

121
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
I know how you can get him.Take off your bra.

122
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
- Flashdance.

123
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
- With that plumber girl?- A welder.

124
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
Were you, like, in the movie?

125
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
She takes off her bra under the shirtand pulls it out the sleeve.

126
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
Very sexy. And classy.

127
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
- Or you could use mistletoe.- It's not Christmas.

128
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
- Spin the bottle.- He's not 11.

129
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Thank you.It was so thoughtful of you.

130
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
You're leaving?

131
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
- We have something we have to get to.- I'll take off too.

132
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
You can't leave yet.You have to stay.

133
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
We've got the wholebig thing planned.

134
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
What big thing?

135
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
Spin-The-Bottle works like this:I spin.

136
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
Lands on Gunther,so I'd kiss Gunther.

137
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24
Who wants to go first?

138
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
I'll go.

139
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
Welcome to America.

140
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
Oh, my God!

141
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
Two in a row!Use your tongues now.

142
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
All right.

143
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
What are the odds?

144
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
That's enough!

145
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
Let's let someone else play.

146
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
If you didn't want to play,why'd you come?

147
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
Okay, my turn!

148
00:09:05 --> 00:09:06
Look at that!

149
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
Oh, my God.

150
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
The baby just kicked!

151
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
If it kicked once, it'll kick again!

152
00:09:18 --> 00:09:23
Everybody just rememberwhere they were sitting.

153
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
It was a bug.

154
00:09:33 --> 00:09:34
It doesn't matterhow much I'm craving it.

155
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
I'll never eat meat.It's cold-blooded murder.

156
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!

157
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
What are you doing?

158
00:09:48 --> 00:09:49
I can't help it!

159
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
I need the meat!The baby needs the meat.

160
00:09:52 --> 00:09:57
When you date, you don't want to cheatunless it's with someone really hot.

161
00:09:59 --> 00:09:59
Totally.

162
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
This is the same kind of deal.

163
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
If you do something wrong...

164
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
...do it right.

165
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
Feel better?

166
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
Yeah, but at what cost?

167
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
Six months, three meals a day?

168
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
I am going to eat like,you know, millions of cows.

169
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
What if I even things outfor you, meat-wise?

170
00:10:26 --> 00:10:27
I eat a lot of meat, right?

171
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
But suppose, until the baby's born,I laid off it.

172
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
No extra animals would die.You'd be eating my animals.

173
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
I can't believe you'd do that for me.

174
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
Absolutely!I could be a vegetarian.

175
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
There's no meat in beer, right?

176
00:10:42 --> 00:10:47
We can still make dinnerif we skip the appetizers.

177
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
We can't go now.Rachel is going to put on a skit.

178
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
Oh, my God!Have you lost your mind?

179
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
I am finally thinking clearly.

180
00:11:00 --> 00:11:01
My lucky dress wasn't working.

181
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
But for four years,this baby never missed.

182
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
Wait, I can't let...

183
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
Actually, I want to see what happens.

184
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
Nice costume.

185
00:11:15 --> 00:11:20
Well, I wanted to give Emilya big American goodbye cheer.

186
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
Ready.

187
00:11:25 --> 00:11:26
Give me an "E"!

188
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
Give me an "M"!

189
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
Give me an "I"!

190
00:11:29 --> 00:11:30
Give me an "L"!

191
00:11:30 --> 00:11:31
Give me a "Y"!

192
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
What do you get?

193
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
That's me as a cheerleader!

194
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
I loosened a tooth.It's no big deal. I have a dentist.

195
00:11:46 --> 00:11:50
I'll put some ice on it.Excuse me.

196
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
What do I do now?

197
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
I think you're done.

198
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
Time to take off the bra.

199
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
That was really great.

200
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
But I got to take off.

201
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
Take the bra off.

202
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
Let's go get your coat.

203
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
Rachel's my girlfriend.

204
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
So this was really fun.

205
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
Yeah, it was real fun.

206
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
You know, this bra...

207
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
...is really bothering me.

208
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
This used to be my bedroom.

209
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
A lot of memories in here.Lot of memories.

210
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
If these walls could talk,they'd say:

211
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
"Want to hear some memories?"

212
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
Need a hand?

213
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
I got this all under control.

214
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
You really don't seem like you do.

215
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
God! Forget it!

216
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
This is not howthis was supposed to happen.

217
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
What was supposed to happen?

218
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
Can you not look at me?

219
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
I thought thatif I could get you here...

220
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
...I could seduce you.

221
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
I don't wear suits to work.

222
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
And I bought six of them from you.

223
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
I'm sorry.I thought you needed them.

224
00:13:32 --> 00:13:37
My point is, I kept coming backbecause I wanted to see you.

225
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
Because I like you.

226
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
You like me?

227
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
I mean, you're beautifuland smart and sophisticated.

228
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
A lot of this isn't based on tonight.

229
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
But you like me?

230
00:13:51 --> 00:13:56
I can't believe this. All this time,I liked you and you liked me!

231
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
No "but".

232
00:13:57 --> 00:14:02
"But" is never good. Let's leave itat "I like you and you like me."

233
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
- However...- No, that's a fancy "but".

234
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
My marriage, like, just ended.

235
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
And I'm really not readyto get into anything yet.

236
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
I'm sorry.I just need a little time.

237
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
There you are.I was looking for you.

238
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
Joshua's gone,so you and Emily are free to go.

239
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
It's okay.

240
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
She's still in thereenjoying her fake party.

241
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
It's too late to dothe stuff I had planned.

242
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
I'm sorry.I ruined your evening.

243
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
If it makes you feel any better,I made a fool of myself.

244
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
Helps a little.

245
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
Is there room therefor a pathetic loser?

246
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
Have a seat.

247
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
I'm so sorry.

248
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
It's okay.

249
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
It was just a two-week thing anyway.

250
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
I just didn't want itto end this way.

251
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

252
00:15:14 --> 00:15:15
What do you mean?

253
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
You seem to really like her.

254
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
I really do.

255
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
What am I going to do?We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

256
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
No commitment.

257
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
That girl just spent the entire eveningtalking to your friends...

258
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
...asking to hear stories about you...

259
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
...Iooking throughMonica's photo albums.

260
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
You don't do thatif you're just in it for two weeks.

261
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
You think?

262
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
You've got 14 hoursuntil she has to be at the airport.

263
00:15:48 --> 00:15:49
And you're sitting herein a hallway...

264
00:15:50 --> 00:15:53
...with a 28-year-old cheerleaderwith a fat lip.

265
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
You're right.

266
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
What photo album was it?

267
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
It was youand a bunch of albino kids.

268
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
Oh, my God!Those weren't albino kids.

269
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
That was computer camp!

270
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
You're a pathetic loser, right?

271
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Sit!

272
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
Oh, my God. Joshua.

273
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
All those things I saidabout not being ready...

274
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
- They're not true?- They're all true.

275
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
But...

276
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
I love that "but".

277
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
Do you want to go insideand get some coffee?

278
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
Every time.

279
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
- What do you got there?- Pastrami.

280
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
- You know what goes good with that?- Corned beef.

281
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
I was going to say bologna.But that's better.

282
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
How about that smoked turkey?

283
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
Oh, mama!

284
00:17:29 --> 00:17:32
- When is the baby due?- Six months.

285
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
If a cow died of natural causes,I could have one of those, right?

286
00:17:36 --> 00:17:39
Not if I get there first.
