00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
That stuff about Rachel?

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:13
You're fine. You're better than fine.

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
"You are", "as your friend Tony""would say", "Great!"

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
Everything's normal."She's just your friend", "Rachel."

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:27
Your friend. Rachel.

00:00:27 --> 00:00:32

10
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
Are you...? Are you high?

11
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
I had the most amazing bath.

12
00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
- Really? I don't like baths.- You like them with me.

13
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.It's the wet, naked lady.

14
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
- Baths are so relaxing.- Really? What do you do?

15
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
You just sit in there,stewing in your own filth.

16
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
How dirty do you think I am?

17
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
If you had some candles and bubblesand music, you'd love it.

18
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
It'd take all your stress away.

19
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
It's 2:00 on Wednesday, I'm watching"Road Rules." How stressed am I?

20
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
Hey, Chandler.I really need to talk to you.

21
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
Is this a cold pizzaor a leftover-meat loaf talk?

22
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
- Well, neither.- Oh, my God, what's up?

23
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
I don't know. It's just...Lately, I've been feeling...

24
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
Okay, here's what it is.

25
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
- I feel a lot better. Thanks.- Wait a minute. Just come back.

26
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
You and Monica,friends for a long time.

27
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
And sure, there are rules.But then you went to London.

28
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
But that's different. There are rulesthere too, know what I mean?

29
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
Do you?

30
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
It was different for you guys.You were both in the same place.

31
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
Yes, when Monica and I werein London, we were both in London.

32
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
This is a bad idea.Forget all about it.

33
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
This conversation between you and me.

34
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
If that.

35
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Ross, don't forgetthat doctor's appointment.

36
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
- Right.- To find out the sex of the baby?

37
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
We don't wanna knowas long as it's happy and healthy.

38
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
Yep, healthy. And cute.

39
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
- Smart. With an aptitude for science.- Popular.

40
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
Are you two talkingabout the same baby?

41
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
- Have you thought of names?- I've come up with a bunch.

42
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
- Really? Me too.- Me too.

43
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
Really?

44
00:03:09 --> 00:03:13
If it's a girl, Phoebe.And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

45
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurtto have a backup, you know?

46
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
Rach, what were you thinking?

47
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
I was thinking if it's a girl...

48
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
...how about Sandrene? It's French.

49
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
That's a really pretty namefor an industrial solvent.

50
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
- Fine. What do you have?- It's for a boy.

51
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
I know it's a little out there, but...

52
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
...Darwin.

53
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
Our child will be beatenin the schoolyard.

54
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
Yeah, by Sandrene.

55
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
You're saying thatbecause I said no to you.

56
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
I'm really, really not.

57
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
How about you each get five vetoes?

58
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
- That sounds fair.- I don't think you'll need it.

59
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
If it's a girl, Rain.

60
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
- Veto.- Why?

61
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.

62
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
I have my own kiln,and my dress is made out of wheat."

63
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
I know her!

64
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
I bought a homemade soapfrom her at a Dead show!

65
00:04:16 --> 00:04:21
- Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?- Why do you hate our child?

66
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
- Fine, you go.- Okay. James.

67
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
- But only if it's a girl.- Veto.

68
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
I like Ruth. What about Ruth?

69
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
Oh, I'm sorry.Are we having an 89-year-old?

70
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
- How about Dayton?- Veto. Stewart.

71
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
Veto. Sawyer.

72
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
- Veto. Helen.- Veto.

73
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
Is it me, or is Veto startingto sound really good?

74
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.

75
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
Sex on the balcony?

76
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
No. But someone's not gonnaget over that idea.

77
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
- What?- I drew you a bath.

78
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
I don't like baths. Could you draw mea picture of sex on the balcony?

79
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
Try it for me.I used all my best stuff.

80
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
I lit candles, I put on music.I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

81
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
And got you this little plasticNavy ship! So it's a boy bath.

82
00:05:11 --> 00:05:16
- This does butch it up a bit.- I swear, you will love it.

83
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
If I do this,can we discuss balcony sex?

84
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
Absolutely.

85
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
But I know howthat discussion's gonna go.

86
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
I like the flowery smell.

87
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
because I've got my boat.

88
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
- So?- Oh, my God.

89
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
I told you you were a bath person.Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.

90
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

91
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
I don't think you hadan open mind about Ruth.

92
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
Little Ruthie Geller?How cute is that?

93
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
Oh, my God, I can practicallyhear the mahjong tiles.

94
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
All your tests look fine. Are youinterested in the sex of the baby?

95
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
- No, we're not.- You have it right there?

96
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
You know if it's a boy or a girl?Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?

97
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
But if you don't wanna know...

98
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
- No, we wanna wait. Right?- Right. Right.

99
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
Oh, I'll be right back.

100
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
I know it's really not my place...

101
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
...but please don't nameyour child Pheebo.

102
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
So, which of these babiesis the ugliest?

103
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

104
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
They're babies.They're all beautiful.

105
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
- Third one from the left?- Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

106
00:06:48 --> 00:06:53
I think it knows I'm talking about it.Don't you...? You're looking!

107
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
- I didn't!- I saw you!

108
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Fine, I did,but I didn't see anything.

109
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

110
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
- But I didn't...- Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!

111
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
I couldn't, because I don't know!

112
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
I swear I didn't see anything!It was just a momentary lapse.

113
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
Don't you have any self-control?

114
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
Okay. A couple months lateon the lecture, Ross.

115
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
Hello?

116
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
Can you come in here?There's something wrong.

117
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
You know what?I think I'll wait out here.

118
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
I'm in the bathtub.

119
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
- What's wrong?- I drew a bath, but I did it wrong.

120
00:07:34 --> 00:07:39
The water's tepid, the salt didn'tdissolve and is now lodged places.

121
00:07:39 --> 00:07:44
And the scents I used don't complimenteach other. Eucalyptus and chamomile?

122
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
- What?- Bath salts.

123
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
They're starting to effervesce.

124
00:07:48 --> 00:07:53
It's different. It's interesting.

125
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
Let's talk about something else.

126
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
Yeah. Sure. So, what wasgoing on with you today?

127
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
I actually had the weirdestconversation with Joey.

128
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
He was talking about rulesand right and wrong.

129
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
- I had the same conversation.- What was he talking about?

130
00:08:09 --> 00:08:14
He hasn't had this much trouble gettingout words since he was in "Macbeth."

131
00:08:14 --> 00:08:19
- That was a long night.- What exactly did he say to you?

132
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
He was talking about rulesand looking at people differently.

133
00:08:24 --> 00:08:25
- Not to me.- What'd he tell you?

134
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
He asked about you, me and London.

135
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
And the glue that holdsthis all together, the rules.

136
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
Okay. So you, me and London.

137
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
Looking at people differently.

138
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
Maybe he wants to dowhat you and I did in London.

139
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
But what'd he mean by "rules"?

140
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
Wait. He stopped talkingthe minute Phoebe came in.

141
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
- He's looking at her differently.- Phoebe is his friend.

142
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
That'd be breaking the rules.

143
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
My God, he wants to do itwith Phoebe in London!

144
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
- You guys?- Just a minute!

145
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
- That's Mrs. Tribbiani.- You don't say anything.

146
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
Why would I? That two of our friendscould start a great love affair?

147
00:09:05 --> 00:09:09
They'd have me to thank.Then we could all start having babies!

148
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
- I won't let you say anything.- Stay here.

149
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
Oh, God!

150
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
I brought back your iron.

151
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
I thought I lost it.I got a new one a month ago.

152
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.

153
00:09:28 --> 00:09:29
- What?- Nothing.

154
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
I really shouldn't say.I'm really not supposed to.

155
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
Fine.

156
00:09:36 --> 00:09:40
- It's a humdinger.- Too bad you can't tell me.

157
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
Somebody likes you!

158
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
- Is it Chandler?- No!

159
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
- Then tell him to stop staring.- It's Joey.

160
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
Really? Joey? You don't say.

161
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
- Would you be interested?- I don't know, I don't know.

162
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
You know, I mean, on the one hand,"Mother, may I?"

163
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
But, you know, on the other hand...

164
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
No. No, I can't. We're friends.

165
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
Oh, no. I don't wanna riskwhat we have.

166
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
I guess that makes sense.You think you're gonna talk to him?

167
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.I don't want him to get hurt.

168
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
Well, I must say, I am on fire!First Chandler, now Joey.

169
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
- Not Chandler. Just Joey.- Sure.

170
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
You know what?I'm coming around on the name Ruth.

171
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
I'd consider naming our child that.

172
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
Rach, I can't tell youhow much that means to me.

173
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

174
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
You hated the name Ruth.Why would you change your mind?

175
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
Unless you know we're nevergonna have to use it.

176
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
You did see. You know it's a boy!

177
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
I didn't see anything.I changed my mind.

178
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
I don't think so.You're giving me Ruth...

179
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
...so you get to name himwhen it's a boy.

180
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
That's when you'll swoop in andname him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.

181
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
I would... Sequoia!

182
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
- Veto.- Fine.

183
00:11:19 --> 00:11:24
Unless you anticipated thatI would figure all this out...

184
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
...and you know thatit actually is a girl.

185
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
And you really do want herto be named Ruth.

186
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35
Well, I'm not falling for that!Okay? Ruth is off the table!

187
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
- But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.- Not like this!

188
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
Hey. What's up?

189
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
- Joey, I know.- What?

190
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
- I know.- What?

191
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
- I know about your feelings.- Oh, my God, you do?

192
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
I'm sorry. Things worked out forChandler and Monica, but that's rare.

193
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
I know. And this is so much morecomplicated than it was for them.

194
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

195
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

196
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
I know! She's not only my friend,she's my pregnant friend.

197
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
She's my pregnant friendwho's Ross' ex!

198
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
Yeah, that's Rachel.Beat me over the head with it.

199
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
What am I gonna do? I keep tryingto get rid of these feelings.

200
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
I made a list of everythingI don't like about her.

201
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
- You wanna hear it?- Yeah.

202
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
"She made me switch to light mayo."That's it! That's all I got!

203
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
You know what? Tastes the sameand my pants fit better.

204
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
- Joey, this is probably just a crush.- You think?

205
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
Absolutely. You get this rushof feelings, but it goes away.

206
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
Yeah, just a crush.That's all this is. It's a crush!

207
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.

208
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
There you go.Crushes happen all the time.

209
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
I've had them for all you guys.Except for Ross and Chandler.

210
00:13:04 --> 00:13:08
- And I'm sure you've had them for us.- Not really.

211
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
Throw me a bone here.

212
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
So I called the doctor.

213
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
- Now we both know the sex of the baby.- What?

214
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
That's right.The student has become the master.

215
00:13:27 --> 00:13:32
- Ross, I swear. I don't know.- Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

216
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
- A what?- You really didn't know?

217
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
- We're having a girl?- No.

218
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
- That's what you said.- No.

219
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
- You said girl.- Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

220
00:13:42 --> 00:13:44
I'm not! We're having a girl!

221
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
Sometimes I can't believe it's withyou, but still, we're having a girl!

222
00:13:49 --> 00:13:53
I know! You know what?I'm putting Ruth back on the table.

223
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
Yes, we'll have ourselvesa little baby Ruth.

224
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
- Permission to veto.- Yes, please.

225
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
Do I smell essential oils?

226
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
I'm gonna take a bath.I was gonna get a magazine.

227
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
What do you think you're doing?

228
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
Leaving my troubles behind?

229
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
You're new at this,but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

230
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
It's so hard to carewhen you're this relaxed.

231
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
You can have the bath,but I am taking your boat.

232
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
Now you're just a girl in a tub.

233
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
Hi, bubbles. Manly.

234
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
I thought I'd let you knowhow it went.

235
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
- You told her?- She pulled it out of me!

236
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
She's like a conversational wizard!How did it go?

237
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
You were wrong. He doesn't like me.

238
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
How would you like it if I told youthat Lee Majors liked you...

239
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
...and you found outthat he didn't like you?

240
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
- I don't think I'd care.- Really? Lee Majors is hot.

241
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
- Hello?- We're in the bathroom!

242
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
- Why?- Because it's a relaxing time!

243
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
- What are you guys doing in here?- Oh, my God.

244
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
A friend he's looking at differently,but it's wrong.

245
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
- It's Rachel!- You like Rachel?

246
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
It's no big deal. Phoebe and I talked.It's a crush. It'll go away.

247
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
Dude, you gotta rearrangeyour bubbles.

248
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
Mazel tov.

249
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
Ross and I were looking for you.

250
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
What are we all doing in here?Oh, my.

251
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Honey, cover it up with the boat.

252
00:15:52 --> 00:15:53
Hello?

253
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
We're all in here,and we'd love for you to join us!

254
00:15:58 --> 00:16:03
Well, hey! What's going on?Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.

255
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
- Did you tell them?- I waited for you.

256
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
- Tell us what?- We're having a girl.

257
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
Oh, wow! Really?

258
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
I'll get you later.

259
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
And it's just a crush.

260
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
That's all. Just a little crush.

261
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
That was crazy.

262
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
Like my friend the bird here"would say", "It was cuckoo!"

263
00:16:36 --> 00:16:40
It's just a crush.

264
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
- I love you.

265
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
It's nice to do this together,isn't it?

266
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
Yeah. And what you're doingfeels so good.

267
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
- I'm not touching you.- You're not?

268
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
- It's the salts.- Sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.

269
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
Whatever keeps youoff the balcony, big guy.
