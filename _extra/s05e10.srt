1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
- What are you doing?- I reorganized the fridge.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
See? Bottom shelf,meats and dairy.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
And top shelf, expired products.

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:18
Why are you doing this?

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
Because I'm bored out of my mind.

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
I've already been to the bank,post office and dry cleaners.

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
Dude, you just describedseven days worth of stuff.

9
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
Spread it out a little.Haven't you ever been unemployed?

10
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
I'm not unemployed.I'm on sabbatical.

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
Hey, don't get religiouson me, okay?

12
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
A guy in your position needs to bebetter at relaxing.

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
That's why we have comfortable chairs.Here, sit down.

14
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
Ready? Watch.

15
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
And then...

16
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
- So, what? We just sit?- Oh, no, no.

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
We're not going to just sit.Watch.

18
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
- Hello, Chandler Bing.- Hello, Mr. Bing.

19
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
I love you!

20
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
stop calling me!

21
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
It's not funny!

22
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
But I love you!

23
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
For the love of God, leave me alone!

24
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
And that's Wednesday.

25
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
The One withThe Inappropriate Sister

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
Hey, you guys! Guess what?

27
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
The British are coming?

28
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
Oh, you and your ways.

29
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
Since it's Christmas,I'm going to be collecting donations.

30
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
I have my bell,and later on I get my bucket.

31
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
I'll be spreading joyto the people.

32
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
Last year I spread a little joy,but not enough.

33
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
So this year, I'm doingthe whole city.

34
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
I knew a girl in high school whodid that. She was very popular.

35
00:02:22 --> 00:02:25
So, Pheebs, where are youdoing your bell ringing?

36
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
They gave me a great spotright by Macy's.

37
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
They never give a good spotto a rookie...

38
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
...but I'm the only one who can say"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.

39
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
I lied!

40
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
Oh, my God. Here's Danny.

41
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
Just watch this.

42
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
See? Still pretendinghe's not interested.

43
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
He's coming over.Pretend we've forgotten who he is.

44
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
- Hey, guys.- Hey, Danny.

45
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
Oh, Danny! Hey!

46
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
You know Rachel. She's nice.She's not bad to look at, right?

47
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
Thanks, Mon.

48
00:02:59 --> 00:03:00
Of course.

49
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
Do you want to go outon a date with her?

50
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
Absolutely. Is Friday okay?

51
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
Friday is perfect.She can't wait.

52
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
On the date, I'll be ableto talk to her directly?

53
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
See you Friday.

54
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
Okay, what the hell was that?You know what? Don't answer me.

55
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
I have a date with Danny!

56
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
How could I not get the part?

57
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
The play was about a 29-year-oldItalian actor from Queens!

58
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
Well, Talia Shiresuddenly became available.

59
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
She's a woman!

60
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
What can I say? She nailed it!

61
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
Is there anything else?

62
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
You'll just say no again, but...

63
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
...gay porn?

64
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
Happy Holidays!

65
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
"Feliz Navidad"!

66
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
"Allo" and Merry Christmas!

67
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
Oh, thank you, sir!Here's some joy.

68
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
- How's it going?- It's going okay.

69
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Good. Let me help you out.

70
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
Oh, thanks!

71
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
Is that a new suede jacket?It looks really expensive.

72
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
Yeah. I guess.

73
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
Just get your nails done?

74
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
Yes, Phoebe, but thisis all I have, okay?

75
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
Thanks. Happy Holidays!Here's your joy.

76
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
Thank you! Happy Holidays and...Wait.

77
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
- You can't take money out.- I'm making change for the bus.

78
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
Can't you leave thedollar for the poor?

79
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
I'm poor.I got to take the bus.

80
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Okay. Seasons Greetings!But still...

81
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
Bite me, blondie!

82
00:04:31 --> 00:04:36
I'm going to give himsomething besides joy. Just...

83
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
I can't believeI didn't get that part.

84
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
I'm sorry, man.

85
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
What you should do...

86
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
...is make something happenfor yourself.

87
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
You know, like write a play.

88
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
Or a movie. What about those"Good Will Hunting" guys?

89
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
Be realistic, you know?If I did write something...

90
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
...what are the chances I couldget those guys to star in it?

91
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
Wait a second.I could star in it!

92
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Or that.

93
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
I can't write.I mean, I'm an actor.

94
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
I don't have the disciplinethat it takes. I can't do it.

95
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
I'll help you.

96
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
Yeah. I'll make up a scheduleand make sure you stick to it.

97
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
Plus it'll give mesomething to do.

98
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
You'd do that for me?Thanks.

99
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
We'll start slow. All you haveto come up with tonight...

100
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
...is the nameof your main character.

101
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
- Done.- And it can't be Joey.

102
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
- It's not.- Or Joseph.

103
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
Oh.

104
00:05:32 --> 00:05:33
What's up?

105
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
I just saw Danny on the subwaywith a girl...

106
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
...and he had his armaround her.

107
00:05:38 --> 00:05:39
Honey, I'm sorry.

108
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
You should be.This is all your fault.

109
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
You meddled in our relationship!

110
00:05:45 --> 00:05:46
You had no relationship!

111
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
But I was doing my thing,and everything...

112
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
...was going according to the plan!

113
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
Oh, God stop with the plan!

114
00:05:54 --> 00:05:55
So what if you saw himwith a girl?

115
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
That doesn't mean anything.

116
00:05:57 --> 00:06:01
You'll go out with Danny and beso charming he'll forget all about...

117
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
...that stupid subway girl.

118
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
She was kind of stupid.

119
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
You're right.I'm just going to go on the date.

120
00:06:08 --> 00:06:13
I'm just going to go on the date.That is the new plan.

121
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
Hurry!

122
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
- How do you spell "suspicious"?- Why?

123
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
I think this character is goingto be suspicious about stuff.

124
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
Chandler Bing, seven!Chandler Bing, zero!

125
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
You're driving me crazy.

126
00:06:40 --> 00:06:41
- I'll stop.- Don't stop.

127
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
Move the bowl further away.Ross could make that shot.

128
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
You suck. But at least you suckat a man's game now.

129
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
- Want to play?- I can't play games.

130
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
Ross'll be home soon. I have to write5 pages to stick to his schedule.

131
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
So play for 30 minutes,then write until he gets home.

132
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
All right.

133
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
But listen, what do you say we...

134
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
...crank it up a notch?

135
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
I'm intrigued.

136
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
All right. All we needis a little lighter fluid.

137
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
But be careful.I want our security deposit back.

138
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
We said goodbye to thatwhen we invented hammer darts.

139
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
Do you even remember which partof the wall is not spackle?

140
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
Thank you! Happy Holiday.

141
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
No, that's trash, young lady.You can't...

142
00:07:31 --> 00:07:35
Stop that young lady!She donated trash!

143
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
The charity's on fire!

144
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
Help!Thank you. I need that!

145
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
What is this?

146
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
It's nine o'clock in the morning!

147
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
All right. "A room."

148
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
"A man enters. He looks suspicious."

149
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
That's it?

150
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
You're supposed tohave five pages done by now...

151
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
...including an exciting incident.

152
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
What is all this?"The Official Rulebook of Fireball."

153
00:08:07 --> 00:08:08
That's the game we played.

154
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
It's great. You take atennis ball, a bowl and lighter...

155
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
This is helping your career?You wanted to be an actor.

156
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
Not the creator of"Crazy Lawsuit Game".

157
00:08:20 --> 00:08:21
You're right.I'll get back to work.

158
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
Shame on you! You should know better!Joey needs to work.

159
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
Now come on.

160
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
You can have thiswhen the 5 pages are done.

161
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
- I had a nice time tonight.- So did I.

162
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
I'm really glad Monica asked us out.

163
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
I'd love to ask you inbut my sister's visiting.

164
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
- I think she's asleep on the couch.- Your sister?

165
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
Your sister's asleep on the couch?

166
00:08:59 --> 00:09:04
I saw you with her on the subwayand now she's asleep on the couch!

167
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
- I thought I heard you.- Hey, great, you're up.

168
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
Rachel, my sister Krista.

169
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
Nice to meet you.

170
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
I wish you'd warned me.I'd have fixed myself up.

171
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
- Like it would help.- You are so bad.

172
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
- You are.- You are.

173
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
- You are.- You are!

174
00:09:18 --> 00:09:19
You are so dead!

175
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
I'm going to get you.Come here!

176
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
It's very nice to meet you.

177
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
Nobody!Nobody respects the bucket!

178
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
You wouldn't believewhat people put in here!

179
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
Does this look like agarbage can to you?

180
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
Does it look like an ashtray?

181
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
Does it look like a urinal?

182
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
- So you going back out there?- Yeah, but I won't take anymore crap.

183
00:09:49 --> 00:09:53
No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.

184
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
Good. You're tough.You lived on the street.

185
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
I'll go back to beingStreet Phoebe.

186
00:09:58 --> 00:10:03
But not totally back. Street Phoebewouldn't be friends with you guys.

187
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
Can I ask you guys something?

188
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
I don't have brothers so I don't know,but did you guys wrestle?

189
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
- Oh, yeah.- All the time.

190
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
In fact, I was undefeated.

191
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.

192
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
Still, I was quick as a cat.

193
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
I met Danny's sister yesterday.

194
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
- That was the girl on the subway.- You're kidding.

195
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
They were very, you know...

196
00:10:29 --> 00:10:30
...wrestle-y.

197
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
But I guess that's normal?

198
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
We don't wrestle now.

199
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
Not since I got toostrong for you.

200
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
Too strong for me?

201
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
You want to go right now?

202
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
I'll take you right now, buddy!You want to go?

203
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
Oh, fine.

204
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
Ready?

205
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Wrestle!

206
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
Okay, you know what?

207
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
Actually, that helps a lot.Thanks.

208
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
Let's go!The puck drops in 20 minutes!

209
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
Joey's not going.

210
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
I didn't finish my 5 pages.

211
00:11:09 --> 00:11:10
Finish them tomorrow.

212
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Tomorrow he's redoingyesterday's pages.

213
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
Yesterday's pagesdid not reflect my best work.

214
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
Cut him some slack. If he relaxes,he'll get some work done.

215
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22
I think he's been relaxing enough,thanks to you...

216
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
...and Fireball.

217
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
If you think Fireball's relaxing,you've never played.

218
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
You're doing thisbecause you're bored.

219
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
It's not his faultyou're unemployed.

220
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
I am not unemployed.I'm on sabbatical!

221
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
Guys, don't fight.

222
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
And I'm doing this becauseI am Joey's friend.

223
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
If you were a friend,you'd be doing the same.

224
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
So being a friend meansbeing a jerk?

225
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
If it does, then you'rean amazing friend of mine.

226
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
Let's settle thisover a game of Fireball.

227
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
- I'll unhook the smoke detectors.- Let's settle this right now.

228
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
There. Now no one's goingto the game.

229
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
- I paid for those!- You said you would, but you didn't.

230
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
Oh, yeah.

231
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
We finally getto the top of the mountain...

232
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
...and airhead hereforgets the camera.

233
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
The same thinghappened to me one time.

234
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
When did that happen to you?

235
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
Remember? We were joggingand saw that bird.

236
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
I wanted to take a picturebut I didn't have my camera.

237
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
Chasing the churroguy is not jogging.

238
00:12:26 --> 00:12:30
Oh, this is so good.You have got to try it.

239
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
- Damn. I got it on my pants.- Here, I'll get it.

240
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
We better take them offor the stain will set.

241
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
- I want to wear them tonight.- Oh, great.

242
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
Okay, bye. Oh, my God!

243
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
- That was unbelievable.- See? I told you.

244
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
Yeah, wow. Sorry.

245
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
I don't believe they'rebrother and sister.

246
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
They're brother and sister?!

247
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
Wait a minute. Open your hand.Let me take a look.

248
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
Quarter, dime. Lint?Not interested in that.

249
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
What's this?A Canadian coin?

250
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Get out of here!

251
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
Whoa!No drinks near the bucket.

252
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
Set it down there and thenyou can make a contribution.

253
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
You can leave the "hurt bunny"look over there too.

254
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
Hi, Bob.

255
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
I thought I told youto get out of here!

256
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
Phoebe, we've beengetting complaints.

257
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
We're moving you to aless high-profile spot.

258
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
- Ginger's taking this corner.- That chick can't handle my corner.

259
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
Look, either you leaveor we remove you.

260
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
Fine.

261
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
I'll give you one pointer.Look out for that bitch.

262
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
- I thought we said seven.- You know what? Let's skip it.

263
00:14:12 --> 00:14:13
What? Why?

264
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
You and your sister seem to havea very special bond...

265
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
Oh, great.That "special bond" again.

266
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
Why do women have a problemwith my being close to my sister?

267
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
- I don't know, but...- Do you have brothers?

268
00:14:27 --> 00:14:32
No, I have two sisters. But onehas a very masculine energy.

269
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
- Are you close?- No. They're not very nice people.

270
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
I like you.I think this could go somewhere.

271
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
So I'm close to my family.Don't let it stand in our way.

272
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
Well, I don't know...

273
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
When you put it that way...

274
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
Danny? Hurry up.The bath's getting cold.

275
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
I'll see you later.

276
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
There's some kidsplaying in the street.

277
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
Want to go give them a project,ruin their day?

278
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
If they have a ball,you could stick razors in it...

279
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
...and teach them a new game:"Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."

280
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
Hey, guys! I was at the library.I already finished my 5 pages.

281
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
Now we can goto the Ranger game... last night!

282
00:15:18 --> 00:15:22
No, dude.Ross tore up the tickets.

283
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
I guess without so many distractionsit's easier for you to focus, huh?

284
00:15:28 --> 00:15:33
Also without somebody breathingdown your neck all the livelong day!

285
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
The important thing is I finished it.And I think it's really good.

286
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
But it would help if I could hear it.Would you guys read it for me?

287
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
- Yeah, all right.- All right.

288
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
"It's a typical New York apartment."

289
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
"Two guys are hanging out."

290
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
"Hey, man."

291
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
"What is up?"

292
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
"About yesterday.I was really wrong. I am sorry."

293
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
"No, it was me. I'm sorry.I overreacted."

294
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
"Maybe it was both of us.But we had our best friend's inter...

295
00:16:08 --> 00:16:12
But we had our best friend'sinterest at heart."

296
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
"Could I be more sorry?"

297
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
"I don't know. I am one sorry...

298
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
...polontologist."

299
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
All right, Joey, we get it.

300
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
- I'm sorry.- I'm sorry too.

301
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
Keep reading.The good part's coming up.

302
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
"I am sorry, Chandler."

303
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
"I am sorry, Ross."

304
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
"A handsome man enters."

305
00:16:45 --> 00:16:49
"I don't know what you're talkingabout, but I'd like to thank you both."

306
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
"You. You wouldn't let megive up on myself."

307
00:16:52 --> 00:16:53
"And you."

308
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
"You co-created Fireball."

309
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
"The End."

310
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
This took you all day?

311
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
No, this took five minutes.

312
00:17:03 --> 00:17:08
I spent the rest of the day coming upwith New Ultimate Fireball!

313
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
"It's a typicalNew York apartment."

314
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
"Two girls are justhanging out. " Go.

315
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
- "Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?"- "I'm doing just fine."

316
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
"God, Tiffany, you smell so great."

317
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
"It's my new perfume."

318
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
"Why don't you come closer whereyou can really appreciate it."

319
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
- Joey, you are sick.- This is disgusting.

320
00:17:33 --> 00:17:34
I'm not reading this.

321
00:17:34 --> 00:17:39
Wait, wait, wait!The handsome man was about to enter!
