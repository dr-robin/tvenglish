00:00:05.18,00:00:08.06

17

How much you give me to eat[br]this whole jar of olives?

18



19

00:00:08.42,00:00:11.54

20

I won't give you anything,[br]but you'll owe me $2.95.

21



22

00:00:12.42,00:00:13.25

23

Done.

24



25

00:00:15.22,00:00:17.26

26

I need an atlas![br]I need an atlas!

27



28

00:00:17.46,00:00:19.42

29

Why? Do you have a report due?

30



31

00:00:20.74,00:00:22.70

32

I have a date[br]with diplomat I met. . .

33



34

00:00:22.90,00:00:25.26

35

. . .while I was giving free massages[br]outside the U.N.

36



37

00:00:26.10,00:00:28.25

38

And I don't know where his country is.

39



40

00:00:28.58,00:00:30.86

41

Let's start with[br]the free massages at the U.N.

42



43

00:00:31.10,00:00:34.70

44

It's my new thing. I figure,[br]"Bodies at peace make peace. "

45



46

00:00:36.54,00:00:39.46

47

You might just get[br]the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.

48



49

00:00:40.06,00:00:41.62

50

So what country is this guy from?

51



52

00:00:46.02,00:00:47.22

53

There's a "g" in there.

54



55

00:00:48.86,00:00:49.66

56

Where's that?

57



58

00:00:49.90,00:00:51.26

59

In your atlas!

60



61

00:00:52.06,00:00:53.26

62

I don't have an atlas.

63



64

00:00:53.46,00:00:56.10

65

But wait, I do have a globe.[br]Hold on.

66



67

00:00:56.34,00:00:57.62

68

So what's this guy like?

69



70

00:00:58.70,00:01:00.50

71

Well, he's very. . .

72



73

00:01:00.74,00:01:02.06

74

. . .dashing, you know?

75



76

00:01:02.30,00:01:03.90

77

And very, very sophisticated.

78



79

00:01:04.10,00:01:05.70

80

And he doesn't speak English. . .

81



82

00:01:05.90,00:01:08.10

83

. . .but his translator says[br]he totally gets me.

84



85

00:01:09.74,00:01:10.86

86

Okay, here you go.

87



88

00:01:11.30,00:01:12.66

89

What is this?

90



91

00:01:14.34,00:01:15.66

92

It's a globe.

93



94

00:01:16.90,00:01:18.26

95

And a pencil sharpener.

96



97

00:01:20.38,00:01:22.98

98

Need anything copied?[br]I'm going to the Xerox place.

99



100

00:01:23.18,00:01:24.06

101

No, thanks.

102



103

00:01:24.30,00:01:26.37

104

Just give me anything[br]I can make two of.

105



106

00:01:28.02,00:01:30.09

107

If you have nothing to copy,[br]why go there?

108



109

00:01:30.34,00:01:32.22

110

Are you just gonna gawk[br]at that girl. . .

111



112

00:01:32.42,00:01:34.49

113

. . .with the bellybutton ring again?

114



115

00:01:34.82,00:01:36.02

116

You wanna come?

125

Come on, Chloe. Finish with[br]your customer first.

126



127

00:02:31.42,00:02:34.14

128

Come on, Chloe.[br]Come on, Chloe!

129



130

00:02:34.62,00:02:35.45

131

Can I help you?

132



133

00:02:37.86,00:02:41.70

134

We're having second thoughts[br]about our copying needs.

135



136

00:02:41.94,00:02:44.46

137

And we'll need more time[br]to think about it.

138



139

00:02:45.50,00:02:48.78

140

Chloe, switch with me. Some guys[br]have a crush on you.

141



142

00:02:50.34,00:02:52.06

143

Okay, that hurt us.

144



145

00:02:52.90,00:02:55.46

146

Hi, guys. I haven't seen you[br]since this morning.

147



148

00:02:56.54,00:02:57.34

149

Well. . .

150



151

00:03:00.06,00:03:01.05

152

. . .you know.

153



154

00:03:02.70,00:03:04.22

155

What are you doing tomorrow?

156



157

00:03:05.30,00:03:06.34

158

Both of us?

159



160

00:03:06.98,00:03:09.10

161

Maybe. Does that scare you?

162



163

00:03:13.90,00:03:16.50

164

Relax. Isaac's deejaying[br]at The Philly.

165



166

00:03:16.74,00:03:18.65

167

-You should come.[br]-We'll be there.

168



169

00:03:18.86,00:03:21.06

170

Great. I'll see you then.

171



172

00:03:21.30,00:03:22.86

173

All right! Rock on.

174



175

00:03:35.34,00:03:40.26

176

He says that walking with you makes[br]this strange city feel like home.

177



178

00:03:41.34,00:03:43.90

179

Me too. Although this city[br]is my home.

180



181

00:03:44.14,00:03:47.26

182

So that's dumb, what I said.[br]Don't tell him I said that.

183



184

00:03:48.06,00:03:49.66

185

You make something up.

186



187

00:03:59.10,00:04:00.46

188

Nice! Thank you.

189



190

00:04:01.74,00:04:03.46

191

This is me, here.

192



193

00:04:12.94,00:04:15.30

194

Your eyes are very pretty.

195



196

00:04:16.34,00:04:18.65

197

Thank you very much.

198



199

00:04:18.90,00:04:19.70

200

Oh, thank you.

201



202

00:04:28.90,00:04:30.54

203

He would like to kiss you.

204



205

00:04:34.46,00:04:36.45

206

You don't have to do that now.

207



208

00:04:37.02,00:04:38.74

209

No, no, not him![br]No, you don't.

210



211

00:04:43.70,00:04:45.26

212

The moment's over.

213



214

00:05:00.06,00:05:01.46

215

There it is, right there.

216



217

00:05:01.66,00:05:03.10

218

It's small.

219



220

00:05:03.94,00:05:06.66

221

Yeah, but Sergei said[br]it took the Germans six weeks. . .

222



223

00:05:06.86,00:05:09.06

224

. . .to get all the way across it.

225



226

00:05:09.74,00:05:10.78

227

So you had fun?

228



229

00:05:11.86,00:05:14.06

230

Except for, you know,[br]when you're on a date. . .

231



232

00:05:14.26,00:05:16.02

233

. . .and you're getting along great. . .

234



235

00:05:16.22,00:05:18.86

236

. . .but the guy's translator[br]keeps getting in the way?

237



238

00:05:23.46,00:05:25.10

239

Is Rach in her room?

240



241

00:05:25.34,00:05:27.65

242

She's still at work,[br]but she said to call her.

243



244

00:05:27.90,00:05:30.90

245

Is she gonna cancel on me again?[br]How could she do this?

246



247

00:05:31.14,00:05:32.66

248

What about our anniversary?

249



250

00:05:32.90,00:05:36.45

251

This is the extent of my knowledge[br]on the subject.

252



253

00:05:36.74,00:05:37.73

254

"Call Rachel. "

255



256

00:05:38.90,00:05:40.13

257

What's that on the bottom?

258



259

00:05:40.34,00:05:44.05

260

That's my doodle of[br]a ladybug with a top hat.

261



262

00:05:44.46,00:05:45.26

263

She's fancy.

264



265

00:05:50.34,00:05:51.54

266

-Hey, honey.[br]-Oh, hi.

267



268

00:05:51.74,00:05:52.94

269

What's going on?

270



271

00:05:53.18,00:05:56.18

272

Shipping had a disaster.[br]I've gotta get this order in.

273



274

00:05:56.42,00:05:59.62

275

I'm so sorry, but it looks like[br]I'll be here all night.

276



277

00:06:00.14,00:06:02.45

278

What? Well, how about[br]I come up there?

279



280

00:06:02.70,00:06:06.33

281

No, honey, please.[br]I just have too much to deal with.

282



283

00:06:06.54,00:06:09.77

284

Anyway, I'm going out[br]with Sergei again tonight, and. . . .

285



286

00:06:09.98,00:06:11.66

287

Could you be the translator's date. . .

288



289

00:06:11.90,00:06:13.66

290

. . .so that when we want to be alone. . .

291



292

00:06:13.90,00:06:15.86

293

. . .you two can split off?

294



295

00:06:17.18,00:06:18.90

296

You know, he's kind of cute.

297



298

00:06:19.10,00:06:20.78

299

Like, "really kind of cute"?

300



301

00:06:21.02,00:06:24.06

302

Or "kind of cute" Iike your friend[br]Spackle-Back Larry?

303



304

00:06:24.30,00:06:25.86

305

Don't call him that.

306



307

00:06:26.10,00:06:28.46

308

His name is Spackle-Back Harry.

309



310

00:06:32.66,00:06:33.98

311

Maybe we should get going.

312



313

00:06:34.22,00:06:35.90

314

What time did Chloe say[br]to get there?

315



316

00:06:36.14,00:06:38.18

317

-1 0:30.[br]-What time is it now?

318



319

00:06:38.82,00:06:40.05

320

4:30.

321



322

00:06:41.06,00:06:42.10

323

So we'll hang out.

324



325

00:06:47.50,00:06:50.50

326

Remember when she brought up[br]that thing about the three of us?

327



328

00:06:50.74,00:06:52.70

329

Yes, vividly.

330



331

00:06:53.54,00:06:56.66

332

-She was kidding about that, right?[br]-Yeah, I think so.

333



334

00:07:01.50,00:07:03.10

335

Yeah, I think so.

336



337

00:07:03.90,00:07:07.66

338

God, it'd be weird if that situation[br]presented itself tonight.

339



340

00:07:08.90,00:07:10.46

341

Yeah, I mean. . .

342



343

00:07:11.30,00:07:13.06

344

. . .what would we do?

345



346

00:07:15.66,00:07:17.26

347

Dude, I don't know.

348



349

00:07:18.74,00:07:19.78

350

She was kidding.

351



352

00:07:20.02,00:07:21.25

353

She was. . . .

354



355

00:07:21.90,00:07:24.50

356

Just in case, we should have[br]some ground rules.

357



358

00:07:24.70,00:07:26.10

359

Yeah. For sure.

360



361

00:07:26.74,00:07:30.34

362

You probably want the first one to be,[br]"Never open your eyes. "

363



364

00:07:31.90,00:07:35.05

365

Because you don't[br]want to be doing something. . .

366



367

00:07:35.26,00:07:37.98

368

. . .and then look up, right?

369



370

00:07:38.22,00:07:41.37

371

And see something that[br]you don't want to be seeing.

372



373

00:07:42.06,00:07:43.05

374

Good call. Nice.

375



376

00:07:43.30,00:07:45.06

377

Hold it! Hold it!

378



379

00:07:46.50,00:07:49.06

380

What if my eyes are closed, and. . .

381



382

00:07:50.30,00:07:52.13

383

. . .and my hand is out there. . . .

384



385

00:07:53.82,00:07:55.97

386

Okay, eyes open at all times!

387



388

00:08:00.02,00:08:02.86

389

How do we decide where we. . .

390



391

00:08:03.82,00:08:04.97

392

. . .you know, each would. . .

393



394

00:08:05.22,00:08:06.26

395

. . .you know. . .

396



397

00:08:07.30,00:08:08.10

398

. . .be?

399



400

00:08:08.30,00:08:11.45

401

Right. Well, you know,[br]we could flip for it.

402



403

00:08:11.70,00:08:14.58

404

I guess. But like,[br]what's heads and what's tails?

405



406

00:08:16.90,00:08:20.26

407

If you don't know that,[br]I don't want to do this with you.

408



409

00:08:23.34,00:08:26.49

410

No, no. I am looking[br]at a purchase order here. . .

411



412

00:08:26.74,00:08:29.10

413

. . .that shows we[br]ordered the Riviera bikini. . .

414



415

00:08:29.34,00:08:32.34

416

. . .in a variety of sizes and colors--

417



418

00:08:33.74,00:08:36.05

419

What does it matter what I'm wearing?

420



421

00:08:36.62,00:08:39.70

422

Could I speak to your supervisor?[br]Thank you.

423



424

00:08:39.94,00:08:41.09

425

Hi.

426



427

00:08:41.34,00:08:42.70

428

My God![br]What are you doing here?

429



430

00:08:42.94,00:08:45.58

431

Well, you said[br]you couldn't go out, so. . . .

432



433

00:08:45.82,00:08:48.90

434

You brought a picnic![br]What a boyfriend.

435



436

00:08:49.10,00:08:52.06

437

That's it. On Monday, I start[br]wearing makeup.

438



439

00:08:53.02,00:08:55.90

440

Honey, this is very nice,[br]but I've got a crisis.

441



442

00:08:56.10,00:08:57.50

443

But I've got couscous!

444



445

00:08:59.02,00:09:01.33

446

Honey,[br]I know it's our anniversary. . .

447



448

00:09:01.54,00:09:04.85

449

. . .but I told you on the phone,[br]I don't have time to stop.

450



451

00:09:05.10,00:09:08.41

452

You don't have to stop.[br]I'm invisible. I'm not here.

453



454

00:09:08.62,00:09:10.18

455

Yeah, but I don't--

456



457

00:09:10.38,00:09:12.69

458

Who approved that order?

459



460

00:09:12.90,00:09:15.90

461

Well, there is no Mark Robinson[br]in this office.

462



463

00:09:16.30,00:09:19.26

464

-Get Mark on the phone![br]-I love Mark. Do you know him?

465



466

00:09:21.06,00:09:23.13

467

Let me check that[br]with what I've got.

468



469

00:09:23.34,00:09:26.70

470

See, 038 is not the number[br]for this store. 038 is Atlanta.

471



472

00:09:31.94,00:09:32.74

473

Pepper?

474



475

00:09:34.82,00:09:35.78

476

None for me.

477



478

00:09:36.02,00:09:37.09

479

Okay, sorry!

480



481

00:09:38.54,00:09:41.46

482

Sorry. As I was saying,[br]the store number is wrong.

483



484

00:09:41.66,00:09:42.86

485

And I'm sorry, but--

486



487

00:09:43.06,00:09:44.18

488

Oh, my God!

489



490

00:09:51.58,00:09:55.02

491

I have to call you back.[br]I've got Shemp in my office.

492



493

00:09:58.14,00:10:00.10

494

-What are you doing?[br]-I'm sorry.

495



496

00:10:00.30,00:10:03.66

497

But somebody's off the phone![br]How about a glass of wine. . .

498



499

00:10:03.90,00:10:06.66

500

. . .by the fire?[br]I can get it going again. . . .

501



502

00:10:07.34,00:10:10.18

503

You're not listening.[br]I don't have time to stop.

504



505

00:10:10.38,00:10:13.14

506

-You don't have 1 0 minutes?[br]-I don't have 1 0 minutes!

507



508

00:10:13.38,00:10:16.85

509

-Sophie, does she have 1 0 minutes?[br]-I told you, I don't!

510



511

00:10:17.10,00:10:20.30

512

Don't yell. This is[br]the most I've seen you all week.

513



514

00:10:20.54,00:10:24.50

515

Look, I cannot do this right now.[br]I've got a deadline!

516



517

00:10:24.74,00:10:26.50

518

Go home and we'll talk later.

519



520

00:10:26.74,00:10:28.50

521

-Yeah, but wait--![br]-Goodbye!

522



523

00:10:35.62,00:10:38.22

524

Actually, that's our three-hole punch.

525



526

00:10:44.94,00:10:45.90

527

Hi.

528



529

00:10:46.50,00:10:48.70

530

Look, about what happened earlier--

531



532

00:10:48.94,00:10:52.33

533

I completely understand.[br]You were stressed.

534



535

00:10:55.66,00:10:58.58

536

I was gonna give you a chance[br]to apologize to me.

537



538

00:10:59.10,00:11:01.66

539

For letting you throw me[br]out of your office?

540



541

00:11:01.90,00:11:04.78

542

You had no right[br]coming down to my office.

543



544

00:11:05.02,00:11:08.46

545

You do not bring a picnic basket[br]to somebody's work. . .

546



547

00:11:08.66,00:11:10.62

548

. . .unless they're a park ranger!

549



550

00:11:13.06,00:11:16.45

551

Excuse me for wanting to be with[br]my girl on our anniversary.

552



553

00:11:16.70,00:11:18.06

554

Boy, what an ass am l!

555



556

00:11:19.42,00:11:22.06

557

But I told you[br]I didn't have the time!

558



559

00:11:22.30,00:11:23.98

560

Well, you never have the time.

561



562

00:11:24.18,00:11:26.49

563

I don't feel like I have[br]a girlfriend anymore.

564



565

00:11:26.70,00:11:28.46

566

Do you want me to quit my job. . .

567



568

00:11:28.70,00:11:31.09

569

. . .so you can feel like[br]you have a girlfriend?

570



571

00:11:31.34,00:11:34.81

572

It would nice if you'd realize[br]that it's just a job.

573



574

00:11:35.34,00:11:37.90

575

Just a job?

576



577

00:11:39.42,00:11:43.10

578

It's the first time in my life[br]I'm doing something I care about!

579



580

00:11:43.34,00:11:46.38

581

The first time[br]I'm doing something I'm good at!

582



583

00:11:46.62,00:11:47.98

584

If you don't get that--

585



586

00:11:48.18,00:11:50.33

587

I get that, and I'm happy for you.

588



589

00:11:50.54,00:11:54.58

590

But I'm tired of dating your answering[br]machine! I don't know what to do!

591



592

00:11:54.78,00:11:56.42

593

Well, neither do l!

594



595

00:11:58.34,00:11:59.46

596

Is this about Mark?

597



598

00:12:01.10,00:12:02.06

599

Oh, my God!

600



601

00:12:02.30,00:12:03.10

602

Okay, it's not.

603



604

00:12:03.30,00:12:04.58

605

Oh, my God!

606



607

00:12:04.82,00:12:08.90

608

I cannot keep having this same fight[br]over and over again.

609



610

00:12:09.10,00:12:10.66

611

You're making this too hard.

612



613

00:12:10.90,00:12:12.94

614

I'm making this too hard?[br]What should I do?

615



616

00:12:13.14,00:12:15.29

617

I don't know![br]I don't know! Look. . .

618



619

00:12:15.54,00:12:17.66

620

. . .maybe we should just take a break!

621



622

00:12:18.10,00:12:21.30

623

Fine, you're right.[br]Let's take a break. Let's cool off.

624



625

00:12:21.54,00:12:24.26

626

Let's get some frozen yogurt[br]or something.

627



628

00:12:30.10,00:12:31.86

629

A break from us.

630



631

00:12:45.22,00:12:47.66

632

--advances in collating[br]in the past five years.

633



634

00:12:48.26,00:12:50.25

635

We just got in an X-5000, you know?

636



637

00:12:50.46,00:12:53.22

638

The X-5000 makes an X-50[br]look like a T-71 .

639



640

00:12:57.06,00:12:58.46

641

It's the dinosaur guy!

642



643

00:12:59.86,00:13:01.30

644

-Hi, Ross![br]-Hi, Chloe.

645



646

00:13:01.54,00:13:04.06

647

I want you to meet[br]some friends of mine.

648



649

00:13:06.10,00:13:09.65

650

He's my hero. He'll want[br]to blow stuff up 400 percent.

651



652

00:13:09.90,00:13:14.06

653

We say we don't do that. He says,[br]"You gotta. " Know what? We did it.

654



655

00:13:14.38,00:13:17.98

656

Now anytime anybody wants 400,[br]we just say, "Let's Ross it! "

657



658

00:13:18.26,00:13:20.82

659

And that's the only color[br]that comes in.

660



661

00:13:22.02,00:13:25.30

662

Yo, Chloe! Do you have a quarter[br]for the condom machine?

663



664

00:13:28.90,00:13:32.13

665

What are you doing? I thought[br]tonight's your anniversary dinner.

666



667

00:13:32.34,00:13:34.06

668

A little change of plans.

669



670

00:13:34.26,00:13:36.25

671

We're gonna break up instead.

672



673

00:13:39.10,00:13:41.06

674

And I can speak a little French.

675



676

00:13:45.74,00:13:47.30

677

Why? What did I say?

678



679

00:13:47.54,00:13:50.98

680

Well, you just asked if I wanted[br]to go to bed with you tonight.

681



682

00:13:53.06,00:13:54.26

683

Oh, my God!

684



685

00:13:54.46,00:13:57.66

686

No wonder I get such great service[br]at Café Maurice.

687



688

00:13:58.42,00:13:59.70

689

Knock, knock, knock.

690



691

00:13:59.94,00:14:04.26

692

Hi. Could you please tell Sergei[br]that I was fascinated. . .

693



694

00:14:04.46,00:14:07.54

695

. . .by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali said[br]in the Times?

696



697

00:14:11.02,00:14:13.58

698

You didn't say[br]"Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "

699



700

00:14:13.82,00:14:15.81

701

Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

702



703

00:14:17.82,00:14:19.18

704

He says he was too.

705



706

00:14:19.38,00:14:20.53

707

Interesting.

708



709

00:14:22.54,00:14:24.50

710

So I was wondering--

711



712

00:14:24.70,00:14:26.85

713

Before you get all talky again. . .

714



715

00:14:27.54,00:14:30.01

716

. . .could you also please[br]tell Sergei. . .

717



718

00:14:31.42,00:14:33.65

719

. . .that I really like his suit.

720



721

00:14:46.30,00:14:48.74

722

He said, "Thank you.[br]You look pretty tonight.

723



724

00:14:49.14,00:14:51.90

725

Your hair, golden like the sun. "[br]So you're a chef?

726



727

00:14:53.38,00:14:55.85

728

I'm also thinking of opening up[br]my own restaurant.

729



730

00:14:56.10,00:14:57.06

731

Really?

732



733

00:14:57.26,00:14:59.30

734

Could I talk to you[br]behind my menu?

735



736

00:15:02.02,00:15:02.98

737

What are you doing?

738



739

00:15:03.54,00:15:05.42

740

Well, I was having a conversation.

741



742

00:15:05.62,00:15:10.06

743

Misha's so interested in you, Sergei[br]and I haven't been able to talk at all.

744



745

00:15:10.94,00:15:13.66

746

You want me to sit silently,[br]while you three converse?

747



748

00:15:13.90,00:15:15.46

749

That would be great.[br]Thank you.

750



751

00:15:23.50,00:15:25.46

752

Hi. It's Mark.

753



754

00:15:27.02,00:15:29.25

755

What? ls it my breath?

756



757

00:15:29.94,00:15:32.50

758

Sorry. I just thought[br]you were somebody else.

759



760

00:15:32.70,00:15:37.22

761

I was just gonna leave a message.[br]Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner?

762



763

00:15:40.26,00:15:41.90

764

Rach? Are you okay?

765



766

00:15:42.10,00:15:43.93

767

Yeah, I'm fine.

768



769

00:15:44.86,00:15:46.69

770

You wanna talk?[br]I can come over.

771



772

00:15:46.94,00:15:49.25

773

Really, no. Please.[br]That's okay.

774



775

00:15:49.50,00:15:51.70

776

All right. I'm coming over[br]with Chinese food.

777



778

00:15:51.90,00:15:53.30

779

I'm not hungry.

780



781

00:15:53.54,00:15:54.86

782

It's for me.

783



784

00:15:56.62,00:15:57.66

785

Bye.

786



787

00:16:01.70,00:16:03.38

788

-So what'll you do?[br]-What can I do?

789



790

00:16:03.62,00:16:05.85

791

One person wants to break up,[br]you break up.

792



793

00:16:06.06,00:16:09.29

794

No way. This is you guys.[br]Call her and work it out.

795



796

00:16:09.54,00:16:12.77

797

We just had this huge fight.[br]Don't I have to wait awhile?

798



799

00:16:13.02,00:16:17.06

800

It isn't like swimming after you eat.[br]Pick up the phone!

801



802

00:16:21.54,00:16:23.85

803

You know that[br]swimming thing is a myth.

804



805

00:16:24.06,00:16:25.86

806

Tell that to my Uncle Lenny.

807



808

00:16:26.34,00:16:28.06

809

Why? What happened to him?

810



811

00:16:28.70,00:16:31.46

812

Nothing. He just really[br]believes in that.

813



814

00:16:33.30,00:16:36.26

815

Then we got into this big fight--[br]It was awful.

816



817

00:16:36.46,00:16:41.33

818

I told him he treats me like[br]a park ranger, something. . . .

819



820

00:16:41.86,00:16:43.01

821

And then. . .

822



823

00:16:44.14,00:16:46.45

824

. . .I told him[br]I wanted to take a break.

825



826

00:16:46.70,00:16:49.06

827

I don't want to take a break.

828



829

00:16:49.50,00:16:50.86

830

I'm sorry.

831



832

00:16:52.06,00:16:53.05

833

Egg roll?

834



835

00:16:55.74,00:16:58.62

836

And then I called him and[br]he wasn't there.

837



838

00:16:58.82,00:17:00.34

839

He's probably just out.

840



841

00:17:00.54,00:17:03.46

842

Thank you, that's very helpful.[br]I'm glad you came over.

843



844

00:17:09.34,00:17:10.30

845

Hi, it's me.

846



847

00:17:10.82,00:17:12.89

848

Oh, I'm so glad you called.

849



850

00:17:13.14,00:17:13.97

851

Really?

852



853

00:17:14.22,00:17:17.42

854

This is crazy. Don't you think[br]we can work on this?

855



856

00:17:18.34,00:17:19.98

857

What do you want to drink?

858



859

00:17:20.42,00:17:21.22

860

Who's that?

862

00:17:22.82,00:17:23.86

863

Nobody?

864



865

00:17:24.86,00:17:27.30

866

Is it okay if I finish[br]the apple juice?

867



868

00:17:27.94,00:17:28.93

869

Is that Mark?

870



871

00:17:30.14,00:17:31.74

872

Honey, he just came over--

873



874

00:17:31.94,00:17:33.30

875

Yeah, got it!

876



877

00:17:38.54,00:17:41.10

878

Hey, Dinosaur Guy![br]Look at you, so sad.

879



880

00:17:41.34,00:17:42.14

881

Come dance.

882



883

00:17:42.34,00:17:43.86

884

That's okay. Thanks.

885



886

00:17:45.94,00:17:48.58

887

You don't have to smile.[br]You just have to dance.

888



889

00:17:48.78,00:17:52.30

890

I don't feel like dancing.[br]I feel like having a drink, okay?

891



892

00:17:52.54,00:17:54.26

893

Two beers!

894



895

00:17:56.02,00:17:58.09

896

And the vet said it was time.

897



898

00:17:58.34,00:18:00.25

899

And so from half a world away. . .

900



901

00:18:00.46,00:18:03.06

902

. . .while my mother[br]held the phone to his ear. . .

903



904

00:18:03.30,00:18:06.26

905

. . .I said goodbye to my dog. . .

906



907

00:18:06.74,00:18:08.50

908

. . .in seven languages.

909



910

00:18:10.54,00:18:12.45

911

-Could I have a tissue?[br]-Oh, sure.

912



913

00:18:12.66,00:18:14.81

914

I just hope you don't accidentally. . .

915



916

00:18:15.02,00:18:17.46

917

. . .suck it up through your nose[br]and choke on it.

918



919

00:18:23.10,00:18:26.78

920

Sergei would like to apologize[br]for my behavior tonight.

921



922

00:18:28.06,00:18:30.34

923

Well, tell him, "Apology accepted. "

924



925

00:18:33.14,00:18:37.26

926

Unbelievable. For the first time in[br]years, someone wants to talk to me.

927



928

00:18:37.46,00:18:40.66

929

But do you think he would[br]let me enjoy that? No!

930



931

00:18:41.54,00:18:44.85

932

You silly diplomat.[br]Why don't you learn some English?

933



934

00:18:46.94,00:18:50.30

935

Excuse me, but isn't he paying[br]for your dinner?

936



937

00:18:50.50,00:18:52.38

938

The man's dog just died.

939



940

00:19:09.74,00:19:11.70

941

I have just resigned my post.

942



943

00:19:11.90,00:19:14.21

944

Will you accompany me[br]to the Rainbow Room?

945



946

00:19:14.42,00:19:16.10

947

I have diplomatic coupons.

948



949

00:19:18.74,00:19:20.65

950

It would be my pleasure.

951



952

00:19:21.34,00:19:23.41

953

My guy has coupons.

954



955

00:19:25.06,00:19:27.66

956

Your guy can't even say "coupons. "

957



958

00:19:34.74,00:19:35.54

959

Plate.

960



961

00:19:35.94,00:19:37.70

962

Plate! Yes! Plate!

963



964

00:19:41.54,00:19:43.26

965

See, we don't need them.

966



967

00:19:57.50,00:19:58.86

968

I like this song.

969



970

00:20:00.14,00:20:02.45

971

Well, you're practically[br]dancing, already.

972



973

00:20:03.62,00:20:05.85

974

Why don't you just do it over here?

975



976

00:20:06.74,00:20:08.10

977

What are you, married?

978



979

00:20:09.10,00:20:10.46

980

Because that's okay.

981



982

00:20:25.14,00:20:27.86

983

Oh, be home, be home, be home. . . .

984



985

00:20:34.06,00:20:35.46

986

You're not home.

987



988

00:20:46.14,00:20:47.21

989

Still no smile?

990



991

00:21:21.26,00:21:23.65

992

--Miss American Pie

993



994

00:21:24.30,00:21:25.53

995

Ameri-can.

996



997

00:21:28.54,00:21:30.50

998

It's a very hard language.

999



1000

00:21:31.34,00:21:32.54

1001

Let's do it again.
