00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
All right!

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
Yes! From home to the hospitalin seven minutes!

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
Yes. The hard part is truly over.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
We're off to a great start, aren't we?

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
I knew I'd get here fast,but this has to be a record!

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
- Oh, you made it!- Hi.

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
- How the hell did you beat us here?- We took a cab. Did you walk?

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
No, we took a cab too.But I did test runs...

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
Hey, you made it!

10
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Okay, is there some kind of magictunnel to this hospital?

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
Ross, you stay here and talk.I'm gonna go have a baby.

12
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene. I'mRoss Geller. We called from the car.

13
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
We have a semi-privatelabor room waiting...

14
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?We asked for a private room.

15
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
Yes, I see that here.We can't guarantee a private room.

16
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53
- Currently, they're all unavailable.- Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.

17
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
I'm sorry. Semi-private roomsare all we have.

18
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?

19
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
- Give her some money.- I really think they're out of rooms.

20
00:01:05 --> 00:01:09
They're saving them for importantpeople! What if I was the president?

21
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
We'd be in a lot of trouble.You don't know where any countries are.

22
00:01:14 --> 00:01:15
Okay.

23
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
Say, would you mind checking again?

24
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
See if any private roomsmay have opened up?

25
00:01:23 --> 00:01:24
This is a hospital.

26
00:01:24 --> 00:01:27
You know what?I don't really care for your tone.

27
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
This is not the only hospital in thecity. We have no problem... Oh, gosh!

28
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34

59
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.

60
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47

62
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54

64
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
Listen, I've been doingsome thinking...

65
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
...and I don't know whetherit's because we're here...

66
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
...or Rachel's giving birth...

67
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
...but I think we shouldtry to have a baby.

68
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
Okay.

69
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
What's that now?

70
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
Okay. I've been thinking about it too.I think we're ready.

71
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
Are you kidding? You thinkwe're ready to have a baby?

72
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
Oh, this is fun.

73
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
You're ready to have a baby?My boy's all grown up!

74
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
You said you were ready.

75
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
I was screwing with you to getyour voice high and weird...

76
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
...like mine is now!

77
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
Yes, but haven't youwanted a kid forever?

78
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
Okay, just back off, mister!

79
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
Because I am ready to have a baby.

80
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
I just want Joey to be the father.

81
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
- What? Are you crazy?- Right there! That's all I wanted!

82
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
I'm sorry. The doctor insistedon closing the curtain for the exam.

83
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
Oh, that's very...Really, very, very okay.

84
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
Julie's cervix is dilated sevencentimeters. That's about four fingers!

85
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
- Doctor let me feel it.- Have you felt Rachel's?

86
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
- No, I don't...- We won't be doing that.

87
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
Well, you could feel Rachel's,then feel mine to compare.

88
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
- Am I interrupting?- Yes! Thank you! Later.

89
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
- You can't leave me with them.- Sorry.

90
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
No, Ross, Ross? Ross?My child has no father!

91
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonnabe a while. I wish you'd called first.

92
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
I'm coming back later with your father.

93
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
- I need to talk to you before the birth.- Okay. What's up?

94
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
I brought somethingthat I want to give you.

95
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
Assuming, of course, that you want it.

96
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?

97
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
Your grandma's engagement ring,I want you to give it to Rachel.

98
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
- Mom, no. Come on. Thank you...- Just hear me out...

99
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
No! Okay? We're not gettingmarried because she's pregnant.

100
00:05:53 --> 00:05:59
Honestly, this isn't just some girlyou picked up in a bar and humped.

101
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
A child should have a family.

102
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
I can't deal with this now. I'm sorry.

103
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
Think about it. If you don't,I'll talk more about humping.

104
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
Give me that.

105
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
- Hi, dear.- Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

106
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
Ross, get in here!

107
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
She dragged me out of the labor roomto ask me why I'm not with Rachel.

108
00:06:23 --> 00:06:27
- Why aren't you with Rachel?- Are you kidding?

109
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
We're not gonna be togetherbecause we're having a baby!

110
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
It seems you belong together.

111
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
I can't deal with this right now.I have to go have a baby.

112
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
Right. And with who again?

113
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
He's crazy. Why doesn'the wanna be with Rachel?

114
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
I know.

115
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
She's like the perfect woman.I know she turned me down...

116
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
...but if she wanted to be with me,I would take her in my arms and...

117
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
I haven't bummed you guys outlike this in a while.

118
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
- Hey.- Hey.

119
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
- Who's that?- New people.

120
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
What happened to the Disgustingtons?

121
00:07:06 --> 00:07:11
They're having their baby.It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!

122
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
After you left, they wheeled her off.

123
00:07:13 --> 00:07:18
Not before she gave me a nice, juicyshot of little Jamie, crowning away.

124
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
Wow. Sorry.

125
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
So how are the new people?

126
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
Well, they have some unusualpet names for each other.

127
00:07:25 --> 00:07:30
Including "Evil Bitch"and "Sick Bastard."

128
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
- Oh, gosh, a contraction.- Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.

129
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
- Are you looking at her?- No!

130
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
- Don't look at her, you sick bastard!- I swear I wasn't looking at her!

131
00:07:40 --> 00:07:44
She's in labor. You like that,you sick son of a bitch?

132
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
I'm just gonna...

133
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
See? It's because you were looking,you fat pervert.

134
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.Just want some privacy.

135
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
You miss your girlfriend?

136
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
Just ignore them.

137
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
- You okay?- Yeah.

138
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
- Ross!- What?

139
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
- He's looking at me.- Hey!

140
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
Wanna live to see your baby?

141
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
Don't you talk to my husband like that,you stupid bastard!

142
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
Oh, good God! If you wanta baby so bad, just go steal it!

143
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
Since when are youso crazy about babies?

144
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
I'm not crazy about babies.I'm crazy about us.

145
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
What?

146
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
We talk about havingbabies someday, not now...

147
00:08:37 --> 00:08:42
...but I'm starting to think that wecan handle it. We're good.

148
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
We're really good.

149
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
We are pretty good.

150
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
But nothing has to happenuntil you're ready.

151
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
Well, maybe I'm ready now.

152
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
I mean, it's a little scary,but maybe it's right.

153
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
It's not right!We're not ready for a kid!

154
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
- What?- I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.

155
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
So we're gonna try?I mean, we're trying?

156
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
We're trying to get pregnant.

157
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
I'm not comfortable doingthis in front of the babies.

158
00:09:14 --> 00:09:19
- So when do you want to start trying?- All right, hold on a sec.

159
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
- Period math?- Yeah.

160
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
Well, we could start trying now.

161
00:09:25 --> 00:09:29
- Right here?- No, not here.

162
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
Maybe here.

163
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
We got time to kill. We're ina building that's full of beds!

164
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
And it's so clean!

165
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!

166
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
- It ate your money?- No.

167
00:09:49 --> 00:09:53
- I'll see you downstairs then.- All right.

168
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
Hey, I got one! I got one!

169
00:09:58 --> 00:09:58
- Hi.- Hi.

170
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
- Oh, up or down?- Oh. Down, please.

171
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
I hate to be a ball-buster,but can I just do it?

172
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
- Could you press up too?- Sure.

173
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
- I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.- How did yours happen?

174
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
It's a long, embarrassing story.

175
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
Let's just say, there was atypographical error with a sex manual.

176
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
- How about you?- Car accident.

177
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
- Idiot on a cell not paying attention?- Yeah. Me.

178
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
Oh, hey, that's me.

179
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
Hey, I take it you'rejust visiting someone.

180
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
Well, if you have some time,and you wanna visit someone else...

181
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
Yeah. I would like that.

182
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
- Great. I'm in room...- Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!

183
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
You gotta press the button.

184
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
They're bringing in another woman.

185
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
Oh. Is she pregnant yet?

186
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
She doesn't need to be.She'll still have the baby before I do.

187
00:10:59 --> 00:11:03
- Oh, Ross! Another contraction.- Oh, okay. Here, here.

188
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
That's it.

189
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
- Oh, that sounded like a bad one.- Yeah, it was.

190
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
Mine haven't been so bad.Oh, here comes one now.

191
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
Oh, that was a big one.

192
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
Could you help me? The patientI'm looking for has a broken leg.

193
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
He's in a wheelchair. He's earlyto mid-30s, very attractive.

194
00:11:30 --> 00:11:34
- I know who you're talking about.- Great! What room is he in?

195
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
Sorry. That information is restricted.

196
00:11:36 --> 00:11:41
- She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.- Dr. Drake who?

197
00:11:41 --> 00:11:46
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.We need that information. I'm a doctor.

198
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
- At this hospital?- Damn it! We're losing precious time.

199
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
You want this man's bloodon your head... Hands!

200
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
It is essential that you tell mewhat room he is staying in.

201
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
He's a patient of mine.

- That's him!- Great. Go get him!

215
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
Wait a second.Or maybe you could go in first.

216
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
He's not really my type.

217
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask himquestions and see what he's like.

218
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
- People tell doctors everything.- You said he's great.

219
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
Guys I meet seem nice at first,then turn out to be big jerks.

220
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
- You do attract some stinkers.- I know.

221
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
Dr. Long, I've been at thisfor 17 hours.

222
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
Three women have had their babies.

223
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
Give me good news. How manycentimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?

224
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
- Three.- Just 3?

225
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
I'm dilated 3!

226
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
We are moving along slowly.Don't worry, you're doing great.

227
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
- I'll be back soon.- Thank you.

228
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
I'm not waiting.I'm gonna push this baby out.

229
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.That's gotta be like this, right?

230
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
- Actually, it's more like this.- Oh, stupid metric system.

231
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
Oh! Oh! Oh!

232
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
We'll take you straightto the delivery room.

233
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
Oh, for the love of God!

234
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a fewroutine questions I need to ask you.

235
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.

236
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
I know. I'm a neurologist.To be safe...

237
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
...Dr. Wells wanted a morecomprehensive overview. So he sent me.

238
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
Dr. Wells is a woman!

239
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
That was a test. Good response.

240
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
- All right. Full name?- Clifford Burnett.

241
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
- Date of birth?- November 16, 1968.

242
00:14:24 --> 00:14:25
Age?

243
00:14:27 --> 00:14:31
- Can't you figure that out?- I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.

244
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
- I'm 33.- Okay.

245
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
- And are you married?- No.

246
00:14:37 --> 00:14:42
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Wouldyou say you have commitment issues?

247
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
Are all the questions this personal?

248
00:14:46 --> 00:14:47
Yes.

249
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.

250
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
- Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.- Yeah.

251
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
Do you sleep with womenand never call them again?

252
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
- No.- Excellent. Excellent.

253
00:15:00 --> 00:15:05
And finally, are you into any weirdstuff, you know, sexually?

254
00:15:06 --> 00:15:09
- No!- Wrong answer.

255
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
- What else? What else?- He's 33.

256
00:15:13 --> 00:15:14
- A widower.- Oh!

257
00:15:14 --> 00:15:19
He seemed like a standup guy. Andhe's not into anything weird sexually.

258
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
Enter Pheebs!

259
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
- This room's available.- Okay! Wait, listen to me!

260
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
Since I've been waiting,four women...

261
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
...one higher than the centimetersI'm dilated...

262
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
...have come and gone with their babies.I'm next. My turn. It's only fair.

263
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
If you bring in one more woman who hasher baby before me, I will sue you.

264
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.My husband is a lawyer.

265
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
- Rach?- You get back on that case, honey!

266
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
I don't think the nextpatient is far along.

267
00:15:50 --> 00:15:53
Okay. Well, then bring her in.

268
00:15:59 --> 00:16:04
Oh, my God!

269
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
I can't believe this!

270
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
And yet, somehow, it's true.

271
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
I mean, this is so great.We're gonna be baby buddies!

272
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
Squeeze your legs together,cover the baby's ears.

273
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
- Hi, sweetie!- Hi, sweetheart.

274
00:16:34 --> 00:16:37
This is my husband, Sid.I don't think you've met him.

275
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
I nabbed him at the dermatologist's.Thank God for adult acne!

276
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
I can't believe it.I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

277
00:16:46 --> 00:16:47
Really?

278
00:16:48 --> 00:16:49
What did he say?

279
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
You have to speak loudly,he's almost completely deaf.

280
00:16:52 --> 00:16:55
- Oh, there you go.- Of course he is.

281
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
Congratulations!I didn't even know you got married.

282
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
- Oh, no. We didn't.- What?

283
00:17:01 --> 00:17:05
We're just having this baby together,but that's all. You know?

284
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
Why?

285
00:17:09 --> 00:17:14
We're just not in that place, you know?But we're very excited about this.

286
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
Oh. Well, then shut me up.

287
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
Just tell me how.

288
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
Oh, I feel another one coming.

289
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
[ENGLISH]

290
00:17:34 --> 00:17:35
"Previously on" Friends:

291
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
I've been at this for 17 hours.

292
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
- How many centimeters am I dilated?- Three.

293
00:17:39 --> 00:17:42
Just three? I'm dilated three!

294
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
- We talk about having babies someday.- We're gonna try?

295
00:17:45 --> 00:17:48
- Right here?- No, not here.

296
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
Maybe here.

297
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
Your grandma's engagement ring,I want you to give it to Rachel.

298
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
- Mom, no.- This isn't some girl...

299
00:17:55 --> 00:17:58
...you picked up in a barand humped.

300
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
I take it you're just visiting someone?

301
00:18:02 --> 00:18:03
- Wanna visit someone else?- I would like that.

302
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
- That's him.- Great. Go get him!

303
00:18:06 --> 00:18:07
Maybe you could go in first.

304
00:18:08 --> 00:18:11
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.I have a few routine questions.

305
00:18:11 --> 00:18:14
Do you sleep with womenand never call them again?

306
00:18:14 --> 00:18:18
Oh, my God!

307
00:18:26 --> 00:18:29
Should we tell Rachel there's an emptyroom right next to hers?

308
00:18:30 --> 00:18:33
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

309
00:18:33 --> 00:18:37
Well, let me think about that.While I remove my pants!

310
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!

311
00:18:49 --> 00:18:52
Does that sound like Janice?

312
00:18:52 --> 00:18:54
If it's not, then there's two of them.

313
00:18:54 --> 00:18:57
And that would meanit's the end of the world!

314
00:18:57 --> 00:18:59
The One Where Rachel has a Baby - Part II

315
00:19:29 --> 00:19:30
Hey.

316
00:19:30 --> 00:19:31
- Hey.- Hi.

317
00:19:31 --> 00:19:34
I can't believe this is taking so long.How are you?

318
00:19:34 --> 00:19:39
Not bad. You know that feeling, tryingto blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?

319
00:19:40 --> 00:19:43
Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?

320
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
Mother of God, it's true!

321
00:19:46 --> 00:19:49
Chandler Bing!

322
00:19:49 --> 00:19:50
Janice.

323
00:19:50 --> 00:19:54
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.Contracting and everything.

324
00:19:55 --> 00:19:57
Oh, this should be easy.I have a very wide pelvis.

325
00:19:58 --> 00:20:00
You remember, Chandler.

326
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
I didn't know you were pregnant.

327
00:20:03 --> 00:20:07
Who's the unwitting humanwhose essence you've stolen?

328
00:20:08 --> 00:20:10
It's you.

329
00:20:10 --> 00:20:12
This is yours.

330
00:20:12 --> 00:20:13
What?

331
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
Look how nervous he gets!We haven't slept together in years!

332
00:20:19 --> 00:20:22
That's funny. Does it hurt?Does the labor hurt?

333
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
Okay, I have one.If you had to, which would you eat?

334
00:20:27 --> 00:20:31
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

335
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

336
00:20:35 --> 00:20:39
'Cause at least I could explain to himthat you're making me eat him.

337
00:20:40 --> 00:20:42
- Oh. Somebody went to college.- Yeah.

338
00:20:43 --> 00:20:44
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

339
00:20:44 --> 00:20:47
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.

340
00:20:47 --> 00:20:49
Oh. I'll get it.

341
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
I usually get to know a girl betterbefore I let her spoon me.

342
00:20:54 --> 00:20:57
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

343
00:21:02 --> 00:21:06
Oh, that's five, Ross.Five women have had five babies...

344
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
...and I have had no babies.

345
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
Why doesn't she want to come out?

346
00:21:11 --> 00:21:14
I think you made such a nicehome for her...

347
00:21:14 --> 00:21:17
...the last nine months,that she just doesn't want to leave.

348
00:21:17 --> 00:21:22
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.

349
00:21:23 --> 00:21:25
- Oh, God.- Okay. Okay.

350
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

351
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
Do something! Get me drugs...

352
00:21:30 --> 00:21:33
...or you light a fire up in thereand just smoke it out!

353
00:21:34 --> 00:21:37
I think you're ready to goto the delivery room.

354
00:21:37 --> 00:21:38
What?

355
00:21:38 --> 00:21:42
Ten centimeters.You're about to become a mom.

356
00:21:42 --> 00:21:45
Oh, my God. Okay.

357
00:21:45 --> 00:21:48
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.

358
00:21:53 --> 00:21:57
Oh, my God! That's the doctorwho was in my room before.

359
00:21:58 --> 00:22:01
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.

360
00:22:02 --> 00:22:05
I'm telling you, the guyfrom that show was here...

361
00:22:05 --> 00:22:08
...asking me all these weird questions.

362
00:22:08 --> 00:22:11
Do you really believe that a characterfrom a TV show was here?

363
00:22:11 --> 00:22:13
Rachel's having her baby!

364
00:22:15 --> 00:22:17
That's him! You know him?

365
00:22:17 --> 00:22:20
Okay. Okay. L... Okay.

366
00:22:21 --> 00:22:24
I sent my friend, Joey,in here to find out stuff about you.

367
00:22:24 --> 00:22:27
If it, you know, if it helps,you came off great.

368
00:22:27 --> 00:22:30
A lot better than I'm coming offright now.

369
00:22:30 --> 00:22:34
I don't believe this. You had himpretend he was a fake doctor?

370
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

371
00:22:37 --> 00:22:42
- You tried making me think I was crazy?- That was wrong. I'm so sorry.

372
00:22:42 --> 00:22:46
It's just that I liked you so much.Can we just start over?

373
00:22:46 --> 00:22:47
I don't think so.

374
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
If I may? You told me a lotof personal stuff about you, right?

375
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
Now, maybe it would help if you knewsome personal stuff about her.

376
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
She was married to a gay ice dancer.

377
00:22:58 --> 00:23:02
She gave birth to herbrother's triplets.

378
00:23:03 --> 00:23:07
Her twin sister used to do porn.

379
00:23:08 --> 00:23:11
- We're trying to dial down the crazy.- Right.

380
00:23:13 --> 00:23:16
We don't know each other,so it'd be easy to forget this...

381
00:23:16 --> 00:23:20
...but there's something between us.I don't know about you...

382
00:23:20 --> 00:23:22
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

383
00:23:23 --> 00:23:27
- It doesn't happen to me, either.- Me, neither!

384
00:23:28 --> 00:23:32
Push. Push. We're gonna pushfor five more seconds.

385
00:23:32 --> 00:23:34
Five, four...

386
00:23:34 --> 00:23:36
Three, two, one! Oh!

387
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
The next contraction will bein 20 seconds.

388
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
- I can't push anymore!- You're doing great.

389
00:23:41 --> 00:23:44
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

390
00:23:44 --> 00:23:46
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

391
00:23:46 --> 00:23:48
- Come on.- Push. Wait.

392
00:23:48 --> 00:23:51
- I see something.- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!

393
00:23:51 --> 00:23:53
- Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!- What is that?

394
00:23:54 --> 00:23:56
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.

395
00:23:56 --> 00:23:59
- I thought she had two heads.- Oh, God!

396
00:23:59 --> 00:24:00
Will she be okay?

397
00:24:00 --> 00:24:01
- She'll be fine.- Yeah.

398
00:24:02 --> 00:24:04
She's in a difficult position,so push hard.

399
00:24:04 --> 00:24:06
- Okay.- Go. Come on. Go! Go!

400
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
You'll have to push harder.

401
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
- I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

402
00:24:12 --> 00:24:15
I can't do it.Please, you do it for me!

403
00:24:15 --> 00:24:21
Let's go. One more time.One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

404
00:24:21 --> 00:24:23
Good.

405
00:24:23 --> 00:24:25
Keep pushing!

406
00:24:25 --> 00:24:28
Are you okay?

407
00:24:29 --> 00:24:32
You have no idea how much this hurts.

408
00:24:33 --> 00:24:36
Keep going! Keep going!

409
00:24:36 --> 00:24:37
Here we go!

410
00:24:37 --> 00:24:40
She's upside down, but she's coming!

411
00:24:40 --> 00:24:42
- Oh, God!- Oh! Oh, my God!

412
00:24:42 --> 00:24:44
Oh, my God, she's here.

413
00:24:47 --> 00:24:49
Oh, she's perfect.

414
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.

415
00:24:56 --> 00:24:59
- Where'd she go?- They're just wrapping her up.

416
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
Okay. Well, be careful with her,she's really tiny.

417
00:25:04 --> 00:25:07
Here she is.

418
00:25:15 --> 00:25:18
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

419
00:25:19 --> 00:25:22
I know. Oh.

420
00:25:25 --> 00:25:29
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

421
00:25:30 --> 00:25:32
- Do we have a name yet?- No, not yet.

422
00:25:33 --> 00:25:35
Fine. For now we'll justcall her Baby Girl Greene.

423
00:25:36 --> 00:25:38
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.

424
00:25:52 --> 00:25:54
Hello, Baby Girl.

425
00:25:59 --> 00:26:01
- Can we come in?- Oh, come on in.

426
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
- Oh, there she is.- Oh, she's so beautiful.

427
00:26:04 --> 00:26:05
Here.

428
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

429
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunkand had sex.

430
00:26:14 --> 00:26:17
It's incredible. I mean,one minute she's inside you...

431
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
...and then 47 hours later,here she is.

432
00:26:24 --> 00:26:27
She looks so real.

433
00:26:28 --> 00:26:29
You know what I mean.

434
00:26:29 --> 00:26:32
- Okay, my turn. My turn.- Aunt Phoebe.

435
00:26:32 --> 00:26:35
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!

436
00:26:35 --> 00:26:38
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

437
00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
I won't.

438
00:26:41 --> 00:26:45
- Honey, what's the matter?- Nothing. I just can't stop crying.

439
00:26:46 --> 00:26:49
The doctor said it's normal,plus you're sleep-deprived.

440
00:26:49 --> 00:26:50
You guys are all sleep-deprived.

441
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
I don't see you weeping because youput your slippers on the wrong feet.

442
00:26:55 --> 00:26:56
Oh, God.

443
00:26:57 --> 00:27:00
- What's the matter now?- I was reliving it.

444
00:27:01 --> 00:27:03
Do you know what you're gonnacall her yet?

445
00:27:04 --> 00:27:08
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?I thought that was so original.

446
00:27:08 --> 00:27:11
Actually, we've narrowed itdown to two.

447
00:27:11 --> 00:27:16
And you know what? I love them both.So just pick one, and that'll be it.

448
00:27:16 --> 00:27:20
Wow, okay. Everyone?

449
00:27:20 --> 00:27:24
This is Isabella.

450
00:27:24 --> 00:27:27
- Hi, Isabella!- Hi.

451
00:27:29 --> 00:27:30
What?

452
00:27:30 --> 00:27:32
That's not her name.

453
00:27:33 --> 00:27:35
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feellike an Isabella.

454
00:27:36 --> 00:27:37
- What was the other one?- Delilah.

455
00:27:38 --> 00:27:41
Oh, great! At least shesounds like a biblical whore.

456
00:27:44 --> 00:27:47
So, I guess we're back to Baby Girl.

457
00:27:48 --> 00:27:49
What will we do?

458
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
- You'll find a name.- Easy for you to say.

459
00:27:52 --> 00:27:54
You know what yourkids' names will be.

460
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
- You do?- I had them picked out since I was 14.

461
00:27:58 --> 00:28:02
Oh, no, it's gonna be named aftersome snack or baked good, isn't it?

462
00:28:04 --> 00:28:08
- Well, tell us, what are they?- Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

463
00:28:08 --> 00:28:11
- And if it's a girl?- I don't want to say.

464
00:28:11 --> 00:28:15
Oh, stop. Tell us.We're not gonna want it.

465
00:28:15 --> 00:28:17
Okay. It's Emma.

466
00:28:17 --> 00:28:19
Emma.

467
00:28:22 --> 00:28:25
See, I don't want it.

468
00:28:28 --> 00:28:31
- Take it.- What?

469
00:28:31 --> 00:28:32
She's clearly an Emma.

470
00:28:33 --> 00:28:35
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

471
00:28:35 --> 00:28:38
Yeah. But I love you more.

472
00:28:40 --> 00:28:43
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.So I'm screwed.

473
00:28:48 --> 00:28:52
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would liketo say hello to his future bride.

474
00:28:53 --> 00:28:54
Oh.

475
00:28:59 --> 00:29:02
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,doesn't he?

476
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
He's a keeper.

477
00:29:05 --> 00:29:08
- How are you feeling?- Oh, I'm fine.

478
00:29:09 --> 00:29:14
I really admire what you're doing.Just raising her all alone.

479
00:29:14 --> 00:29:16
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

480
00:29:16 --> 00:29:21
Sure. Now. But what happens when hemeets somebody else and gets married?

481
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
Well, then he gets a divorce.It's Ross.

482
00:29:26 --> 00:29:28
I'm telling you. Listen to Janice.

483
00:29:29 --> 00:29:34
They all say they're gonna be there,until they start their real family.

484
00:29:34 --> 00:29:37
- That's never gonna happen with Ross.- That's what I thought.

485
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spenda weekend with her father...

486
00:29:41 --> 00:29:43
...and little Miss New Boobs.

487
00:29:43 --> 00:29:45
Really?

488
00:29:46 --> 00:29:47
I hate to be the one to say it...

489
00:29:48 --> 00:29:52
...but, honey, you two are on your own.

490
00:29:52 --> 00:29:55
Well, that's, you know, that's...

491
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
We've been alone for the last20 minutes and we're doing okay.

492
00:29:59 --> 00:30:01
Maybe we won't be alone.

493
00:30:01 --> 00:30:05
Because lately things have beenhappening between me and Ross.

494
00:30:05 --> 00:30:09
And right before I went into labor,we had this kiss. You know?

495
00:30:09 --> 00:30:14
So it might be the beginningof something.

496
00:30:14 --> 00:30:16
- Hey, Janice.- Oh, hi.

497
00:30:17 --> 00:30:20
Who's this little guy?

498
00:30:20 --> 00:30:24
- Aaron, your future son-in-law.- Oh, no, no.

499
00:30:24 --> 00:30:27
- I'm gonna leave you three alone.- Okay.

500
00:30:28 --> 00:30:30
Man, you see the kid on that nose?

501
00:30:33 --> 00:30:35
You know what I was thinking about?

502
00:30:37 --> 00:30:42
That kiss before we left the apartment.That was something, huh?

503
00:30:43 --> 00:30:45
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

504
00:30:45 --> 00:30:48
But we, we gotta be careful.

505
00:30:48 --> 00:30:51
We... You know, we can't letthat happen again, you know?

506
00:30:53 --> 00:30:54
Right.

507
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
- We don't want to go down that road.- No. That's why I brought it up.

508
00:31:02 --> 00:31:05
- They didn't have any sodas?- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

509
00:31:06 --> 00:31:09
I was talking to this nurse.Completely forgot.

510
00:31:10 --> 00:31:12
And so it begins.

511
00:31:18 --> 00:31:19
She in there?

512
00:31:19 --> 00:31:22
Yeah. She's putting her down now.That's her.

513
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26
- Look at Emma.- I can't decide who she looks like.

514
00:31:26 --> 00:31:29
Oh, what, are you kidding?She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.

515
00:31:33 --> 00:31:37
I'm sorry. For the last time,why aren't you two together again?

516
00:31:37 --> 00:31:40
No, I know.Because you're not in that place.

517
00:31:40 --> 00:31:43
Which would be fine,except you totally are.

518
00:31:43 --> 00:31:46
It's complicated, okay?

519
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
You love her, you always have,you have a child together.

520
00:31:50 --> 00:31:52
There's no right answer.

521
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
Look, we've been together.Then apart. Then together, then apart.

522
00:31:57 --> 00:32:00
And now we have a baby.

523
00:32:01 --> 00:32:05
It's just, if we got together againand it didn't work out?

524
00:32:06 --> 00:32:08
I could never do that to Emma.

525
00:32:09 --> 00:32:14
I mean, she came into this worldthinking everything... Now me.

526
00:32:14 --> 00:32:17
What, do they put somethingin the water here?

527
00:32:18 --> 00:32:21
It's just, Rachel and I,we're doing really well now.

528
00:32:21 --> 00:32:24
I know. If you try to make it more,you might wreck it.

529
00:32:24 --> 00:32:26
- Yeah, exactly.- Right.

530
00:32:28 --> 00:32:31
Or you might get everythingyou've wanted since you were 15.

531
00:32:38 --> 00:32:40
Hey.

532
00:32:40 --> 00:32:43
I saw a woman breastfeedingtwins at the same time.

533
00:32:43 --> 00:32:45
It is like a freak show up here.

534
00:32:45 --> 00:32:47
- What's the matter?- Nothing.

535
00:32:47 --> 00:32:48
What is it? Hey?

536
00:32:49 --> 00:32:52
- Really, it's nothing. I'm...- Rach, come on. What?

537
00:32:53 --> 00:32:57
I've just been thinking about howmy baby and I are gonna be all alone.

538
00:32:57 --> 00:32:59
What are you talking about?What about Ross?

539
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
Please. He'll be with his real family.The twins and little Miss New Boobs.

540
00:33:05 --> 00:33:07
Okay, how longwas I watching that woman?

541
00:33:08 --> 00:33:10
I'm just saying that, you know...

542
00:33:10 --> 00:33:12
...someday Ross is gonnameet somebody...

543
00:33:13 --> 00:33:15
...and he's gonna have his own life.

544
00:33:15 --> 00:33:16
Right?

545
00:33:17 --> 00:33:18
Yeah, I guess so.

546
00:33:20 --> 00:33:24
I just never thought I'd be raisingthis baby all by myself.

547
00:33:24 --> 00:33:26
That's pretty dumb, huh?

548
00:33:26 --> 00:33:29
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

549
00:33:29 --> 00:33:32
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

550
00:33:32 --> 00:33:36
Okay? I promise Iwon't let that happen.

551
00:33:37 --> 00:33:41
Joey. Oh, sweetie,what would I do without you?

552
00:33:42 --> 00:33:44
You don't have to worry about that,okay?

553
00:33:47 --> 00:33:50
Could you grab me my other boxof tissues?

554
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
- They're under Ross' coat.- Sure.

555
00:34:00 --> 00:34:02
Oh, my God!

556
00:34:02 --> 00:34:04
Joey?

557
00:34:06 --> 00:34:08
Oh, my God.

558
00:34:12 --> 00:34:14
Okay.

559
00:34:41 --> 00:34:44
- That was amazing.- I know.

560
00:34:45 --> 00:34:50
Hey, do you realize that we may havejust changed our lives forever?

561
00:34:50 --> 00:34:54
We may have started our family.In nine months we could be here...

562
00:34:54 --> 00:34:55
...having our own baby.

563
00:34:56 --> 00:34:58
And if not, we got to do iton a bucket.

564
