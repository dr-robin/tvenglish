I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
Man, this is weird.

4
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch'seyebrows are on his hat?

5
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
That's what's weird?

6
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
The man's been captainof a cereal for 40 years.

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
What?

8
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
The spoon!You licked and you put.

9
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
You licked and you put.

10
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
Yeah, so?

11
00:00:22 --> 00:00:26
Don't you see how gross that is?It's like you using my toothbrush!

12
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
You used my toothbrush?

13
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
Only because I used the red oneto unclog the drain.

14
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Mine is the red one!

15
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
Oh, God!Can open. Worms everywhere!

16
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

17
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
...but we can use the same soap?

18
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
Because soap is soap.It's self-cleaning.

19
00:00:47 --> 00:00:48
The next time you shower...

20
00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
...think about the last thing I washand the first thing you wash.

00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
Look at you fancy lads!

24
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
What's the occasion?

25
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
You know that guy on my showthat's in a coma?

26
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
He's having a brunch.

27
00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
Ready when you are.

28
00:01:45 --> 00:01:47
I can't believe you'reactually getting tattoos.

29
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
You guys are getting tattoos?

30
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
But you cannot tell Rossbecause I wanna surprise him.

31
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
Wow, this is wild!What are you gonna get?

32
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
I'm getting a lily.

33
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

34
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
That's lucky. What ifher name was Big Ugly Splotch?

35
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
- Where you getting it?- On my shoulder.

36
00:02:06 --> 00:02:06
What?

37
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
What's on your shoulder?

38
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
A chip.

39
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
- A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.- A tattoo?

40
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

41
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
You don't thinkthey're kind of cool?

42
00:02:19 --> 00:02:20
No. Sorry, I don't.

43
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Why would anyone pay someoneto scar their body for life?

44
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
What if it doesn't come out right?

45
00:02:25 --> 00:02:29
It's like havinga bad haircut all the time.

46
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
Why is everyone staring at me?

47
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Sign this card for Dad.Richard will be here soon.

48
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Richard's going to the party too?

49
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
He's my parents' best friend.He has to go.

50
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
So is today the dayyou'll tell them about you two?

51
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,I decided to give him a stroke.

52
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
No, I think you should tell them.

53
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
I don't know how serious he is.Until I do, I won't say anything.

54
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
I don't thinkMom and Dad would mind.

55
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
Remember when you were 9and Richard was 30, Dad said...

56
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
..."God, I hope they get together."

57
00:02:59 --> 00:03:00
Shall we?

58
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
Okay, wait.

59
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
You know what?

60
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
Ross, let's switch places.You get in the middle.

61
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
This looks like we're tryingto cover something up.

62
00:03:09 --> 00:03:13
You could come in straddling him,they still wouldn't believe it.

63
00:03:14 --> 00:03:15
We're here!

64
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
- Hi, kids!- The children!

65
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
- Happy birthday, Dad.- Thank you.

66
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
Happy birthday!

67
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
So you kids thankedDr. Burke for the ride?

68
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
Actually, Mom, I think Monicathanked him for the both of us.

69
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
So you kids take the train in?

70
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

71
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
Speaking of whom...

72
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
...I hear he's got some20-year-old twinkie in the city.

73
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

74
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

75
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
So Richard's shoppingin the junior section?

76
00:03:47 --> 00:03:48
Are we still on that?

77
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
You just know she's gotthe IQ of a napkin.

78
00:03:52 --> 00:03:53
She's probably not even pretty.

79
00:03:53 --> 00:03:58
Just young enough so thateverything is still pointing up.

80
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
Can you believe this place?

81
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
I know. This is a great apartment.

82
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
In the bathroom there's mirrorson both sides of you.

83
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
When you're in there, it's likepeeing with the Rockettes.

84
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

85
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Seriously.

86
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
We were just saying, great apartment!

87
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
Thanks. You want it?

88
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
I'm moving to a bigger place.

89
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
You should take this one.

90
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
Can you see me in a place like this?

91
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
Why not? You hate park viewsand high ceilings?

92
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

93
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
That's all right,I saw a kitchen this morning.

94
00:04:33 --> 00:04:34
On TV.

95
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
Stop talking. Okay!

96
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
- Come on, tell us!- Is she really 20?

97
00:04:39 --> 00:04:40
I am not telling you guys anything.

98
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
Come on, it's my birthday.Let me live vicariously!

99
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

100
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
What's a little midlife crisisbetween friends?

101
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
Would you let it go?

102
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
I know what you're going through.When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

103
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
You got your own little speedster.

104
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
- Seriously, it's not like that.- Tell you what.

105
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
Maybe one of these weekendsyou can borrow the car and I could...

106
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
Dad, I beg you notto finish that sentence!

107
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
What? I'm kidding!

108
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
You know I'd never let himtouch the Porsche.

109
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Okay, Rach.

110
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
Which lily?This lily or that lily?

111
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
- Well, I...- I like this lily.

112
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
It's more openand that's like my mom.

113
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
She had a more open, giving spirit.

114
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
Foghorn Leghorn!

115
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
Blonde girl?You're in room two.

116
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
Not-so-blonde girl, you're with me.

117
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
Here we go!

118
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
You're not going.

119
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
Is this because of what Ross said?

120
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
- Well, yeah, maybe.- I don't believe this.

121
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
Is this how this relationship works?Ross equals boss?

122
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
Come on, what is this, 1922?

123
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
What's 1922?

124
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
Just, you know, a long time ago.

125
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
When men used to tell womenwhat to do a lot.

126
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
Then there was suffrage, which wasa good thing. But it sounds horrible.

127
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
Do you want this tattoo?

128
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
Yes, I do.It's just that Ross...

129
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

130
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
Who is the boss of you?

131
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
You?

132
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
You are the boss of you!

133
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
You march in there andget that tattoo on your hip!

134
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
Go!

135
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
How you doing?

136
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
I'm a twinkie!

137
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
Really? I'm a hero.

138
00:06:31 --> 00:06:32
This is so hard.

139
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

140
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

141
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
Maybe we should just tellyour parents first.

142
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
My parents are dead.

143
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
God, you are so lucky!

144
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
I mean...Well, you know what I mean.

145
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
Just hang in there, okay?

146
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

147
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
Judy! Going to the bathroom.Good for you!

148
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
Thank you, Richard.I appreciate the support.

149
00:07:08 --> 00:07:09
Honey.

150
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?Bob doesn't believe I have one.

151
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
I have no idea.

152
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
Did you know Richardhas a twinkie in the city?

153
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
I know. He's a new man.It's like a scene from "Cocoon".

154
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
I just never would havepictured Richard with a bimbo.

155
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
He told Johnny Shapirothat she's quite a girl.

156
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
He told Johnny that he thinkshe's falling in love with her.

157
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
- Really?- I've never seen him this happy.

158
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
So, Jack...

159
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
...ever think about trading me infor a younger model?

160
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
Of course not.

161
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
With you, it's likeI've got two 25-year-olds.

162
00:07:43 --> 00:07:44
Oh, Jack, stop!

163
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
Come on!

164
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
It's my birthday!

165
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
Can we drop this?

166
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
I am not interestedin the guy's apartment.

167
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
Oh, please. I saw the wayyou were checking out his moldings.

168
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
You want it.

169
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
Why would I want another apartment?

170
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
I've already gotan apartment that I love.

171
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
It wouldn't kill youto say it once in a while.

172
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
All right. You want the truth?I'm thinking about it.

173
00:08:12 --> 00:08:13
- What?- I'm sorry.

174
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

175
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
...and I'm at a placewhere I got enough money...

176
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
...that I don't need a roommate.

177
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
I don't need a roommate either.

178
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
I can afford to live here by myself.

179
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
I may have to bring in somebodyonce a week to lick the silverware.

180
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
Why are you gettingso bent out of shape?

181
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
We didn't agree to livetogether forever.

182
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
We're not Bert and Ernie.

183
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
You know what?

184
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
If this is the way you feel...

185
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
...then maybe you should take it.

186
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
- That's how I feel.- Then maybe you should take it!

187
00:08:42 --> 00:08:43
Maybe I will!

188
00:08:43 --> 00:08:44
- Fine with me!- Great!

189
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
You can spend more quality timewith your real friends...

190
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
...the spoons!

191
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
Whose drink can I freshen?

192
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
Almost time for cake!

193
00:09:02 --> 00:09:03
Mon, are you okay?

194
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
You remember that videoI found of Mom and Dad?

195
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
Well, I just caught the live show.

196
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
- Hey, there.- What?

197
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
Nothing. I just heardsomething nice about you.

198
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Really?

199
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
- Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?- Not that I know of.

200
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
I was thinking, why doesn'the give Monica a call?

201
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
That's an idea.

202
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
Well, actually,I'm already seeing someone.

203
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
Oh?

204
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
She never tells us anything.

205
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
Ross, did you knowMonica's seeing someone?

206
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
Mom, there areso many people in my life.

207
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
Some are seeing peopleand some aren't.

208
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
Is that crystal?

209
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
So who's the mystery man?

210
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
Well, he's a doctor.

211
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
A real doctor?

212
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
No, a doctor of meat.

213
00:10:06 --> 00:10:07
Of course he's a real doctor.

214
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
And he's handsome.

215
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
And he's sweet,and I know you'd like him.

216
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
Well, that's wonderful.

217
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
Mom, it's okay.

218
00:10:20 --> 00:10:21
It is, Judy.

219
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
Jack!

220
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
Could you come in here for a moment?

221
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
Now!

222
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
- Found it!- I'll take that, Dad.

223
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
It seems your daughter and Richardare something of an item.

224
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
That's impossible.He's got a twinkie in the city.

225
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
I'm the twinkie.

226
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
- You're the twinkie?- She's not a twinkie!

227
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
Look, this is the best relationshipI've been in...

228
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
Oh, please! A relationship?

229
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
Yes, a relationship!

230
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
For your information,I'm crazy about this man.

231
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
Really?

232
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
Am I supposed to stand hereand listen to this on my birthday?

233
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
This is a good thing. You saidyou've never seen Richard happier.

234
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
When did I say that?

235
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
Upstairs in the bathroom,right before you felt up Mom!

236
00:11:07 --> 00:11:08
Happy birthday to you

237
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
Happy birthday to you

238
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
Happy birthday, dear Jack

239
00:11:16 --> 00:11:20
Happy birthday to you

240
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
It looks so good!Oh, I love it.

241
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
I know, so do I!I'm so glad you made me do this.

242
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
Okay, let me see yours.

243
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
Let's see yours again.

244
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
We just saw mine.Let me see yours.

245
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Oh, no!

246
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
It's gone! That's so weird.

247
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
I don't know how, where it went.

248
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
You didn't get it?

249
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
Why not?

250
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

251
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
How could you do this to me?This was your idea!

252
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
I know! I was gonna get it,but he came in with this needle.

253
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
And did you knowthey do this with needles?

254
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
Really? You don't say?

255
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

256
00:12:05 --> 00:12:06
I'm sorry about what...

257
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
- Yeah, me too.- I know.

258
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
Do we need to hug?

259
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
No, we're all right.

260
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
So I got you something.

261
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
Plastic spoons!

262
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
- Great!- Lick away, my man!

263
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
These will go great in my new placetill I get real ones.

264
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
What?

265
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
I can't use these forever.They're no friend of the environment.

266
00:12:33 --> 00:12:35
No, I mean what's thisabout your new place?

267
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
I'm moving out,like we talked about.

268
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
I didn't think that was serious.

269
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
You know, I thoughtthat was just a fight.

270
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
Well, it was a fight...

271
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
...based on serious stuff, remember?

272
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
About how I neverlived alone or anything?

273
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
I think it would be good for me.Help me to grow...

274
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
...or whatever.

275
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Well, there you go.

276
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
Hey, are you cool with this?

277
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

278
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
I've never been lower or wetter.

279
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
I'll be fine.I'll just turn your...

280
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
...bedroom into a game room.

281
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
Put the foosball table in there.

282
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
Why do you get to keep the table?

283
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
I did pay for half of it.

284
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
I paid for the other half.

285
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
I'll tell you what.I'll play you for it.

286
00:13:24 --> 00:13:24
All right, you're on.

287
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
I can take two minutesout of my day to kick your ass.

288
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
Your men will get scored onmore times than your sister.

289
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
Which sister?

290
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
So are you sorry that I told them?

291
00:13:43 --> 00:13:48
No. It's been a long timesince your dad and I went running.

292
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
Did you get it?

293
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
- Is Ross here?- He went out for pizza.

294
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
Okay, really quick.

295
00:13:55 --> 00:13:56
That's great!

296
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
Very tasteful.

297
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?

298
00:14:00 --> 00:14:01
What? You didn't get one.

299
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
Okay. Well then, what is this?

300
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
What are we looking at?

301
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
That blue freckle?

302
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
That's my tattoo.

303
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
That is not a tattoo.That is a nothing.

304
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
I got her in the chair...

305
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
...he barely touched her with theneedle, she screamed and that was it.

306
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
Okay, hi!

307
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
For your information,this is exactly what I wanted.

308
00:14:25 --> 00:14:29
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seenfrom a great, great distance.

309
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
It's the way my mothersees me from heaven.

310
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
Oh, what a load of crap!

311
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
That is a dot!

312
00:14:37 --> 00:14:42
Your mother's in heaven going,"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

313
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
That is not a tattoo!This is a tattoo!

314
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
You got a tattoo?

315
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
Maybe.

316
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
But just a little one.Phoebe got the whole world!

317
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
Well, let me see.

318
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
Well?

319
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
Well, it's really...

320
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
...sexy.

321
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
I wouldn't have thoughtit would be, but...

322
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
...wow!

323
00:15:12 --> 00:15:13
Really?

324
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
So is it sore?Or can you do stuff?

325
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
I guess.

326
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
Save us some pizza.

327
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
Get it out of the corner!

328
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
Pass it! Pass it!

329
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
Stop talking to your men!

330
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
And the table is mine.

331
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
Congratulations.

332
00:15:51 --> 00:15:52
You guys will stillcome visit me, right?

333
00:15:53 --> 00:15:54
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

334
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
We'll be over there all the time.

335
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
Except when we are here.

336
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
I know you're just moving uptown,but I'll really miss you.

337
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
How can you not beacross the hall anymore?

338
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
Who's gonna eat all of our foodand tie up our phone lines...

339
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
Is that my bra?

340
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
- What are you doing with my bra?- It's not what you think.

341
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
We used it to flingwater balloons off the roof.

342
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
Remember? Those kids couldn'teven get theirs across the street.

343
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
Yeah, I remember.

344
00:16:27 --> 00:16:31
Let's bring the rest of thesedown to the truck.

345
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
You want me to...

346
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
...give you a handwith the foosball table?

347
00:16:44 --> 00:16:48
You keep it.You need the practice.

348
00:16:49 --> 00:16:50
Thanks.

349
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
So...

350
00:16:52 --> 00:16:53
...I guess this is it.

351
00:16:53 --> 00:16:54
Yeah, right.

352
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
I guess so.

353
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
When am I gonna see you?

354
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
I'm guessing tonightat the coffeehouse.

355
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
Right. Yeah. Okay.

356
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
Take care.
