1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
Wow! You look nice.What's the occasion?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
Monica and I are celebratingour 10-month anniversary.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
Got reservations at Jean-George.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
How'd you get in?

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Made a few calls,pulled some strings...

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:17
...and they'll seat us if we bothhave chicken and don't get dessert.

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:19
- Hi, Chandler.- Hey, Caitlin.

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:21
Somebody got a haircut.

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
I hate it. I look likean eight-year-old boy.

10
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
If that was true, gym classwould've been more interesting.

11
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
- It's $27 even.- Okay. Here you go.

12
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
Where's the chicken?

13
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
It's in the back.The duck pissed him off.

14
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
He said that eggs came first.

15
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
- Thanks. I'll see you later.- Bye.

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
What the hell was that?

17
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
- What?- The flirting.

18
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
Aren't you supposed to be going outwith, let's see, my sister?

19
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
I wasn't flirting.

20
00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
It was totally flirting!"Somebody got a haircut..."

21
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
First of all, the impression?Uncanny.

22
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
Second, that wasn't flirting.That was just casual conversation.

23
00:01:01 --> 00:01:02
Yeah, right.

24
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
You wanna see flirting?I'll show you.

25
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
I'm good.

26
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
The One Where Ross Can't Flirt

27
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
I am so proud of Joey.

28
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
- He's gonna be on "Law and Order"!- I know.

29
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
Don't you think it shouldbe called "Order and Law"?

30
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
No, because they arrest the guyand then try him.

31
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
Don't get me started on that.

32
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
- I was not flirting.- And on your anniversary. For shame!

33
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
What's going on?

34
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
He was hitting onthe hot delivery girl.

35
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
I was not. And oh, God!

36
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
You were. If anyoneshould be hitting on her...

37
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
...it's the guy who's single...

38
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
...the guy who can dosomething about it.

39
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
Sounds like someone wants to beMr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

40
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
Is that what this is about?You like Caitlin?

41
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
Ross, we broke up two years ago.You've been married since then.

42
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
I think it's okaythat we see other people.

43
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
I was watching herat the pizza place.

44
00:02:32 --> 00:02:36
And she was just so sexy and funnyand has the cutest little...

45
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
We don't need her measurements.

46
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.

47
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
She's pretty and you love her,but is she stupid?

48
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
She forgot my vegetarian.

49
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
This is perfect. She'll haveto come back here with your pizza.

50
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
And when she does,I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.

51
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
I am so glad you don't eat meat.

52
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.

53
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
Hey, everybody, look who's here!You remember my grandmother.

54
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
- Big night!- Yeah, it's so cool.

55
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
Joey on "Law and Order".You must be proud.

56
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
She doesn't understanda word of English.

57
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
I thought you wereJoey's other grandmother.

58
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
I've done it again.

59
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
Nonnie's my biggest fan.

60
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
She's the only one in the familywho's always believed in me.

61
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
"SÃ­." Big star.

62
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
My big fat Joey star.

63
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
Yeah, I weighed, like,27 pounds when I was born.

64
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
- Happy anniversary!- Happy anniversary, 10 months.

65
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
In the shower I was thinkingabout our first night in London.

66
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
Joey's grandmother's right there.

67
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
- The one who speaks English?- The one who doesn't.

68
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
That was some hot love you gave me.

69
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
- I'll get ready.- Wear those earrings I got you.

70
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
That's a great idea. I was savingthem for something special.

71
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
- You've got to go home.- But I like it here.

72
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
Get the earrings you borrowed.He wants me to wear them.

73
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
I think they're in my purse.Go get dressed and I'll look for them.

74
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
I need those earrings you borrowed.

75
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
Yeah, I'll be right back.

76
00:04:21 --> 00:04:22
Pheebs, you speak Italian?

77
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
I guess so.

78
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
- Here you go.- Thanks. Where's the other one?

79
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
Oh, what, you want both of them?

80
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
Rachel Karen Greene,where's the other one?

81
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
Look, just don't freak out,but I kind of lost it.

82
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
I know it's in the apartment,but I definitely lost it.

83
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
What'll I tell Monica?She wants to wear them tonight.

84
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
- Tell her to wear her own earrings.- These are her earrings.

85
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
You lent me her earrings?I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!

86
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
- Why not?- Because I lose her stuff!

87
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
You see that blind guy?I'm gonna bash his head in later.

88
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
My big scene's coming up.The big scene coming up.

89
00:05:07 --> 00:05:12
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up",would she know the difference?

90
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
What are you doing?

91
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
Oh, I just can't watch.It's too scary.

92
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
It's a diaper commercial.

93
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
Yeah, well, you know me.Babies, responsibilities...

94
00:05:25 --> 00:05:29
- Pizza delivery.- I'll get it! I will get that!

95
00:05:31 --> 00:05:35
One vegetarian pizza.It's 12.50.

96
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
By the way, if it makesyou feel any better...

97
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
...I happen to likeeight-year-old boys.

98
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
What?

99
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
Your hair.Before. Your hair.

100
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
You said you thought your hairlooked like an eight-year-old boy's...

101
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
...and I'm just saying I like it.

102
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
The hair.

103
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
Thanks.

104
00:05:59 --> 00:06:03
You understand, I don't actuallylike eight-year-old boys.

105
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
All I'm looking for is the money.

106
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
Here you go.Stop bringing us pizzas, you.

107
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
I'm gonna try.

108
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
You're welcome.

109
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
You couldn't let me have her,could you?

110
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
This is a girl I really like,and you had to swoop in there!

111
00:06:19 --> 00:06:19
What?

112
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
Chandler was flirtingwith the hot delivery girl.

113
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
Thank you for that.

114
00:06:26 --> 00:06:27
I was not flirting.

115
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
It's okay. I don't care.That's fine.

116
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
Really?

117
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
It's no big deal.I do it all the time.

118
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
You flirt with guys all the time?

119
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
It doesn't mean anything. Just likeit doesn't mean anything with you.

120
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
There's a difference.You're a lot hotter.

121
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
True story.

122
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
This actually bothers you?

123
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
Yes, and I thinkit'd bother a lot of people.

124
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
When you and Ross dated...

125
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
...did it bother youwhen he flirted with other women?

126
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
No, it bothered me whenhe slept with other women.

127
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
And thank you for that.

128
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
I never had to worry.

129
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
He was never goodat the flirting thing.

130
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
What are you talking about?It worked with you.

131
00:07:10 --> 00:07:11
No, you're right.

132
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
We met, you flirted and then bam!Nine years later, you had me.

133
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
All right.

134
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
You know what I'll do?I'll order another pizza.

135
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
And when Caitlin gets here...

136
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
...I will show you how well I flirt.

137
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
I will get her phone number.

138
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
And not the one on the menu.

139
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
- I found it.- Thank God! Where was it?

140
00:07:32 --> 00:07:33
On your dresser.

141
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
Okay, that is the one we already have.

142
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
Here's my big scene.My big scene's here.

143
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
- No bet.

144
00:07:42 --> 00:07:43
Anybody home?

145
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
- Oh, my God.- What?

146
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
Everybody keep smiling. It'll killmy grandmother if she finds out.

147
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
What is it?

148
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
They cut me out of the show.

149
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
What?

150
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
- Are you sure?- Maybe your scene's coming up.

151
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
Not likely. Because you seethat body bag right there?

152
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
I'm in it.

153
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
This is terrible.What'll you do?

154
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
I don't know. This littleold lady lives for my career.

155
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
When they dumped me off"Days of Our Lives", she almost died.

156
00:08:11 --> 00:08:12
That's not good.

157
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
You're not smiling. Not that face!Everybody smile!

158
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
Just tell her what happened.It's not your fault.

159
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
If we keep talking this way,won't we freak her out soon?

160
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
Soon. I'm gonna be on soon.

161
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
There I am!

162
00:08:29 --> 00:08:30
Sam Waterston!

163
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
No, no. That's me.That's me!

164
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
No. Sam Waterston.

165
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.

166
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
She doesn't know "hello",but she knows "Capricorn One".

167
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
I need those earrings.We're leaving when the show's over.

168
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
But I already gave them back to you.

169
00:08:47 --> 00:08:48
No, you didn't.

170
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
I already didn't gave them back to you.That's what I said.

171
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
Where's that other earring?

172
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
It's not here, Pheebs.It's not here.

173
00:08:56 --> 00:08:57
I went to Chandler's last night.

174
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
Make sure you checkChandler's jewelry box.

175
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
Chandler has a jewelry box?

176
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
We have 10 minutes. Do youwant me to get into that now?

177
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
Hey, Pheebs.

178
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
How's that...

179
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
...vegetarian pizzaworking out for you?

180
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
You and those vegetableshave a real...

181
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
...thing going on, huh?

182
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
Why are you being weird?

183
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
Do you like it?

184
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
No. That'd be,"Why are you being cute?"

185
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.

186
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
I did not get that.

187
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
So, Monica, do you like"Law and Order"?

188
00:09:39 --> 00:09:40
Yeah, it's good.

189
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
I found out all this stuff about you.You like "Law and Order"...

190
00:09:42 --> 00:09:46
...and you've flirted with every guyin the tri-state area.

191
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
Okay, let me get this straight.

192
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
It's okay for you to flirt,but not for me?

193
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
I'm glad we cleared that up.

194
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
I'm sorry, but some things aredifferent for men and women.

195
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
Teach me about men and women.

196
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
I've already taught youso much already, but whatever.

197
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
When you flirt with a guy,you think, "No big deal."

198
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
But he thinks, "Finally!Somebody who wants to sleep with me."

199
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
- No way!- It's true.

200
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
- Well, that's pathetic.- Again, true.

201
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
- This goes for all guys?- All guys that are awake.

202
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
We go to sleep.

203
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
All guys from the other end of theworld wake up and act the same way.

204
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
It's another commercialand I still haven't told her.

205
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
Joey, this is the last commercial.

206
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
- You got 10 minutes left.- I know!

207
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
What am I gonna do?

208
00:10:28 --> 00:10:32
You will not run outand leave her here.

209
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
Yeah, all right.

210
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
Joey's gonna be right back.Right back?

211
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.

212
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
So, you're old and small.

213
00:10:54 --> 00:10:55
Did you find it?

214
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
The earring, no.But I found my sunglasses.

215
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
I've been looking for thesesince last summer.

216
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
Those are mine.You borrowed them from me.

217
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
Okay. Calm down.Here they are.

218
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
- What do we do?- I don't know. I don't know!

219
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
We'll just haveto tell Monica, that's all.

220
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.

221
00:11:17 --> 00:11:18
I could tell her it was all my fault.

222
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
Oh, that'd be great.

223
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
Mon, could I talk to you?

224
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
Yeah. What is it?

225
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
I lost one of your earrings.

226
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

227
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
All right, what can you do?If you lost it, you lost it.

228
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
I'll replace it. I promise.I feel so terrible.

229
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
That's fine.You didn't do it on purpose.

230
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
Look at you. Come here.

231
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
- You feel better?- Yeah. You're the best.

232
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
Okay, wait a minute.

233
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
I can't do this.

234
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Listen, honey,it's not Phoebe's fault.

235
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
She lent me the earrings.

236
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.I feel terrible too.

237
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
That is exactly whyI do not lend you stuff!

238
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
First, my jewelry.If it's not that, it's my sweater.

239
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
And if it's not that,it's my sunglasses.

240
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
Your sunglasses?

241
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
Oh, right.

242
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
- Pizza.- Mine, mine, mine!

243
00:12:15 --> 00:12:16
Okay, here goes.

244
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
Prepare yourselvesfor some class-A flirting.

245
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
Okay, hold on.

246
00:12:23 --> 00:12:28
If you really like this girl, I don'tthink flirting is the right way...

247
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
You'll see.

248
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
What's her name?

249
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
Caitlin!

250
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
We can't keep eating like this.

251
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
It's $12.50.

252
00:12:52 --> 00:12:57
Do you make the pizzas in oneof those wood-burning ovens?

253
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
No, actually, I think they're gas.

254
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
Gas?

255
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
Intense.

256
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
If this is how all the Gellers flirt,we don't have a problem.

257
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
You know that smell gas has?

258
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
They put that in.

259
00:13:20 --> 00:13:21
What?

260
00:13:21 --> 00:13:22
The gas is odorless.

261
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
But they add the smellso you know when there's a leak.

262
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
Well, okay.

263
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
A lot of other gas smells.

264
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
Oh, the humanity!

265
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
Methane smells...

266
00:13:44 --> 00:13:47
You know what?Actually, I really should go.

267
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
- But I haven't paid you yet.- That's okay.

268
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
You guys have ordered so manythat this one's on me.

269
00:13:58 --> 00:14:02
Was I talking to her about gas?

270
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
More so than anything else.

271
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
I found it interesting.

272
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
Don't worry about it.

274
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
In nine years, she and Iwill be right there!

275
00:14:21 --> 00:14:25
I'm gonna clear outsome of these boxes.

276
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
What else do they add smell to?

277
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
Caitlin! Caitlin!

278
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
Hi, I'm Rachel.

279
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
The people with all the pizza.

280
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
Was there a problem?

281
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
No, they're fine. Great pizza.

282
00:14:44 --> 00:14:50
But, actually, my friend Rossgets nervous when he's flirting.

283
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
Oh, my God!

284
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
That was flirting?

285
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
I know, I know.

286
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
I'm telling you,once you get past that part...

287
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
...where it feelslike you wanna die...

288
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
...he's a really good person.

289
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
The guy with the gas?

290
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
I'm telling you, he's reallysweet and really funny...

291
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
...and he's just got a good heart.

292
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
- Besides, I think he really likes you.- Really?

293
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
Well, we have seven peopleand 10 pizzas. What do you think?

294
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
I thought Joey was there.

295
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
Hey, Ross?

296
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
I just ran into Caitlinin the hallway.

297
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
You must be getting better atthis flirting stuff than I thought.

298
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
What?

299
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
I don't get it, but she wanted meto give you her number.

300
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
And she just gave you this?

301
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
Rach, thanks. But I don't needyou doing me any favors.

302
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
I didn't.She thought you were cute.

303
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Well, that I can believe.

304
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
Hey, is the show still on?
