116

I cannot believe he's using[br]our divorce to sell mattresses!

117



118

00:02:39.92,00:02:43.76

119

I know. At $499 for a pillow-top[br]queen, who cares about the divorce?

120



121

00:02:44.00,00:02:46.31

122

Those babies will sell themselves!

123



124

00:02:48.40,00:02:51.04

125

And I' m appalled for you, by the way.

I'm close! I'm cheap! I'm the King!

Oh, shoot![br]Tomorrow's not good.

143

I' m supposed to fall off[br]the Empire State Building. . .

145

00:03:16.16,00:03:18.60

146

. . .and land on a bicycle[br]with no seat, so. . . .

147



148

00:03:21.20,00:03:23.16

149

My father doesn't hate you.

150



151

00:03:23.40,00:03:26.04

152

Please. He refers to me[br]as "Wet-Head. "

153



154

00:03:27.28,00:03:29.72

155

Honey, he calls everybody[br]by a nickname.

156



157

00:03:29.96,00:03:32.96

158

I know. Just one dinner.[br]One night. For me. Please?

159



160

00:03:33.20,00:03:35.96

161

I just want him to love you like I do.

162



163

00:03:36.56,00:03:38.76

164

All right. Well, not exactly[br]like I do.

165



166

00:03:39.72,00:03:41.56

167

But if you do come to dinner. . .

168



169

00:03:41.80,00:03:44.92

170

. . .I'll love you like I do[br]in that black thing that you like.

171



172

00:03:45.68,00:03:46.64

173

I'll go.

174



175

00:03:50.52,00:03:51.32

176

Fine.

177



178

00:03:51.56,00:03:53.00

179

Thank you.

180



181

00:03:56.72,00:03:57.76

Hi, Gunther.

183



184

00:03:58.00,00:03:59.92

185

Yeah. We'll see.

186



187

00:04:02.20,00:04:03.35

188

Hey, you guys!

189



190

00:04:03.80,00:04:04.79

191

Guess what.

192



193

00:04:05.36,00:04:06.80

194

-I got a gig![br]-Great!

195



196

00:04:07.20,00:04:10.32

197

That's why I can never be an actor.[br]I can't say "gig. "

198



199

00:04:10.56,00:04:13.52

200

I can't say "croissant. "[br]Oh, my God!

201



202

00:04:15.08,00:04:17.04

203

-What's the part?[br]-It's not a part.

204



205

00:04:17.28,00:04:20.12

206

I' m teaching Acting for Soap Operas[br]at the Learning Extension.

207



208

00:04:20.32,00:04:21.64

209

Come on! That's great!

210



211

00:04:21.88,00:04:24.11

212

It's my chance to give[br]something back. . .

213



214

00:04:24.36,00:04:26.51

215

. . .to the acting community.

216



217

00:04:26.84,00:04:29.84

218

You' re probably not allowed to sleep[br]with your students.

219



220

00:04:34.68,00:04:35.51

221

I know.

222



223

00:04:41.60,00:04:44.12

224

I don't know, Monica.[br]It feels funny just being here.

225



226

00:04:44.40,00:04:46.92

227

If you buy a bed from[br]Janice's ex-husband. . .

228



229

00:04:47.16,00:04:48.80

230

. . .it's like betraying Chandler.

231



232

00:04:49.00,00:04:50.64

233

Not at these prices!

234



235

00:04:57.16,00:05:00.71

236

You know, in England this car would be[br]on the other side of the store.

237



238

00:05:11.88,00:05:12.92

239

Come here.

240



241

00:05:13.96,00:05:14.95

242

This is my new bed!

243



244

00:05:15.20,00:05:17.35

245

You gotta feel this bad boy!

246



247

00:05:18.00,00:05:20.92

248

Monica, it still feels so weird,[br]you know?

249



250

00:05:21.16,00:05:22.52

251

Chandler's your friend.

252



253

00:05:23.60,00:05:25.16

254

Oh, my God!

255



256

00:05:27.00,00:05:30.12

257

All right, take this bed.[br]You can make other friends.

258



259

00:05:38.56,00:05:39.47

260

Good evening.

261



262

00:05:40.20,00:05:41.88

263

I am Mr. Tribbiani.

264



265

00:05:43.92,00:05:46.44

266

And I will be teaching[br]Acting for Soap Operas.

267



268

00:05:46.88,00:05:47.84

269

Now. . .

270



271

00:05:48.72,00:05:53.40

272

. . .on my first day as Dr. Drake[br]Ramoray on Days Of Our Lives...

273



274

00:05:56.88,00:06:01.04

275

. . .I learned one of the most important[br]things in soap opera acting. . .

276



277

00:06:01.28,00:06:02.48

278

. . .is reacting.

279



280

00:06:02.80,00:06:05.11

281

This does not mean acting again.

282



283

00:06:06.68,00:06:09.56

284

It means you don't have a line,[br]but someone else just did.

285



286

00:06:09.80,00:06:11.72

287

And it goes something like this.

288



289

00:06:18.92,00:06:20.20

290

Thanks. Thanks a lot.

291



292

00:06:20.44,00:06:22.96

293

By the way, before I forget.[br]To work in soap operas. . .

294



295

00:06:23.20,00:06:25.59

296

. . .some of you will have to[br]become more attractive.

297



298

00:06:27.44,00:06:29.24

299

All right, moving right along. . . .

300



301

00:06:34.52,00:06:38.12

302

-How was teaching last night?[br]-Great! You get to say stuff like. . .

303



304

00:06:38.32,00:06:42.68

305

. . . "Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you.[br]I dismiss you. "

306



307

00:06:43.88,00:06:45.11

308

Oh, nice.

309



310

00:06:45.32,00:06:47.79

311

Oh, and I got an audition[br]for All My Children!

312



313

00:06:48.64,00:06:49.92

314

It's this great part.

315



316

00:06:50.12,00:06:51.40

317

This boxer named Nick.

318



319

00:06:51.60,00:06:54.24

320

And I' m so, so right for it.[br]He's just like me.

321



322

00:06:54.48,00:06:56.16

323

Except that he's a boxer. . .

324



325

00:06:56.40,00:06:58.00

326

. . .and has an evil twin.

327



328

00:07:04.72,00:07:07.88

329

Hear ye, hear ye![br]Delivery from the Mattress King!

330



331

00:07:10.44,00:07:11.64

332

You Miss Geller?

333



334

00:07:12.56,00:07:13.68

335

Sign here.

336



337

00:07:15.20,00:07:16.76

338

Do I have a middle name?

339



340

00:07:17.00,00:07:19.72

341

All right. Monica "Felula" . . .

342



343

00:07:20.72,00:07:21.71

344

. . .Geller.

345



346

00:07:22.00,00:07:23.48

347

It's that bedroom there.

348



349

00:07:27.00,00:07:29.44

350

Monica bought a bed[br]from the Mattress King?

351



352

00:07:29.68,00:07:32.84

353

Please, please, please[br]don't say anything to Chandler.

354



355

00:07:33.32,00:07:35.68

356

-You want me to lie to him?[br]-Is that a problem?

357



358

00:07:38.20,00:07:40.92

359

Oh, hey, "Nick the boxer. "[br]Let's see what you got!

360



361

00:07:41.16,00:07:42.72

362

All right, put them up.

363



364

00:07:42.92,00:07:45.12

365

Hey, you' re pretty good at this.

366



367

00:07:45.32,00:07:47.44

368

I had to learn.[br]I was staying at the "Y" . . .

369



370

00:07:47.68,00:07:50.72

371

. . .and some of the young men[br]weren't acting Christian enough.

372



373

00:07:53.28,00:07:54.16

374

Hey, now!

375



376

00:07:56.60,00:07:58.36

377

And I' m bleeding.[br]Okay, great.

378



379

00:07:58.56,00:08:00.92

380

Wow! And I' m a vegetarian!

381



382

00:08:02.52,00:08:04.56

383

I' m sorry.[br]We'll put some ice on it.

384



385

00:08:04.80,00:08:06.44

386

Put your head back.

387



388

00:08:06.68,00:08:08.16

389

-I can't see.[br]-I have you.

390



391

00:08:08.40,00:08:09.60

392

Oh, God!

393



394

00:08:11.08,00:08:13.55

395

Which bedroom do you want it in,[br]Ms. Geller?

396



397

00:08:13.80,00:08:16.44

398

It's the compulsively neat one[br]by the window.

399



400

00:08:16.68,00:08:17.91

401

Gotcha.

402



403

00:08:25.00,00:08:26.07

404

Hi, Daddy!

405



406

00:08:26.96,00:08:28.32

407

This is where they put us?

408



409

00:08:28.56,00:08:31.52

410

What? There was no table[br]in the kitchen?

411



412

00:08:32.56,00:08:34.71

413

-Hello, baby.[br]-You remember Ross.

414



415

00:08:34.92,00:08:36.84

416

Nice to see you again, Dr. Greene.

417



418

00:08:37.08,00:08:38.15

423



424

00:08:46.88,00:08:49.96

425

-What happened to the library?[br]-There never was a library.

426



427

00:08:50.20,00:08:52.72

428

I mean, there are libraries.[br]It's just. . .

429



430

00:08:52.96,00:08:54.92

431

. . .that I've never worked at one.

432



433

00:08:58.36,00:09:01.28

434

You know what's really good here?[br]The lobster.

435



436

00:09:01.60,00:09:04.40

437

-Shall I just order three?[br]-If you' re really hungry.

438



439

00:09:10.08,00:09:12.00

440

It was a joke. I made a joke.

441



442

00:09:13.28,00:09:15.92

443

Actually, Daddy,[br]Ross is allergic to lobster.

444



445

00:09:16.12,00:09:19.88

446

Who's allergic to lobster? I guess[br]someone that works in a library.

447



448

00:09:20.64,00:09:22.12

449

-It's--[br]-I know. It's a museum!

450



451

00:09:22.36,00:09:25.75

452

You' re the only who can make a joke?[br]At least mine was funny.

453



454

00:09:26.00,00:09:26.80

455

Waiter.

456



457

00:09:27.20,00:09:30.08

458

We will have two lobsters[br]and a menu.

459



460

00:09:34.00,00:09:36.44

461

So, Dr. Greene, how's the old boat?

462



463

00:09:36.68,00:09:39.99

464

They found rust. Do you know[br]what rust does to a boat?

465



466

00:09:40.48,00:09:42.36

467

Gives it a nice antique-y look?

468



469

00:09:47.20,00:09:50.32

470

Rust is boat cancer, Ross.

471



472

00:09:50.76,00:09:52.20

473

Wow, I' m sorry.

474



475

00:09:52.44,00:09:54.64

476

When I was a kid,[br]I lost a bike to that.

477



478

00:10:00.60,00:10:01.83

479

Excuse me for a moment.

480



481

00:10:02.08,00:10:04.52

482

I want to say good night[br]to the Levines before we go.

483



484

00:10:09.20,00:10:11.20

485

Honey, stop. It's not that bad.

486



487

00:10:14.36,00:10:17.56

488

Your dad must have added wrong.[br]He only tipped 4%%% .

489



490

00:10:17.80,00:10:19.56

491

Yeah. That's Daddy.

492



493

00:10:20.00,00:10:24.12

494

"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it[br]bother you? You' re a waitress.

495



496

00:10:24.32,00:10:25.76

497

Yes, it bothers me.

498



499

00:10:26.00,00:10:29.96

500

If he was a regular at the coffee[br]house, I'd be serving him sneezers.

501



502

00:10:31.00,00:10:32.56

503

-So?[br]-So, Ross. . .

504



505

00:10:32.80,00:10:36.43

506

. . .I've bugged him about this[br]a million times. He won't change.

507



508

00:10:36.68,00:10:39.32

509

Do you really serve people sneezers?

510



511

00:10:40.12,00:10:41.72

512

Well, I don't.

513



514

00:10:42.88,00:10:44.24

515

All right, kids. Ready?

516



517

00:10:44.68,00:10:46.91

518

Thanks again, Dr. Greene.

519



520

00:10:52.16,00:10:54.63

521

Wait, I think I forgot my receipt.

522



523

00:10:54.88,00:10:56.52

524

-You don't need that.[br]-Why not?

525



526

00:10:56.72,00:11:00.88

527

The carbon. It's messy. I mean,[br]gets on your fingers and causes. . .

528



529

00:11:01.12,00:11:02.44

530

. . .night blindness.

531



532

00:11:05.68,00:11:06.64

533

What is this?

534



535

00:11:07.56,00:11:09.08

536

Who put a 20 down here?

537



538

00:11:09.68,00:11:11.64

539

Oh, yeah, that would be me.

540



541

00:11:12.40,00:11:13.84

542

I have a problem.

543



544

00:11:14.08,00:11:15.92

545

I tip way too much.[br]Way too much.

546



547

00:11:16.12,00:11:18.12

548

-It's a sickness, really.[br]-Yeah, it is.

549



550

00:11:18.36,00:11:21.16

551

-We have to do something about that.[br]-Excuse me.

552



553

00:11:21.48,00:11:23.32

554

You think I' m cheap?

555



556

00:11:23.60,00:11:26.52

557

He didn't mean anything by that.[br]He really didn't.

558



559

00:11:26.76,00:11:29.32

560

Nothing I do means anything. Really.

561



562

00:11:31.40,00:11:33.55

563

This is nice.[br]I pay $200 for dinner.

564



565

00:11:33.80,00:11:37.11

566

You put down $20 and you come out[br]looking like Mr. Big Shot.

567



568

00:11:37.32,00:11:39.52

569

You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?[br]Here.

570



571

00:11:39.76,00:11:43.72

572

I'll tell you what. You pay the[br]whole bill, Mr. Big Shot. All right?

573



574

00:11:46.20,00:11:49.51

575

Well, "Mr. Big Shot" is better[br]than "Wet-Head. "

576



577

00:11:51.00,00:11:53.15

578

Okay, some tricks of the trade.

579



580

00:11:53.40,00:11:56.12

581

Now, I've never been able to cry[br]as an actor. . .

582



583

00:11:56.36,00:11:58.24

584

. . .so if I have to cry. . .

585



586

00:11:58.48,00:12:00.24

587

. . .I cut a hole in my pocket. . .

588



589

00:12:00.48,00:12:02.32

590

. . .take a pair of tweezers. . .

591



592

00:12:03.00,00:12:04.80

593

. . .and just start pulling.

594



595

00:12:07.72,00:12:10.24

596

Or let's say I want to convey. . .

597



598

00:12:10.48,00:12:13.12

599

. . .that I've just done[br]something evil.

600



601

00:12:13.32,00:12:17.20

602

That would be your basic I've-got-a-[br]fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-l-like-it.

603



604

00:12:22.48,00:12:24.52

605

Let's say I've just gotten bad news.

606



607

00:12:24.76,00:12:29.16

608

Well, all I do there[br]is try and divide 232 by 1 3.

609



610

00:12:38.36,00:12:39.72

611

And that's how it's done.

612



613

00:12:39.92,00:12:42.12

614

Great soap opera acting[br]tonight, everybody.

615



616

00:12:42.32,00:12:43.60

617

Class dismissed.

618



619

00:12:46.00,00:12:47.28

620

Hey, Mr. Trib.

621



622

00:12:47.68,00:12:49.72

623

Guess what? I got an audition!

624



625

00:12:50.72,00:12:53.19

626

One of my students got an audition.[br]I' m so proud!

627



628

00:12:54.72,00:12:57.08

629

I was wondering if you'd[br]coach me for it.

630



631

00:12:57.32,00:12:58.92

632

You bet! What's the part?

633



634

00:12:59.12,00:12:59.95

635

Oh, it's great!

636



637

00:13:00.20,00:13:02.88

638

It's a role on All My Children.[br]Nick the boxer.

639



640

00:13:11.92,00:13:13.76

641

You couldn't leave it alone.

642



643

00:13:14.00,00:13:18.32

644

Four percent, okay? I tip more than[br]that when there's a bug in my food.

645



646

00:13:18.76,00:13:21.48

647

Tonight was about the two of you[br]getting along.

648



649

00:13:22.20,00:13:24.32

650

Would you just see[br]my chiropractor already?

651



652

00:13:24.56,00:13:28.32

653

I' m gonna go to a doctor who went[br]to medical school in a mini-mall.

654



655

00:13:32.60,00:13:34.52

656

Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?

657



658

00:13:34.72,00:13:36.68

659

I' m freaking out!

660



661

00:13:39.40,00:13:42.71

662

Monica trusted me with something[br]and she shouldn't have!

663



664

00:13:43.20,00:13:45.96

665

I haven't lived here in a while,[br]so I have to ask you.

666



667

00:13:46.20,00:13:48.48

668

Does Monica still turn the lights on[br]in her room?

669



670

00:13:51.56,00:13:52.44

671

I am so dead!

672



673

00:13:54.96,00:13:56.72

674

Look, here's the bottom line.

675



676

00:13:56.92,00:13:59.36

677

This is fixable if we act fast, okay?

678



679

00:13:59.60,00:14:02.24

680

I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow,[br]and you can make nice.

681



682

00:14:02.44,00:14:05.52

683

Honey, I have tried to make nice.[br]It doesn't work.

684



685

00:14:05.72,00:14:07.72

686

Look, I realize my father[br]is difficult.

687



688

00:14:07.96,00:14:11.35

689

But that's why you have got to be[br]the bigger man here.

690



691

00:14:11.60,00:14:15.12

692

Sweetie, I could be the bigger man.[br]I could be the biggest man.

693



694

00:14:15.32,00:14:18.84

695

I could be a huge, giant man, and[br]it still wouldn't make a difference.

696



697

00:14:19.08,00:14:23.24

698

Except I could pick your father up and[br]say, "Like me! Like me, tiny doctor! "

699



700

00:14:25.00,00:14:28.31

701

Can't you just try it one more time?[br]For me? For me?

702



703

00:14:28.52,00:14:30.96

704

One brunch is not gonna[br]solve anything.

705



706

00:14:31.20,00:14:33.32

707

Face it.[br]We' re never gonna get along.

708



709

00:14:33.56,00:14:35.76

710

Well, you are just going to have to.

711



712

00:14:36.00,00:14:39.36

713

I've already got a mother and father[br]who cannot stay in the same room.

714



715

00:14:39.60,00:14:42.32

716

I don't want to have a separate room[br]for you too!

717



718

00:14:44.16,00:14:45.64

719

I'll get the bagels.

720



721

00:14:50.60,00:14:51.83

722

What's this?

723



724

00:14:52.92,00:14:54.52

725

Isn't it cool?

726



727

00:14:57.16,00:14:58.96

728

This is not the bed I ordered.

729



730

00:14:59.20,00:15:02.12

731

I know! You must have won[br]a contest or something.

732



733

00:15:05.92,00:15:07.56

734

Why is this car in my bedroom?

735



736

00:15:07.80,00:15:09.64

737

I' m sorry. I wasn't looking. . .

738



739

00:15:09.84,00:15:12.88

740

. . .and the store won't take[br]it back, because you signed for it.

741



742

00:15:13.16,00:15:15.55

743

-When did I sign for it?[br]-When I was you.

744



745

00:15:15.80,00:15:18.56

746

It's all Joey's fault,[br]because he left his nose open!

747



748

00:15:20.88,00:15:22.40

749

Did you make brownies today?

750



751

00:15:23.80,00:15:24.71

752

Knock, knock!

753



754

00:15:24.96,00:15:28.12

755

Quick! Take off your dress.[br]He won't notice the bed.

756



757

00:15:29.80,00:15:32.72

758

I' m going for sushi.[br]Does anybody want--?

759



760

00:15:34.52,00:15:36.64

761

Somebody missed the off-ramp!

762



763

00:15:39.28,00:15:41.00

764

It's Monica's bed. What?

765



766

00:15:43.92,00:15:45.64

767

It's a racecar!

768



769

00:15:46.72,00:15:49.36

770

This has always been Monica's bed.[br]You just noticed?

771



772

00:15:49.60,00:15:51.40

773

How self-involved are you?

774



775

00:15:53.56,00:15:57.56

776

If this bed isn't new, then how come[br]there's plastic on the mattress?

777



778

00:15:59.88,00:16:01.48

779

Sometimes I have bad dreams.

780



781

00:16:05.52,00:16:06.43

782

Look. . .

783



784

00:16:06.96,00:16:10.96

785

. . .I just saw my best friend's[br]brain smeared across the canvas.

786



787

00:16:11.32,00:16:13.04

788

It's not gonna be me.

789



790

00:16:13.52,00:16:14.35

791

Not me.

792



793

00:16:18.60,00:16:19.96

794

That was good.

795



796

00:16:20.20,00:16:21.00

797

That was--

798



799

00:16:21.88,00:16:22.92

800

Tweezers?

801



802

00:16:26.20,00:16:28.24

803

-That was really good.[br]-Thanks.

804



805

00:16:29.40,00:16:30.44

806

Any suggestions?

807



808

00:16:37.24,00:16:39.68

809

You told him to play the boxer gay?

810



811

00:16:43.72,00:16:45.36

812

I might have said. . .

813



814

00:16:45.60,00:16:46.96

815

. . . "super-gay. "

816



817

00:16:48.36,00:16:50.20

818

You totally screwed him over.

819



820

00:16:50.40,00:16:53.12

821

You' re this guy's teacher.[br]How could you do this?

822



823

00:16:53.32,00:16:55.16

824

Because the guy's so good.

825



826

00:16:55.40,00:16:57.76

827

And I really, really want this part.

828



829

00:16:58.00,00:17:00.84

830

Well, if you really, really want it,[br]then it's okay.

831



832

00:17:03.20,00:17:04.88

833

-Hi, Daddy.[br]-Baby.

834



835

00:17:08.00,00:17:09.92

836

Dr. Greene, how are you?

837



838

00:17:12.48,00:17:14.16

839

Thanks for dinner last night.

840



841

00:17:14.40,00:17:17.00

842

Thank you for teaching me[br]a valuable lesson.

843



844

00:17:17.56,00:17:19.63

845

Nice hair. What did you do, swim here?

846



847

00:17:23.36,00:17:25.51

848

That's it.[br]I can't take it anymore.

849



850

00:17:25.72,00:17:30.12

851

What? He likes your hair and just[br]wants to know how you got here.

852



853

00:17:31.12,00:17:34.20

854

-It's hopeless. I' m just gonna go.[br]-What?

855



856

00:17:34.44,00:17:36.32

857

-I' m sorry. It's just--[br]-Ross?

858



859

00:17:36.72,00:17:38.00

860

What's with the neck?

861



862

00:17:38.20,00:17:40.92

863

I keep telling him[br]to go to my chiropractor.

864



865

00:17:41.12,00:17:42.84

866

You still going to him?

867



868

00:17:43.08,00:17:45.36

869

He couldn't get into[br]med school in lxtapa!

870



871

00:17:46.20,00:17:48.67

872

Thank you.[br]That's what I keep saying.

873



874

00:17:48.88,00:17:52.35

875

Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens[br]to be an excellent doctor.

876



877

00:17:52.60,00:17:55.68

878

Wait a minute.[br]His name is Dr. Bobby?

879



880

00:17:56.84,00:17:59.04

881

-That's his last name.[br]-And his first name.

882



883

00:17:59.24,00:18:00.88

884

He's Bobby Bobby?

885



886

00:18:02.92,00:18:04.56

887

It's Robert Bobby.

888



889

00:18:06.12,00:18:08.96

890

And excuse me. He helps me.

891



892

00:18:09.16,00:18:11.80

893

-Please. Ask her how?[br]-What do you need help for?

894



895

00:18:12.00,00:18:14.15

896

My alignment.[br]One leg's shorter than the other.

897



898

00:18:14.36,00:18:16.32

899

-Oh, my God.[br]-Argue with that.

900



901

00:18:16.52,00:18:18.72

902

My right leg is two inches shorter!

903



904

00:18:18.96,00:18:20.96

905

Come on, you' re just tilting!

906



907

00:18:22.20,00:18:24.12

908

-Her legs are fine.[br]-I know that.

909



910

00:18:24.32,00:18:27.00

911

-So why do you let her go to him?[br]-"Let her"?

912



913

00:18:27.24,00:18:30.55

914

She doesn't listen to me[br]about renter's insurance, either.

915



916

00:18:30.80,00:18:33.52

917

Wait a minute. You don't have[br]renter's insurance?

918



919

00:18:37.52,00:18:42.12

920

How you gonna run after a thief,[br]with one leg shorter than the other?

921



922

00:18:47.52,00:18:51.04

923

-Would you like some juice?[br]-I'd love some juice.

924



925

00:18:52.80,00:18:55.64

926

This is going so well![br]Did you see us? Did you see?

927



928

00:18:55.88,00:18:58.11

929

Yeah, honey. I was standing[br]right there.

930



931

00:18:58.68,00:19:00.75

932

Why don't you tell him about[br]my mole?

933



934

00:19:01.16,00:19:02.07

935

Excellent!

936



937

00:19:06.60,00:19:09.16

938

There will come a time[br]in each of your careers. . .

939



940

00:19:09.40,00:19:13.32

941

. . .when you'll have a chance to screw[br]over another soap opera actor.

942



943

00:19:14.00,00:19:17.08

944

I had such an opportunity[br]in the recent present.

945



946

00:19:19.52,00:19:21.52

947

And I' m ashamed to say. . .

948



949

00:19:22.00,00:19:23.15

950

. . .that I took it.

951



952

00:19:24.68,00:19:28.20

953

I advised a fellow actor[br]to play a role. . .

954



955

00:19:29.68,00:19:31.12

956

. . .homosexually.

957



958

00:19:36.36,00:19:39.28

959

We both auditioned for the part. . .

960



961

00:19:40.72,00:19:42.40

962

. . .and as it turned out. . .

963



964

00:19:43.32,00:19:44.28

965

. . .they. . . .

966



967

00:19:46.00,00:19:48.92

968

They liked the stupid "gay" thing[br]and cast him.

969



970

00:19:51.48,00:19:52.92

971

And now. . .

972



973

00:19:53.20,00:19:56.08

974

. . .he's got a two-year contract. . .

975



976

00:19:57.40,00:19:59.08

977

. . .opposite Susan Lucci. . .

978



979

00:19:59.56,00:20:02.40

980

. . .the first lady[br]of daytime television.

981



982

00:20:03.48,00:20:04.44

983

And me?

984



985

00:20:05.32,00:20:08.84

986

Me, I' m stuck here teaching[br]a bunch of people. . .

987



988

00:20:09.08,00:20:12.24

989

. . .most of whom are too ugly[br]to even be on Tv.

990



991

00:20:14.96,00:20:17.03

992

I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

993



994

00:20:26.56,00:20:27.55

995

Thank you.

996



997

00:20:31.84,00:20:33.20

998

-May I help you?[br]-Yes, hi.

999



1000

00:20:33.44,00:20:36.08

1001

I' m the lady who got stuck[br]with the racecar bed.

1002



1003

00:20:36.32,00:20:40.36

1004

Look, it's like I told you.[br]There's nothing I can do.

1005



1006

00:20:40.60,00:20:44.28

1007

You signed for it.[br]"Monica Felula Geller. "

1008



1009

00:20:45.48,00:20:47.52

1010

All right, we wanna see the King.

1011



1012

00:20:47.72,00:20:49.56

1013

Nobody sees the King.

1014



1015

00:20:50.52,00:20:52.52

1016

Okay. I' m talking to the King.

1017



1018

00:20:52.72,00:20:54.60

1019

Hey, you can't go back there!

1020



1021

00:21:00.12,00:21:03.24

1022

Oh, my God.

1023



1024

00:21:17.60,00:21:19.52

1025

Hey, watch it, lady!

1026



1027

00:21:25.48,00:21:27.36

1028

Hey, good-looking.

1029



1030

00:21:37.00,00:21:38.52

1031

All right, I'll leave.

1032



1033

00:21:39.12,00:21:40.80

1034

My bed's so boring.

1035
