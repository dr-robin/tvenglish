1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
Come on, Joey!

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
I told you everything I knewlast night.

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
It's not that big a deal.So they're doing it.

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
I cannot believe you would say that!

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:14
Sorry. Monica and Chandlerare making love.

6
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
No, I mean, come on.This is a huge deal!

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
I need more details.Who initiated the first kiss?

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
I don't know.

9
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
Is he romantic with her?

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
I don't know.

11
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
Are they in love?

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
I don't know.

13
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
You don't know anything.

14
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
I know one thing.

15
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
They did it right there.

16
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
The One with Chandler's Work Laugh

17
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
Could I have a scone?

18
00:01:20 --> 00:01:21
Want to hear some good news?

19
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
Someone I know is getting married.

20
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
Weddings are happy occasions.Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily!

21
00:01:28 --> 00:01:29
Sorry, man.

22
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
- Here's your scone.- Thanks.

23
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
Stupid British snack food!

24
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
Did they teach you thatin anger management?

25
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
You know what mighthelp you deal with it?

26
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
You two are in the past.You can't be mad about the past.

27
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
Are you still mad about, you know,the Louisiana Purchase?

28
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
Nobody's mad about that.

29
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
Exactly!Because it's in the past.

30
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
Anybody going to eat that?

31
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
Look at us all dressed up for the party.What are we celebrating?

32
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
We had a lot of liquorleft over from Christmas.

33
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
Our friends aren't here. We can bea real couple. We don't have to hide.

34
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
I know. I can do this.

35
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
And I can do this.

36
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
We can't do that.

37
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
Hey, Bing!

38
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
Who's the pretty lady,and what is she doing with you?

39
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
I asked myselfthat very question, sir.

40
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
My boss, Doug.

41
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
- This is Monica.- Hi.

42
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
- This is my wife, Kara.- Nice to meet you.

43
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Did you hear about the new law firmworking for us?

44
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.

45
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
Let's go drink our body weight.

46
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
What was that?

47
00:02:45 --> 00:02:46
That noise you made?

48
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
Oh, my work laugh.

49
00:02:48 --> 00:02:48
Your work laugh?

50
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
If you're going to survive this party,come up with one too.

51
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
All right. Check me out.

52
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
He says, "$30, Father.Same as in town."

53
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
Everybody at work loved you last night.

54
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
And they like me morejust because I was with you.

55
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
You repaired the damagefrom when they met Joey.

56
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
Doug wants to play tennis.He never talks to me outside of work.

57
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
Except for that timeat that strip club.

58
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
Strip church.

59
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
- I'll go find a racket.- I thought you had one.

60
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
I used to, but then Joey thoughtit'd be fun to go hit rocks...

61
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
...at bigger rocks.

62
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
Do you have a tennis racket?

63
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
I lent it to Joey andI've never gotten it back.

64
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
Good luck with that.

65
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
What's up?

66
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
Why are you here?I thought you had inventory.

67
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
I do, but I decided I'd takea long lunch...

68
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
...and spend some timewith my friend, Monica.

69
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
You know, I feel likewe don't talk anymore.

70
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
How are you?

71
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
What is new with you?

72
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Not much. Work's good.

73
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
We don't have to talk about work.Talk about anything.

74
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
You know what?

75
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
Let's talk about relationships.

76
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
What's going on?

77
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
Nothing.

78
00:04:09 --> 00:04:10
You go.

79
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
There was this guy at the bankthat I thought was cute.

80
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
But I don't anymore.

81
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
That's juicy.

82
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
You know what? I actually dohave a lot of work to do.

83
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
You're sure there's justnot anything else?

84
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
I'm sure. Is there somethingyou want to talk to me about?

85
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
No!

86
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.

87
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
Then what happened?

88
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
You'll get your turn.

89
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
- Hey, Pheebs. What's going on?- Nothing.

90
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
This is not over.

91
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
No, no, no!

92
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
I was up all night writingthis nasty letter to Emily.

93
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
It was perfect,and now it's all covered in...

94
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
Actually, thanks!

95
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
All right!Ready to go to the movies?

96
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
Actually, I think I'll skip it.

97
00:05:05 --> 00:05:05
Really?

98
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
I'll read my book.I just want to be alone right now.

99
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
Sure you don't want to?

100
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.They get mail and stuff.

101
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
That's okay, Joe.

102
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
Let's go, Pheebs.

103
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Game!

104
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
I got to tell you, that partnerof yours is a real tiger.

105
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
Are you all right?

106
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
We'll just geta little sip of water.

107
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Am I on fire today or what?

108
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
Those birds are browned,basted and ready to be carved.

109
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
Okay, easy, Martina.

110
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
I think we should let themwin the next game.

111
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
I'm sorry, I don't understandwhat you just said.

112
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
Let them win one.

113
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
Are you crazy? We own those two.Look at them!

114
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
He can't even breathe,and she's popping pills.

115
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
You're not giving them a chance.

116
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
They have rackets.

117
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
We'll make this the last game.

118
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

119
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
Are you sure you never played pro?

120
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
Please let them win.

121
00:06:17 --> 00:06:22
I'll take it down to 95%,but that's the best I can do.

122
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
- Missed it!- I got it!

123
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
Nice shot.

124
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
I got it!

125
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
Long!

126
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
I can't believe you let them win.

127
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
Well, at least you hidyour feelings well about it.

128
00:06:51 --> 00:06:52
I was frustrated.

129
00:06:52 --> 00:06:53
It's my racket.

130
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Frustrated with you!

131
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
If we hadn't lost, they would never haveinvited us to dinner tomorrow.

132
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
What bothers me...

133
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
...is how differentyou act around them.

134
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
The throwing the tennis games,the fake laugh...

135
00:07:04 --> 00:07:08
...the "See you later, Bing!""Not if I see you first, Doug!"

136
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
I don't like "work Chandler".The guy's a suck-up.

137
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
Because you said that...

138
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
...I'm not putting out tonight!

139
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
Something's wrong.My brother doesn't stay out all night.

140
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
Maybe we should checkthe trash chute.

141
00:07:27 --> 00:07:28
Ross couldn't fitdown the trash chute.

142
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
That's right. He almost could.

143
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
Which is exactlyhow I got stuck there.

144
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
Oh, my God!

145
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Where the hell have you been?

146
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Just, you know, out.

147
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
Oh, out! God, I don't knowwhy we didn't think to check there.

148
00:07:45 --> 00:07:46
What were you doing?

149
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
I went to a bar and then...

150
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
...I just walked around for a while.

151
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
You walked around all nightin the city by yourself?

152
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
He hooked up!

153
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
He hooked up.

154
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
I don't have to answer your questions.I'm a big boy.

155
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
I can do what I want.

156
00:08:03 --> 00:08:05
He hooked up!

157
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Tell us about her!

158
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
Ross, you left your scarf...

159
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
Hey, you guys.

160
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
I know what you all are thinking,but Chandler is in Yemen.

161
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
I'm a young woman. I have needs.I can't wait forever.

162
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

163
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
So I'm asking you, pleasejust take a moment before you judge me.

164
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
Nobody's judging you.

165
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

166
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
...call me.

167
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
I know what you guys are going to say.

168
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
You two would havevery hairy children.

169
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
I didn't know you'd say that.

170
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
Ross! Janice?

171
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
All right. Hold on, hold on.

172
00:09:06 --> 00:09:07
This is Ross.

173
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
He's our friend.He obviously went crazy.

174
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
He obviously lost his mind.

175
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
I didn't lose my mind, okay?Janice and I have a lot in common.

176
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
We've both been divorced.We both have kids.

177
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
Are you going to see her again?

178
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
- Don't put ideas in his head!- I will see her.

179
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
Damn it, Phoebe!

180
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
I have to tell you somethingthat I've never admitted.

181
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
In high school, I made out with Jameseven though I knew you liked him.

182
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
That feels so good to get off my chest.Okay, you go.

183
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
My turn? What are you talking about?

184
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
I know about you and Chandler.

185
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
I overheard youon the phone the other day.

186
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doinglaundry for a couple of hours."

187
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
And he said, "Laundry?Is that my new nickname?"

188
00:09:54 --> 00:09:55
And you said:

189
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
"You know whatyour nickname is, Mr. Big."

190
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
You're writing yourselfa little play there, Rach.

191
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
Let me know how it turns out.

192
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
I wouldn't know because I gotso freaked out I hung up the phone.

193
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
Well, if you had kept listening...

194
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
...you would have heard mecall him Mister...

195
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
...Bigot.

196
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
Mr. Bigot.

197
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
He tells the most racist jokes.

198
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
All right. So that's it.

199
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
There's nothing going onbetween you and Chandler?

200
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
Me and Chandler?

201
00:10:37 --> 00:10:38
Put your $20 down.

202
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
First one to findthe tasty treat wins, okay?

203
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
All right, let's get the contestantsout of their isolation booths.

204
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
And they're off!

205
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
Get your foot off my contestant!Judge?

206
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
Judge rules no violation.

207
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
It's so weird to say this,but I just had a great date with Janice.

208
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
- What?- Are you serious?

209
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
I opened up to her about allthe stuff that's been happening to me.

210
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
I mean, I talked for hours.

211
00:11:06 --> 00:11:07
It is amazing...

212
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
...to have someone give yousuch focused attention.

213
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
You don't need Janice for that.You've got us.

214
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!

215
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
That's not a Nutter Butter.That's an old won ton!

216
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
Judge rules...

217
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
...Nutter Butter.

218
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
Tough call.

219
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
Seriously, I strongly believe thatwe should support President Clinton...

220
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
...and her husband, Bill.

221
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
How do you like your coffee?

222
00:11:35 --> 00:11:36
- None for me.- A little sugar.

223
00:11:37 --> 00:11:41
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.That will sweeten it up.

224
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
- That laugh doesn't give you a headache?- You get used to it.

225
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
I don't think that I can.

226
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
This will be it for meon the work things.

227
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
I laugh at my boss's jokes.What's the big deal?

228
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
I'd rather not be withthis work-weasel guy...

229
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
...when I can be with my boyfriend,who I actually respect.

230
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.I'd feel sorry for it in a fight.

231
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
It's not strong enoughto defend itself.

232
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
Hear what I said?

233
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
What?

234
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
It's a joke.What's the matter with you?

235
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
Well, I just didn't thinkit was funny, sir.

236
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
Excuse me?

237
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
- Well, I just...- Honey?

238
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
I just don't thinkyou understood the joke.

239
00:12:24 --> 00:12:24
Really?

240
00:12:24 --> 00:12:28
I mean, it was really funny.I just don't think that you got it.

241
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
You see, Kara's coffeeis weak-tasting.

242
00:12:31 --> 00:12:35
But what Doug did was implythat it was weak physically.

243
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
- You get it now, honey?- I think I do!

244
00:12:41 --> 00:12:45
- Thank you, Monica.- I thought you could use the help.

245
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
Coffee in a fight!

246
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
You mind if I readmy comic books in here?

247
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
Sure. Why?

248
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
Chandler and Monica are over there.It's kind of hard to concentrate.

249
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
She just called and saidshe was going to be working late.

250
00:13:04 --> 00:13:05
She keeps lying to me.

251
00:13:05 --> 00:13:10
That's it! I'm going over thereand confronting them right now.

252
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
All right, so you're telling methat I have to tell racist jokes now?

253
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
I'm just not very good at this.

254
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
I'm a terrible liar.I hate having to lie to Rachel.

255
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
- But we're not ready to tell yet.- I know.

256
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
Ever since high school, Rachel was theone person that I told everything to.

257
00:13:32 --> 00:13:33
I miss that so much now.

258
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
She's my best friend.

259
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
Oh, my God, Rachel!

260
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
What are you doing here?

261
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
Well, I actually came over hereto borrow this lamp...

262
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
...to look at my books.

263
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
You know, see them a little better.

264
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
Okay, great.

265
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
Well, what I was doingin Chandler's room is that...

266
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
...I was cleaning it.

267
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
He pays me to clean it.

268
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
What a great way to makesome extra pocket money.

269
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
When I said to you earlierthat I was at work...

270
00:14:15 --> 00:14:16
...I'm at my new work.

271
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
Good enough. Right?

272
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
I'll go look at my books.

273
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
Go get back to my new job.

274
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
Congratulations on your new job!

275
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
Man, she is really gullible.

276
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
- Here you go.- Thanks.

277
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
- Actually, I should get going.- You're sure?

278
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
I can stay out as late as you want.

279
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
I told you I'm onsabbatical from work...

280
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
Yes, yes. You did.

281
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
- Oh, man!- What is wrong now?

282
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
This isn't what I ordered.

283
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
Man! Can't anythinggo right in my life?

284
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
First, my marriage falls apart,and then...

285
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
I know!

286
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
You lose your apartment,you lose your job...

287
00:15:10 --> 00:15:15
...your ex-wife gets married so fast!And now the coffee!

288
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
We need to talk.

289
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
- Sometimes I feel...- No, no, don't.

290
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
I'm going to talk.

291
00:15:23 --> 00:15:24
I believe...

292
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
...that the sun has set...

293
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
...on our day in the sun.

294
00:15:31 --> 00:15:35
You're a very sweet person, Ross.

295
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
Unfortunately...

296
00:15:38 --> 00:15:42
...I just don't think I can takeanother second of you whining!

297
00:15:43 --> 00:15:47
Let me make sureI'm hearing this right.

298
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
You're ending this with me because...

299
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
...I'm too whiny?

300
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
So you're saying...

301
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
...I've become so whiny...

302
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
...that I...

303
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
...annoy you...

304
00:16:03 --> 00:16:04
...Janice.

305
00:16:04 --> 00:16:05
Well, yeah!

306
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
Oh, my God!

307
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
Will you be okay?

308
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
I am now.

309
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
I guess, that's two out of three...

310
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
...Joey!

311
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
Dude, we got to talk.

312
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
I want to tell you something beforeyou heard it from someone else.

313
00:16:39 --> 00:16:43
I hope this isn't too weird but...

314
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
...I had a thing with Janice.

315
00:16:49 --> 00:16:50
You're not mad?

316
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
Why would I be mad?

317
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
Because there's certain rulesabout this kind of stuff.

318
00:16:54 --> 00:16:58
You don't fool around withyour friends' ex-girlfriends...

319
00:16:58 --> 00:17:02
...or possible girlfriendsor girls they're related to.

320
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
I am mad.

321
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
But you know,I'm going to forgive you.

322
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
Because that's what friends do.

323
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
They forgive their friends whenthey do everything you just said.

324
00:17:15 --> 00:17:16
Thank you.

325
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
But I want you to remember...

326
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
...that I forgave you.

327
00:17:21 --> 00:17:25
I also want you to rememberthat I let you live here rent-free.

328
00:17:25 --> 00:17:26
All right.

329
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
And I want you to rememberthat I gave you...

330
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
...twenty-seven dollars.

331
00:17:32 --> 00:17:33
No strings attached!

332
00:17:33 --> 00:17:34
If you can't remember that...

333
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
...we should write it down.Let's write it down!
