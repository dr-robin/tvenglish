2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
There's this woman that I like a lot.

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
But it's complicated.

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
She was with this other guyfor a long time.

5
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
I could never do that to the guy.We're friends.

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
So this guy she used to go out with,is he a good guy?

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:19
The best.

8
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
- Then talk to him.- I don't know.

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
It's worth finding out,if you like her.

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
I do, so much.

11
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
I can't stop thinking about her.I can't...

12
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
You know what?You have to go for it.

13
00:00:31 --> 00:00:35
How often does this happen to you?You owe it to yourself.

14
00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
It's Rachel.

15
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
I'm sorry, did you just sayit's Rachel?

16
00:00:49 --> 00:00:50
Yes.

17
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
You like Rachel?

18
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
Yes. I like Rachel.

19
00:01:04 --> 00:01:05
Rachel?!

20
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...

21
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
You know who else I like? You.

22
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
And it doesn't get said enough.I like you, Ross.

23
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
- Rachel Rachel?- It's not a big deal.

24
00:01:17 --> 00:01:20
It's not a big deal?I'm sorry, I just...

25
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
What about the stuff you said?

26
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
How you can't stop thinking about her?How you can't sleep?

27
00:01:27 --> 00:01:28
I'm an actor, you know?

28
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
As a group, we tend to beoverdramatic.

29
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

30
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
I know it's bad.And I know it's wrong, okay?

31
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
It's not like anything'sever gonna happen.

32
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
These are just feelings.They'll go away.

33
00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
You know, I gotta go.

34
00:01:45 --> 00:01:46
Hey, Ross...

35
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
You know, I just have one...Rachel?!

40
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
Okay, she's kicking.

41
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
She's growing inside you.

42
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
- That was a big one.- That's the youngest girl to reject me.

43
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
- You guys!- Hey there.

44
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
Let me ask you.Do you believe in soul mates?

45
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
Oh, yes, I do.

46
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
There's one person out therefor everyone.

47
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
You know how you find him?Stop looking.

48
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
I've stopped lookingfor Russell Crowe.

49
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
He'll find me.

50
00:02:57 --> 00:02:58
And you?

51
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
No. I believe that certain people aremore suited for each other, but...

52
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
- Soul mates? I don't think they exist.- Good.

53
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
- Why?- Well, last night, I met Monica's.

54
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
What?

55
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
I had a date with this guy.I swear he's her other half.

56
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
You don't think there's somebodybetter suited for Monica than me?

57
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
Well, what's he like?

58
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
- He's tall. He has brown hair.- Of course.

59
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?Oh, unknowable universe!

60
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
- He works with food.- Oh, sure. Older?

61
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
- Obviously. And he's British.- I was just gonna ask!

62
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
And he's so centered,and mature and confident.

63
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
It's so sad they never met.

64
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
Luckily, the guy she settled forcan't hear you.

65
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
Oh, I'm so sorry.Maybe I'm wrong.

66
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
We're going out again.I'll find out more.

67
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
He's meant for her,and you're gonna date him?

68
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
He may not be my soul mate,but a girl's gotta eat.

69
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
I talked to Joey.I wanted to see you.

70
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
I still can't believe it.Joey and Rachel?

71
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
It's like you and me going out,only weirder.

72
00:04:11 --> 00:04:12
I know you're hurting...

73
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
...but don't say that again.

74
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
What if they marry?He'd be the stepfather of my child.

75
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
You don't need to worry.

76
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
He'll never tell her how he feels.

77
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
If he did, you don't knowhow she'd react.

78
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
Sure, women never like Joey.I think he's a virgin.

79
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
- He isn't thinking about going for her.- He's not?

80
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
All he's thinking aboutis how you're taking this.

81
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
It's freaking him out.He wants to move to Vermont.

82
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
- Why?- He wants to leave the country.

83
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
He thinks you hate him.

84
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
Hate him?

85
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
No, I don't hate him.

86
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

87
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
I can't even imagine how hardthis must be for you...

88
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
...but I don't want youto lose Joey over it.

89
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
Right now, he needs to knowthat you're still his friend.

90
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
Okay, I'll talk to him.

91
00:05:12 --> 00:05:13
I'd do it soon.

92
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
He just asked me how to converthis dollars into Vermont money.

93
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
- Hi!- Hi.

94
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
- Chandler, Monica, this is Don.- Hello.

95
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
Soul mate.

96
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
- What are you guys doing?- We had lunch at Adriatica.

97
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
- What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?- I know! Is this 1985?

98
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
- That's what I said! Isn't it strange?- Not really.

99
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

100
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

101
00:05:50 --> 00:05:51
No?

102
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
- What restaurants do you like?- Octavio. 27-and-7.

103
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
- There's this place, Alessandro's.- Oh, my God! I'm the chef!

104
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
You're kidding!Your food is fantastic!

105
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
I want to talk about your menu.Anyone want coffee?

106
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
If you're talking about me,I'll go with you.

107
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
What are you doing?

108
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
I swear, I didn't know you guyswould be here.

109
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
You don't believe in soul mates, so...

110
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
I believe in handsome strangerswho hit on my wife.

111
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
Just because I think they're soul matesdoesn't mean anything'll happen.

112
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
Phoebe? Good work.

113
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
He's great. I love him.

114
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
Don't worry, we'll find yousomeone else.

115
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
I understand if you came by to hit me.I deserve it.

116
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
No, I don't want to hit you.

117
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
What, then? Kick me?

118
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
No.

119
00:06:52 --> 00:06:53
Bite me?

120
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
I don't want to do anything to you.

121
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
I just want to say I'm notmad at you...

122
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
...and that I certainlydo not hate you.

123
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
I just came here to say that.

124
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
Hey, wait, Ross?

125
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
You wanna come infor a beer or something?

126
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
Yeah, sure.

127
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
You got any beer?

128
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
All I got is melon stuffthat Rachel left.

129
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Okay.

130
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
You need to understand something.

131
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
I am never gonna acton this Rachel thing, okay?

132
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardizemy friendship with you.

133
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
Thank you.

134
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
Anyway, it'll just...

135
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
It'll take me a while to get over her.

136
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
I'm not sure how to do that.I've never been in love, so...

137
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
What?

138
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
You're in love with her?

139
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
- Yeah. I thought you knew that.- No.

140
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
Look, if it helps, I don't wantto feel this way, honest.

141
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
I just keep thinking,"I'll get over this," you know?

142
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
But it just keeps getting harder.

143
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
I don't know what to do, you know?

144
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
What do I do?

145
00:08:43 --> 00:08:48
- You need to tell her how you feel.- That's the green stuff talking.

146
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
I'm serious.You need to find out where she is.

147
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
If she's not where you are,you can start to move on.

148
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
But what if,and I'm not saying she will be...

149
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
If she is where you are...

150
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
...then my feeling weirdshouldn't stand in the way.

151
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
- Are you sure?- Yeah.

152
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
If she ends up with somebody else...

153
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
...the truth is,she couldn't find a better guy.

154
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
Hey, thanks.

155
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
- So when are you gonna talk to her?- Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

156
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
I haven't thought about it.What should I say?

157
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
I'm understanding,but let's not get carried away.

158
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
What am I gonna say?

159
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
Yeah, tell me about it.

160
00:09:50 --> 00:09:55
I'm phasing out the wine importingand focusing more on the cheese.

161
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
Cheese, you say?

162
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
That's somepretty smelly work, huh, Don?

163
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
- Excuse me?- Cheese. It's smelly.

164
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
You must smell a lot of the time too.

165
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
Not really. But with cheese,I think the smellier, the better.

166
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
Me too! Chandler hates it.I can't have blue cheese in the house.

167
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
And you're still married to him?

168
00:10:21 --> 00:10:26
I would like to go to France and eatnothing but bread and cheese.

169
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
Not even bread. Just cheese.

170
00:10:28 --> 00:10:29
No, I want the bread.

171
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
And pastries.

172
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
And pate.

173
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
I'm really not high.I just used to be fat.

174
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
I have a villa in the Loire Valleyyou can stay in.

175
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
Is it made of cheese?

176
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
No. A house made of cheese,wouldn't that be great?

177
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
- I'd move in tomorrow!- Oh, come on!

178
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
- Listen to this!- I'm so sorry.

179
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
- What do we do?- They both want a house of cheese.

180
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
I don't know how you fight that.

181
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
Okay, okay. I can do this.I can tell her how I feel.

182
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
Okay, stand up straight.

183
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
Take a couple deep breaths.

184
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
Look confident.

185
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
Joey? What's up?

186
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
I came by becauseI want to talk to you about something.

187
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
What's up?

188
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
Here, in the hall?What are we, animals?

189
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
I'm late for a meeting.Could you make it quick?

190
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
I just came by to tell you that...

191
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
...I want to have dinner with you.

192
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.

193
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
Okay. That's good.

194
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
That gives you a couple of hoursto prepare.

195
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
Don't you people ever knock?

196
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.

197
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
Sure. Set it up.

198
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
I'll just be browsingthrough the personals.

199
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
Are you okay?You're acting weird.

200
00:11:59 --> 00:12:00
Yeah. Fine.

201
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
Not perfect.

202
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
But good enough.

203
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
Jeez, what's with you?

204
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

205
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
- What's going on?- Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

206
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
I don't believe in that,but you two get along.

207
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
I'll step aside if you wanna go withDon and live in a house of cheese.

208
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
- You don't believe in soul mates?- No, but I'm sure "tomatoes" does.

209
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

210
00:12:27 --> 00:12:28
- You don't?- Nope.

211
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
We weren't destinedto end up together.

212
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
We fell in love and work hardat our relationship.

213
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
Some days we work really hard.

214
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
So you don't want to live with Donin a cheese house?

215
00:12:40 --> 00:12:45
No, I've had second thoughts.Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

216
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
- I love you.- I know.

217
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

218
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
I found this place that makesthe greatest jalapeno poppers.

219
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
No? They taste so good.

220
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
It happens whenever Chandlertouches my stomach.

221
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

222
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
- Are you okay?- Yeah, sure.

223
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
Look, the reason...

224
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
Is it hot in here?

225
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
Why don't you take off your sweater?

226
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
This is a nice place...

227
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
...and my T-shirt has a pictureof Calvin doing Hobbes.

228
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

229
00:13:31 --> 00:13:32
Yeah, sure.

230
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
I wouldn't think Hobbeswould like that so much.

231
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
How long have we known each other?

232
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
Seven, eight...

233
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
Eight years. Wow.

234
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
A long time.

235
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
But over the past few weeks, l...

236
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
Okay! Sorry about the wait,but it is mega-jammed in here.

237
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
Our specials tonight...

238
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
- Could you give us a second?- Sure.

239
00:14:01 --> 00:14:02
Second's up!

240
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
Not that kind of table.

241
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
So you were saying?

242
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
I'm not sure.

243
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
You asked how long we knew each other,and I said eight years.

244
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
Then the waiter came overand cut his tip in half...

245
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
...and now here we are.

246
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
Yeah. Here we are.

247
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
I think I'm falling in love with you.

248
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
What?

249
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
I'm falling in love with you.

250
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
Who are you talking to?

251
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

252
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
Funny. It's funny!

253
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
I don't get it.

254
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
Okay.

255
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
Wow.

256
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
Are you...?

257
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
How did...?

258
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
When?

259
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Does it really matter?

260
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
Wow. Wow.

261
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
It is hot in here.

262
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
I know this is a lot.

263
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
You don't have to say anything.

264
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
You take as much time as you need.

265
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
Okay, you gotta say something.

266
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Joey, I love you so much.

267
00:15:53 --> 00:15:54
- But...- But.

268
00:15:55 --> 00:15:56
Joey?

269
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
Right. Hey, that's...

270
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
That's okay. That's fine.

271
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
It's pretty much what I was expecting.

272
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
It's no big deal, all right?

273
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
- I think I'm gonna go.- Please don't leave like this.

274
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

275
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
Don't start doing that.

276
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
You can't do that,because you're gonna make me...

277
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
Oh, there we go!

278
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
- Can I?- Sure.

279
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...

280
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
Hey, hey.

281
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
You can't, okay? Ever.

282
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
I'm so sorry.

283
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
Please don't be sorry.

284
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
Okay? Don't be sorry.

285
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
You know, I was only kidding.

286
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
Yeah, that was a real good one.

287
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
- Is this your table?- Yeah.

288
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
- You'll be here all night.- I know.

289
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
I haven't even read the specials.

290
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
What's the matter?

291
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
I don't know.I think maybe one of them is dying.

292
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
I kind of hope it's the girl.

293
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
The guy is really cute!

294
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
