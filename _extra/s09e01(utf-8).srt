1
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
Joey?

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
Okay.

4
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
So I guess we shouldmake it official, huh?

5
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
Look, Rach, I...

6
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
Hey, Ross is here!Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross!

7
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
- Hey, Ross.- Hey, Joey.

8
00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
- Hey, you.- Hey, you.

9
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
And he brought flowers! Thanks, Ross.I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.

10
00:00:44 --> 00:00:44
You're weird today.

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
Listen, I wanted to talk to youabout something.

12
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
Yeah. Actually, I kind of needto talk to you too.

13
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
- Joey, could you give us a minute?- No.

14
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
- What?- I'm sorry. I meant, "No."

15
00:01:00 --> 00:01:01
Hi. Hey, look who's here.

16
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
Where's my granddaughter?I've been practicing my magic tricks.

17
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
He pulled a quarter out of my ear.

18
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
- Hey, where's Mom?- She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.

19
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
Aunt Liddy's coming?That means we get $5 each!

20
00:01:13 --> 00:01:17
So when do I get to meet Emmaand show her this:

21
00:01:18 --> 00:01:19
Okay, wow.

22
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
Emma's in the nursery.I'll take you now if you want.

23
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
- But I really want to talk to you.- I know. I still need to talk to you.

24
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
But before you guys do that,I need to talk to you.

25
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
And, Ross, I need to talk to you.

26
00:01:30 --> 00:01:32
- And I need to talk to you.- About what?

27
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
To see if you knowwhat these guys are talking about.

31
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
Isn't she beautiful?

32
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
Look at her, my first grandchild.

33
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
What about Ben?

34
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
Well, of course, Ben.I meant my first granddaughter.

35
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
Have you thought any moreabout you and Rachel?

36
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Yeah, actually I was gonna talk to herwhen you guys came in the room.

37
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
That's so exciting! Wow.You could've done that with us there.

38
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
- Yeah, right.- Sure. Okay.

39
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
You can touch yourself in front of us,but you can't talk to Rachel.

40
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
What? When have I evertouched myself in front of you guys?

41
00:02:47 --> 00:02:52
Oh, please. Just before,when you were asleep in the lounge.

42
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
That Armenian family was watching youinstead of the TV.

43
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegianstill has my Game Boy.

44
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
- Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?- Sure.

45
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
Dude, I just did something terrible.

46
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
That was you? I thought it was Jack.

47
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
No, no. That was Jack.Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.

48
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
- What? Why does she think that?- Because it kind of looked like I did.

49
00:03:17 --> 00:03:18
Again, what?

50
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
Okay, I was down on one kneewith the ring in my hand...

51
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
As we all are at some pointduring the day.

52
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
It wasn't my ring.It fell out of Ross' jacket...

53
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
...and when I knelt down to pick it up,Rachel thought I was proposing.

54
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
Ross had a ring?And he was gonna propose?

55
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
- I guess.- And you did it first?

56
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
This is gonna kill him. You knowhow much he loves to propose.

57
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
I know. I know. It's awful.

58
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
Well, what did she say?

59
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
She said, "Yes."

60
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
Does Ross know?

61
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
Oh, my God.What the hell am I gonna tell him?

62
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
- Maybe you don't have to tell him.- I like that. Yeah.

63
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
If you clear things up with Rachel,Ross never needs to find out.

64
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
But you have to do it beforehe hears about it and kicks your ass.

65
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
All right, let's not get carried away.

66
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
I want a baby.

67
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
Honey, we've been over this.I need to be facing the other way.

68
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
If we have sex again, it'll doubleour chances of getting pregnant.

69
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
- I think that closet's still available.- I am so tired.

70
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
- Yeah, okay, but no foreplay.- Deal!

71
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
Dad, seriously!

72
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
You know, you really shouldsee someone about that.

73
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
Noted.

74
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

75
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
Are you kidding me?I could stay and look at her forever.

76
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
Actually...

77
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
- Hey.- Hi.

78
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
Are you all right?

79
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
- I think I just got engaged.- Oh, my God! He did it?

80
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
What? Did you knowhe was gonna ask me?

81
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
Are you kidding?I'm, like, the one who talked him into it.

82
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
I like to think of myselfas the puppet master of the group.

83
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
- And you really think this is a good idea?- I just talked him into it.

84
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
Don't tell me I have to do you too?

85
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
- The puppet master gets tired, people.- Okay.

86
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.

87
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
Why? You two are so meantto be together. Everybody thinks so.

88
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
Really? Even Ross?

89
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
Especially Ross.

90
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
Hey, Pheebs. You know what?I'll come back later.

91
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
Wow. Kind of a full house here.

92
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
I guess I'll just... I'll come back.

93
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
There he goes. Your fiance.

94
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
I guess so.

95
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
Although he doesplay with himself in his sleep.

96
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
I can't say I'm surprised.

97
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
- Dad, what are you doing?- There are people in there having sex.

98
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
It can't be me. I'm standing right here.

99
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
- Wanna peek?- No!

100
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
Come on.

101
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
You know what?I don't like you without Mom.

102
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
Come on.

103
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
We're not peeking?

104
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
Well, I'm peeking.

105
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Oh, my God!

106
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
Hello, sir. You know Monica.

107
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
- Hey, is it okay to come in?- Of course.

108
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
Joey, this ring, l...It's beautiful. I love it.

109
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
Yeah. Look, Rach,there's something I gotta tell you.

110
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
- Hey.- Hi.

111
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
- Are you ready to try nursing again?- Yeah. Hi, Emma.

112
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Why do you thinkshe won't take my breast?

113
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
It's all right.It takes babies a while to get it.

114
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
- But don't worry, it'll happen.- Okay.

115
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
Okay, sweetie, you can do it.Just open up and put it in your mouth.

116
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Dear Lord.

117
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
- I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?- Yeah, look, I think that...

118
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
Because, look! She's pulling away again.

119
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
Do you think my nipplesare too big for her mouth?

120
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
She looks scared.Doesn't she look scared?

121
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
You know, I don't really know her.

122
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
Why don't we try massagingthe breast to stimulate the flow?

123
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
- Okay.- Are you kidding me?

124
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
This is so frustrating.Why doesn't she want my breast?

125
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!

126
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
- Hey, wait up.- Hi.

127
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
Congratulations.

128
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
I didn't want to say anything in frontof Joey. I didn't know if he knew.

129
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
What? That we had a baby?Now let's give him a little credit.

130
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
Although he did eat a pieceof plastic fruit earlier.

131
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
No, no, that youand Rachel are engaged.

132
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
- What?- Oh, it's a secret?

133
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
Goody. Yes! We haven't donethe secret thing in a long time.

134
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?I didn't propose.

135
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
Are you lying?

136
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
Is this like that time you triedto convince us you were a doctor?

137
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
I am a doctor!

138
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
You know what? I'm just gonna goand talk to Rachel myself.

139
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
All right. Well, me too.

140
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
- Well, should we wake her up?- No. No. Come on, let her sleep.

141
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
- She's so exhausted.- And so engaged.

142
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged!

143
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
Why? Why, why wouldshe think we're engaged?

144
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
Perhaps because you gave heran engagement ring?

145
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
You know, Ross,doctors are supposed to be smart.

146
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
- I didn't give her that ring.- You didn't?

147
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
- No!- So whose ring is it?

148
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
It's mine.

149
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
- Is it an engagement ring?- Yes.

150
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
- But you didn't give it to her?- No.

151
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
- But you were going to propose?- No!

152
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
I might be losing interest in this.

153
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
Look. Look, my momgave me that ring...

154
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
...because she wanted meto propose to Rachel.

155
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
But all I wanted to do was see...

156
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
...if she maybe, kind of wantedto start things up again.

157
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

158
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
I didn't want to rush into anything.It seemed like she didn't want to either.

159
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
But I don't understandhow any of this happened.

160
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
What, did she find the ring in my jacket,assume I was gonna propose...

161
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
...throw it onand just start telling people?

162
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
No, no. She said youactually proposed to her.

163
00:09:17 --> 00:09:22
Well, I didn't! I didn't propose!

164
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
Unless...

165
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
Did I?

166
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
I haven't slept in 40 hours and...

167
00:09:35 --> 00:09:39
It does soundlike something I would do.

168
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
Look, we can't stay in here forever.

169
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
It's just, I still can't believethat my dad saw us having sex.

170
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
He didn't make it to oneof my piano recitals, but this he sees!

171
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
This is okay. We're all adults here.There's nothing to be ashamed of.

172
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
Now, let's put our underwearin our pockets and walk out the door.

173
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
Hi, Dad.

174
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
- I can still call you that, right?- Of course. I'll always be your dad.

175
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
I just want you to know that what youwitnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.

176
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
- It wasn't fun?- Why, why, why would you...?

177
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
Look, I just don't want you to think...

178
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
...that we're animals who do itwhenever we want.

179
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
Well, I don't think that.

180
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
Before today, I never thoughtof you two having sex at all.

181
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
It was a simpler time.

182
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.

183
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
- What?- Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.

184
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

185
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
Well, get back in there!I'll guard the door!

186
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
That's okay, Dad,we can wait until later.

187
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
Whoa! I don't think so.Aren't you ovulating?

188
00:10:46 --> 00:10:47
Daddy!

189
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
You gotta get at it, princess.

190
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
When your mother and Iwere trying to conceive you...

191
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
...whenever she was ovulating,bam, we did it!

192
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
That's how I got my bad hip.

193
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
That's funny. This conversation's howI got the bullet hole in my head.

194
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
This one time I had my kneeon the sink, and your mother was...

195
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
Daddy, I don't think we need to hearthe specific positions you and Mom had.

196
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
You're right.This is about your positions.

197
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
Now, what I saw in the closetis not the optimum position...

198
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
...for conceiving a child.

199
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
- Although it might feel good.- I don't feel good right now.

200
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
But pleasure is important,and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.

201
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
You up to the task, sailor?

202
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
Seriously, sir,my brains, all over the wall.

203
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
- Hey.- Hey. Oh, I need to tell you something.

204
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
Well, now's a good time.I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.

205
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
Joey asked me to marry him.

206
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
- What?- Joey proposed to me.

207
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
- Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!- Well, I said yes.

208
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
What, are you crazy?You just had Ross' baby!

209
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
It's so inappropriate.No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.

210
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
It is bigger than mine!

211
00:11:51 --> 00:11:55
I know. "Days of our Lives",thank you very much.

212
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
- You can't marry him.- Why not?

213
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
Come on, I don't want to do this alone,and he's such a sweet guy.

214
00:12:00 --> 00:12:01
And he loves me so much.

215
00:12:01 --> 00:12:02
Well, do you love him?

216
00:12:03 --> 00:12:04
Sure.

217
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
- Sure?- Yeah, I mean, whatever.

218
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
Honey, the question is...

219
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
...do you really want to marry Joey?

220
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
No.

221
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
No, I don't.

222
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
Could you be a dear and go tell him?

223
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
You still haven't told Rachelyou weren't proposing?

224
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
No. She had the ring on...

225
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
...she seemed so excited,and then she took her breast out.

226
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
Joey, you have to tell her what'sgoing on. And what did it look like?

227
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
I didn't look at it.

228
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
The stupid baby's headwas blocking most of it.

229
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
Go and tell Rachel right now,before Ross finds out.

230
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
Look, it's not that easy.She said she wanted to marry me.

231
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
I don't want to hurt her.

232
00:12:47 --> 00:12:48
Okay, look, just do it gently.

233
00:12:50 --> 00:12:50
You're right.

234
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
You're right. I'll go tell her nowbefore Ross finds out, and I'll be gentle.

235
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
I can do that. I am a gentle person.

236
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
By the way, two people screwingin there if you want to check that out.

237
00:13:08 --> 00:13:09
Hey.

238
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
Hey.

239
00:13:14 --> 00:13:15
Listen, I heard about the engagement.

240
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
Surprised?

241
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
And confused.

242
00:13:23 --> 00:13:26
Rach, sweetie...

243
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
...I didn't propose to you.

244
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
I know.

245
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
I don't think you do.

246
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
You didn't propose to me.

247
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
Joey did.

248
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
Poor baby, you're so tired.

249
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
Rach, I didn't propose to you.

250
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
Joey didn't propose to you.

251
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
And Chandler didn't propose to you.

252
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
You didn't propose to me.

253
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
Chandler didn't propose to me.

254
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
But Joey did.

255
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
Joey proposed to you?

256
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
- I can come back.- Wait. Wait. Wait.

257
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
- Joey, did you propose to her?- No.

258
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
- Yes, you did.- Actually, technically, I didn't.

259
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
- Well, then, why did you give me a ring?- Wait.

260
00:14:18 --> 00:14:23
- You gave her the ring?- No, and I did not ask her to marry me.

261
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
- Yes, you did.- No, I didn't.

262
00:14:24 --> 00:14:25
- Yes, you did.- No, I didn't.

263
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
Yes, you did, and don'tyou say you didn't!

264
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
He was right there. He got downon one knee and he proposed.

265
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
- You were down on one knee?- Yeah, that looks bad.

266
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
But I didn't propose.

267
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
- Then what did happen?- Yeah, what did happen?

268
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
Okay, the ring fell on the floor,and I went down to pick it up...

269
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
...and you thought I was proposing.

270
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
Yeah, but you said,"Will you marry me?"

271
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
- No, I didn't.- Yes, you did.

272
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
- No, I didn't.- Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.

273
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
- Why didn't you tell me that before?- Well, I tried...

274
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
...but people kept coming in,and then you took your breast out.

275
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
You saw her breast?

276
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.

277
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
Then what the hell were youdoing with an engagement ring?

278
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.

279
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
That's why I felt so bad, Rach,because he was gonna propose.

280
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
What?!

281
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
You were gonna propose to me?

282
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
No.

283
00:15:37 --> 00:15:38
Well, this is awkward.

284
00:15:40 --> 00:15:45
But I was going to see if, you know,maybe you wanted to start dating again.

285
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
- But that, I mean, that was all, Rach.- Dude, step up. I proposed.

286
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
No, you didn't.

287
00:15:51 --> 00:15:56
That's right. There's a lot going on here,and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

288
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
Hey, she just woke up. She's hungry.Why don't we give this another try?

289
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
I can't believe you told herI was gonna propose.

290
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
- I can't believe you're not gonna.- Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.

291
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
Yeah, dude, I totally understand.

292
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
Usually after I have a baby witha woman, I like to slow things down!

293
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
- Oh, my God!- What?

294
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
She's doing it!She's breast-feeding!

295
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
It's beautiful.

296
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
- I'll come back for her later.- Thank you.

297
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
- Wow, this feels weird.- What, good weird?

298
00:16:26 --> 00:16:27
Wonderful weird.

299
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
You know what, you guys?I'm gonna go too.

300
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
And I'm sorry about everything.

301
00:16:34 --> 00:16:37
- Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.- No, Rach, I should've told you sooner.

302
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
It's just that...

303
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
Man, that kid is going to town!

304
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
She's perfect.

305
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
We're so lucky.

306
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
We really are.

307
00:17:01 --> 00:17:06
Look, I know it's not a proposal,and I don't know where you are...

308
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
...but with everything that's beengoing on and with Emma, I'm...

309
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
- I've been feeling...- Yeah, I know.

310
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
I've been feeling...

311
00:17:14 --> 00:17:15
- Yeah?- Yeah.

312
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
Okay, well, that...Wow, okay, well...

313
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
Then maybe at least we cantalk about us again?

314
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
Yeah. Maybe.

315
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
Well, good. Okay.

316
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
I kind of think, you know, if we, if...

317
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
You're wearing the ring.

318
00:17:40 --> 00:17:41
What's that?

319
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
And you told Phoebeyou were engaged.

320
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
I'm sorry, what?

321
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
When you thought Joey proposed...

322
00:17:56 --> 00:17:57
...did you say yes?

323
00:18:06 --> 00:18:11
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked upthese pamphlets on how to get pregnant.

324
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
- Hey, Dad.- Hi.

325
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
Sorry to bother you again,but could you pass my pamphlets back?

326
00:18:24 --> 00:18:25
Thank you.
