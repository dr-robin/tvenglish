1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
Come on, no peeking.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
Our eyes are closed, and we'recrossing the street. Very good.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
Okay. Open up!

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
What do you want to show us?

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
Because all I can seeis this bitchin' van!

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
It's for our catering business.

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
I think I know that girl.

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
We won't keep it this way though.

9
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
We'll replace the swordwith a baguette.

10
00:00:31 --> 00:00:35
Also, we don't knowwhat to do with this.

11
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.

12
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
The One WhereThey're Going To Party!

13
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
Remember that guy thatput cilantro in everything?

14
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
Sure, Cilantro Larry!

15
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
I'm filling in for him asfood critic for the "Chelsea Reporter".

16
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
What an amazing opportunityto influence...

17
00:01:30 --> 00:01:32
...dozens of people!

18
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
What about our catering business?

19
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
It's just one night a week.

20
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
Plus, I get to take you outfor free dinners.

21
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
Well, in that case...

22
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
That was me, hopping on board.

23
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross!

24
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
Quick question for you.

25
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
Are you ready to party?

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
I could maybe go outfor a couple of beers.

27
00:01:55 --> 00:01:59
There's this thing about beeson the Discovery Channel.

28
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
I don't think you heard me.Are you ready...

29
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
...to party?

30
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
Gandalf?Gandalf is coming to town?

31
00:02:07 --> 00:02:11
I have nothing to do, so tomorrowwe are partying with Gandalf, dude!

32
00:02:11 --> 00:02:15
Dude, we are so going to party!

33
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
Wow, okay. Dude alert!

34
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
Who is this guy?

35
00:02:19 --> 00:02:23
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.Only the funnest guy in the world.

36
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
I'll call to get off work tomorrow.

37
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
I'll call after you!

38
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
This will be so cool!We never party anymore.

39
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
Were you smoking somethingin the back of our van?

40
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
"We never have fun anymore"?You have fun with me.

41
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
Remember those strippers?And you paid me $50 to eat that book?

42
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
You are going to love this guy.Gandalf is the party wizard.

43
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Why do you call him "Gandalf"?

44
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
Gandalf the Wizard.

45
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
Didn't you read"Lord of the Rings" in high school?

46
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
No, I had sex in high school.

47
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
Joanna? I was wondering ifI could ask you something.

48
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
There's an opening fora buyer in Junior Miss...

49
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
That'd be a step down for me.

50
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
Actually, I meant for me.

51
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
The hiring committeeis meeting people all day and...

52
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
I guess you can't staymy assistant forever.

53
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21
Neither can you, Sophie,but for different reasons.

54
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
I'm so glad you don't have a problem.If you did, I wouldn't apply.

55
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
In that case...

56
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
That's why I'm gladthere's no problem.

57
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
I'm on the hiring committee,so there'll be one friendly face.

58
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
That's great!

59
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
Junior Miss is where I started.

60
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
I slept with the ugliest guyto get that job.

61
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
Really?

62
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
I mean, no.

63
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
With your qualifications,you won't need to do that.

64
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
Although I might needsome convincing.

65
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
Kidding!

66
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
God, I feel wild today!

67
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
Man, I am so excited,I may vomit.

68
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
Will you calm down?He's just a human guy.

69
00:04:09 --> 00:04:10
You don't understand.He's amazing.

70
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
You never know what'll happen.

71
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
You go out for beerand end up on a boat to Nova Scotia.

72
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
It's beautiful country up there.

73
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
I got my passport, fresh socks,and a snakebite kit.

74
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
It won't be exactly like last time.

75
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
I'll see you guys.

76
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
I have an audition,but I'll meet you.

77
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Where will you be around noon?

78
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
Somewhere maybe along the equator?

79
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
It's Gandalf!

80
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
So are you in town?

81
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
Maybe next time, then.

82
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
What happened?

83
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
He can't come.He's stuck in Chicago.

84
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
Oh, man!

85
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
Chicago's so lucky.

86
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
Stupid, useless...

87
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
...Canadian money!

88
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
You have a very impressive résumé,Miss Greene.

89
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
I especially like what I see aboutimplementing a new filing system.

90
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
Thank you.

91
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
Filing system? Those colored labelsyou put on all the folders?

92
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
It did brighten upthe filing cabinets.

93
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
They did more than that.

94
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
I notice you've been entrusted witha lot of important responsibilities.

95
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
Joanna really has beenan incredible mentor to me.

96
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
Rachel has been incredibleat getting my bagels.

97
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
She gets it right almost every time.

98
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
Of course, I have moreresponsibilities than that.

99
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
Of course!There's the coffee too.

100
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
Rachel can carry two things at once.

101
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
That's very good.

102
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
Now a big part of this job is...

103
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
...cultivating personal relationships,especially with designers.

104
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
- Yes, I...- She shouldn't have any problem.

105
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
Her only problem might be gettingtoo friendly, you know?

106
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
I love working with designers.

107
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
With them. Under them.What's the difference?

108
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
My first review is out.

109
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
The "Chelsea Reporter".

110
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
These used to keep me so warm.

111
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
Look, I'm on the back page.

112
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
"Would I go back to Allesandro's?Sure, I'd get two meals."

113
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
"One for me, and one for the guypointing the gun to my head."

114
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
You really laid into this place.

115
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
They don't pay me a pennya word to make friends.

116
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
I found a guy who'd fix upthe van for catering.

117
00:06:33 --> 00:06:33
You want me to go?

118
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
It's okay. Are we surewe don't want the waterbed?

119
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
Haven't we made this decision?

120
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
Yeah, all right.

121
00:06:47 --> 00:06:51
- It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.

122
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
about your review.

123
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
Call me on the phone.

124
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
What? So you can hang up on me?

125
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
I'll never let you up,so just go away.

126
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
- Do you need to get in?

127
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
No, Phoebe!

128
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
Hey, Monica!

129
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
I want a retraction.Our food is not "inedible swill".

130
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
I couldn't eat it.

131
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
My five friends couldn't eat it,and one of them eats books.

132
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Our service isn't"grossly incompetent".

133
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
The waiter carriedthe breadsticks in his pants.

134
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
Well, you said that we acceptthe Discover Card...

135
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
...which we do not!

136
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
All right, that I'll retract.

137
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
But I stand by my review.I know food, and that wasn't it.

138
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
Your marinara is like tomato juice.

139
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
You should serve itwith vodka and celery.

140
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
I'm proud of that sauce.It's delicious.

141
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
You own an Italian restaurant,and you think that tastes good?

142
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
Where are you from?

143
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
Lebanon.

144
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
Hand me those tomatoes.

145
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
I'll show youwhat it should taste like.

146
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
How long will this take?I got another critic I got to yell at.

147
00:08:03 --> 00:08:05
Joanna, I want to talkabout that interview.

148
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
I thought it went very well.

149
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
No, it didn't. That's whatI want to talk to you about.

150
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
Now just to brief you...

151
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
...I may cry.

152
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
But they are nottears of sadness or of anger...

153
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
...but just of us havingthis discussion.

154
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
Please, don't make a scene.

155
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
There's nobody here.

156
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
Sophie, get in here.

157
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
See? You're makingSophie uncomfortable.

158
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
No, she's not.

159
00:08:35 --> 00:08:40
Congratulations. You crossedthe line into completely useless.

160
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
Do you want me to quit?

161
00:08:43 --> 00:08:44
What makes you think that?

162
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
Those things you saidin the interview...

163
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
...if you believe them,I must not be a good assistant.

164
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
You know what?

165
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
I am just going to pack up my desk...

166
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
...and I will be goneby the end of the day.

167
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
There's no use stayingtill the end of the day.

168
00:09:05 --> 00:09:06
Wait, wait.

169
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
You can putyour sad little muffin back.

170
00:09:09 --> 00:09:14
If you must know the truth,I didn't want to lose a good assistant.

171
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
That's why I said those thingsabout your flirting and drinking.

172
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
My drinking?

173
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
I must have said thatafter you left.

174
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
Said what, exactly?

175
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
You enjoy the occasional drink...

176
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
...- ing binge.

177
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
Oh, my God!That is it. I'm leaving!

178
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
You are just a horrible person!

179
00:09:33 --> 00:09:34
Wait, wait.

180
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
If you're going to getall sensitive about it.

181
00:09:36 --> 00:09:37
I don't want to lose you.

182
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
What if I create a position for you?

183
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
I'll make you assistant buyerin this department.

184
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
Say more things like that.

185
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
Your own office and a raise,effective tomorrow.

186
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
- I need an expense account.- Done!

187
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
- And an assistant.- Sophie!

188
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
Hey, I thought you'd beout partying with Gandol...

189
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
...- dorf.

190
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.

191
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
You've been sitting here all day?

192
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
I balanced my checkbook.

193
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
And I gave first namesto all the foosball players.

194
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
I can't believe he didn't come.

195
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
So what? We can still go outand party ourselves.

196
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
With Gandalf, we'd be out all night.

197
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
We'd meet total strangersand hang out with them.

198
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
We could do that.

199
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
There was other stuff too.

200
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
We'll do it all and better!

201
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
After tonight, Gandalf will wantto party with us, dude!

202
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
As if wedon't know how to party!

203
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
All right! Let's go.

204
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
Maybe we could end upon a boat again?

205
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
All right!

206
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
When were we on a boat?

207
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
Remember that cold morningwhen those dogs were licking your face?

208
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
Those were seals, man.

209
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
How would this suitlook on an assistant buyer...

210
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
The owner of Allesandro'scame to yell at me.

211
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
But I made him sauce, and heoffered me the job as head chef!

212
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
You just ruined the thingI was practicing, but I'm so happy!

213
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
Can you believe it?I get to run my own kitchen!

214
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
Oh, you've waited so long.

215
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
Pheebs! Quick question for you.

216
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
How would this suit look...

217
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
...on an assistant buyerat Bloomingdale's?

218
00:11:23 --> 00:11:27
It would totally dependon her coloring and...

219
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
You got the job!

220
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
You got the job?Why didn't you tell me?

221
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
It'll be so great!I'll help decide what we sell.

222
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
I'll have an officewith walls and everything.

223
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
I'm going to have walls!

224
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
Is this the day of good news or what?I got us a job.

225
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
The wedding reception.

226
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
I kind of need totalk to you about that.

227
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
I think it's time for me to takea step back from the catering.

228
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
But we've only had one job.

229
00:11:58 --> 00:12:03
But now we have this second one,and it feels like it's snowballing.

230
00:12:03 --> 00:12:04
What are you saying?

231
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
I got offered the head chef jobat Allesandro's.

232
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
It's okay, becauseyou don't really need me.

233
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
You're the cook!

234
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
Without you, it's just medriving up to people's houses...

235
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
...with empty trays,asking for money.

236
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
All right. But I'll pay you backall the money you invested.

237
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
And you can keep the van!

238
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
For what?

239
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
I can't believe this!

240
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
I got to get out of here.

241
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
Phoebe, wait a minute.

242
00:12:35 --> 00:12:38
I'm an assistant buyer!

243
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
We'll get coffee, get energized,then head back out.

244
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
- Yeah, all right.- Okay.

245
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
So we're having fun, right?

246
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
We don't need that wizard guy.

247
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
We hit some clubs,talk to some strangers...

248
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
...then go down to the docksand see about that boat thing.

249
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
I'm kind of beat.

250
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
Actually...

251
00:13:02 --> 00:13:03
...me too.

252
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
Are you serious?

253
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
Thank God! I'm exhausted.

254
00:13:08 --> 00:13:09
You guys want coffees?

255
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
I don't want to be up too late,so I'll have a decaf.

256
00:13:12 --> 00:13:13
Yeah, me too.

257
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
Actually, could I getsome hot water with lemon?

258
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
I strained my voice screaming in there.Does it have to be so loud?

259
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
I can't hear a word.My ears are ringing so bad.

260
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
I was glad I hadthat extra pair of socks.

261
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
I used them as mittens.

262
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
I didn't want to touch a thingin that last place.

263
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
How sad are we?

264
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
Yeah, I know.

265
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
You know what?We're not sad.

266
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
We're just not 21 anymore.You know?

267
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
I'm 29 years old, dammit!

268
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
I want to sit in acomfortable chair, watch TV...

269
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
...and go to sleepat a reasonable hour.

270
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
I like to hang out in a quiet placewhere I can talk to my friends.

271
00:13:51 --> 00:13:57
And so what if I like to go home,put on Kenny G and take a bath?

272
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
We're 29.We're not women.

273
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
There you are.

274
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
I'm glad you decided to hear me out.

275
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
Okay, I'm hearing.

276
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

277
00:14:15 --> 00:14:20
I came up with a bunch of businessesthat you can do with your van.

278
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
You could bea flower delivery person.

279
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
Or a bakery delivery person?

280
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
Pizza?

281
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
I got a whole bunchof stuff in this area.

282
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
But I get the feelingyou don't want to deliver.

283
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
I guess if youdon't want to deliver...

284
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
...you probably don't wantto pick up stuff either.

285
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
You know what?

286
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
Let's do the catering business.

287
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
Really? Are you sure?

288
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
Yeah, I made a commitment to you.

289
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
It'd be fun.

290
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
It will be fun!

291
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
Let's plan the wedding reception.

292
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
You really wanted meto do something with this van.

293
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
You know what?I want you to take the chef job.

294
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
Really?

295
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
That's what you really want.

296
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
I don't want to be the reasonyou're unhappy. I'd be unhappy.

297
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
And I really don't want to bethe reason I'm unhappy.

298
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
Thank you.

299
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
Besides, it might be kind of funto form the new A-Team.

300
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
Hi, Mrs. Lynch.

301
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
Is Joanna in already?

302
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
Oh, my goodness!You haven't heard.

303
00:15:45 --> 00:15:45
What?

304
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47
Joanna...

305
00:15:47 --> 00:15:48
...passed away last night.

306
00:15:49 --> 00:15:51
Oh, my God! How?

307
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
She was leaving work,and she was hit by a cab.

308
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
Oh, my God!I cannot believe it!

309
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
I know.

310
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
I didn't realizethat you were so close.

311
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
Yes. So close!

312
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
I know that this is an emotionaland difficult time for all of us.

313
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
But by any chance, did Joanna...

314
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
...send any paperworkyour way before...

315
00:16:19 --> 00:16:20
...it happened?

316
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
No, nothing.

317
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
Imagine...

318
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
...if she'd just stepped offthat curb a few seconds later.

319
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
Yes, just a few secondsand she'd still be with us.

320
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

321
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
I'm sorry. I have to go.

322
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
Good morning!

323
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
You didn't hear about Joanna.

324
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
I sure did!

325
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
I'm excited about havingMonica on board with us.

326
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
Although I do feel badabout having fired Chef Emilio.

327
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
It is like losinga member of the family.

328
00:16:54 --> 00:16:59
Of course, that literallyis the case for several of you.

329
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

330
00:17:01 --> 00:17:05
...please tell your fatherhow much we're going to miss him.

331
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
I know Monica has a lotof great ideas for this place.

332
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
Well, you all read the review.

333
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
So without much further ado...

334
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
...I present to youour new head chef.

335
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
I just want to say thatwith a pinch of excitement...

336
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
...a dash of hard workand a dollop of cooperation...

337
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
...we can have the recipe...

338
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
Are you going to kill me?
