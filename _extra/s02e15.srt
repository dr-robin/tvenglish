3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
All right, no peeking.

4
00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
No peeking.

5
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
No peeking. No peeking!

6
00:00:06 --> 00:00:10
All right, but you better bewearing clothes when I open my eyes.

7
00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
All right. Open your eyes!

8
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
Sweet mother of allthat is good and pure!

9
00:00:20 --> 00:00:21
Days of our Livespicked up my option!

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
- Congratulations!- I know!

11
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
Now we can watch "Green Acres"the way it was meant to be seen.

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
So which one is mine?

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
Whichever one you want, man.Whichever one you want!

14
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
Not that one.

15
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
Oh, yes!

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

17
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
Do we dare?

18
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
We dare.

00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
I can't believe two cowsmade the ultimate sacrifice...

22
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
...so you could watch TVwith your feet up.

23
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

24
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
They never would have survivedin the wild.

25
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
This screen is amazing.Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.

26
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
Rose Marie belongs ona smaller screen, doesn't she?

27
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
Hi, you guys.

28
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
Hey, you.

29
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
How was your day?

30
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
You know, pretty much the usual.

31
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
Sun shining, birds chirping.

32
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
Really? Mine too.

33
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
Hey, cool! Mine too!

34
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
I gotta get to the museum.

35
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
So I'll see you tonight?

Hello?

41
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34

00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
You're supposed to waitress for me?My catering thing?

43
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
- Any of that trigger anything?- Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

44
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
This is our first date.

45
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
- Yes, but my mom got me this job.- I can be a waitress!

46
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
Thank you, thank you.See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

47
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
Really, Pheebs?You'd have to be an actual waitress.

48
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
This can't be like your"I can be a bear cub" thing.

49
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
I can be a waitress.Okay, watch this.

50
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Give me two number ones,86 the bacon...

51
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
...one Adam and Eve on a raftand wreck them!

52
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
It's James Bond!

53
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
- Sorry we're late.- That's okay. Come on in.

54
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
Is Monica Geller coming?I was told she was.

55
00:03:17 --> 00:03:18
Dr. Burke, it's me.

56
00:03:19 --> 00:03:20
Monica?

57
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
My God! You used to be so...

58
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
I mean, you've...You must have lost like...

59
00:03:27 --> 00:03:28
You look great.

60
00:03:28 --> 00:03:28
Thank you.

61
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
This is Phoebe.She'll be helping me.

62
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
- So how you been?- Great. How have you been?

64
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
Obviously you knowBarbara and I split up...

65
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

66
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
The head tilt?

67
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
Since the divorce,everybody asks how I am...

68
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
...with a sympathetic head tilt."How you doing? You okay?"

69
00:03:49 --> 00:03:50
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
It's fine.Believe me, I do it too.

71
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
I always answer with the"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."

72
00:03:56 --> 00:03:57
"You're sure?"

73
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
"Yeah, I'm fine."

74
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
I gotta set up the music.I got a new CD changer.

75
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
Of course, the divorce only leftme with four CDs to change.

76
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
That's too bad.

77
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
I'll survive.

78
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
Two larges, extra cheese on both.

79
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
But listen...

80
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

81
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Ring 20. Geller/Greene.

82
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
They'll let you in, okay?

83
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
If you buzz our door,there's no tip for you.

84
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
Okay, thanks.

85
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
Pizza's on the way.I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

86
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
What if we have to pee?

87
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
I'll cancel the sodas.

88
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
Get back out there.It's your party!

89
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
But they're so dull!They're all ophthalmologists.

90
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
You're an ophthalmologist.

91
00:04:48 --> 00:04:52
Because my parents wanted me to be.I wanted to be a sheriff.

92
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
That's funny.Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

93
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
But you stay out there!

94
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
- You see?- I tell you what.

95
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
I'll come get you in five minuteswith some sort of kebob emergency.

96
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
Better.

97
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Oh, God, here we go.

98
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

99
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
Watch this.

100
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Who needs glasses?

101
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
You are so smitten.

102
00:05:19 --> 00:05:20
I am not!

103
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
Oh, you are so muchthe smitten kitten.

104
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
- You should ask him out.- Dr. Burke?

105
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
I don't think so.I mean, like, he's a grownup.

106
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
So? You two aretotally into each other.

107
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
He's a friend of my parents.He's like 20 years older than me.

108
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
So you're never gonna see him again?

109
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Not never.

110
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
I'm gonna see him tomorrowat my eye appointment.

111
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
- Didn't you just get your eyes checked?- Yeah, but you know...

112
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
...27 is...

113
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
...a dangerous eye age.

114
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.I'm just saying it was a little...

115
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
...hard to follow.

116
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
I told you there'd be subtitles.

117
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
I know.

118
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
I just didn't want to wearmy glasses on our first date.

119
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
Monica?

120
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
It would help when I'm kissingif you didn't shout my sister's name.

121
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
Honey, I'm just checking.

122
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
- Monica?- Mon?

123
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
What?

124
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
It's just, when you movedyour hands down to my butt...

126
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
...it was, like, "Whoa!Ross' hands are on my butt!"

127
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
And that's funny. Why?

128
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
Well, it's not.

129
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
I'm sorry.I guess I'm just nervous.

130
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
I mean, it's you.

131
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
You know, it's us.

132
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
We're crossing that line.It's sort of a big thing.

133
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
Well, I know it's big.I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

134
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
Okay, my hands werenowhere near your butt.

135
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
I know, I know, I know!

136
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
I was thinking about whenthey were there the last time.

137
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.Okay, look! I promise.

138
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
I won't laugh anymore.Put your hands back there.

139
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
No, see, now I can't.

140
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
- I feel self-conscious.- Just one cheek.

141
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
The moment's gone.

142
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
- I'll back up into your hands.- That's romantic.

143
00:07:44 --> 00:07:45
- No.

144
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
- No!

145
00:07:47 --> 00:07:47
Rub it?

146
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Would you just grab my ass?

147
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
Wow! Look at that!The car is on fire...

148
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
...yet somehowits expensive paint job...

149
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

150
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
You've got a Cheetoon your face, man.

151
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
Aren't you supposedto be out with Rachel?

152
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
That was 14 hours ago.

153
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
So how'd it go?

154
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
Have you ever been, you know,fooling around with a girl...

155
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
...and she started laughing?

156
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
But it was 1982...

157
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircutwas tickling her chin.

158
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
She laughed at you?

159
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
I've been wanting thissince ninth grade typing.

160
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
And I just want it to be perfect...

161
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
...and right and...

162
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
Why isn't that laser beamcutting through the paint?

163
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
- It's the Miracle Wax!- It certainly is a miracle.

164
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
Hi, you guys.

165
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Listen, I was thinking about...

166
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
Can you guys speak up?

167
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
It's harder for us to hear youwhen you lower your voice.

168
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
I'm sorry about last night.I really want to make it up to you.

169
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
There's no need to make it up...

170
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
How?

171
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
Well, I was thinkingmaybe a romantic dinner...

172
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
...with candles and wine.

173
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
And then maybe goingback to my place...

174
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
...for dessert.

175
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
That sounds...

176
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
...perfect?

177
00:09:34 --> 00:09:34
What's this?

178
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
Would you get us a couple of beers?

179
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

180
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
Really?

181
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
That's my job.

182
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
All right.

183
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
Look up.

184
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
Look down.

185
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
Now, open your eyes and look down.

186
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
That's right.

187
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
Look into the light.

188
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
Now look at me.

189
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
Your eyes look good.Those are good eyes.

190
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
Good. They feel good.

191
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
In my head.

192
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
- It was great to see you.- You too.

193
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
You too.

194
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
Goodbye.

195
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
Drops!

196
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
Here, they're free.

197
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
Thanks.

198
00:10:36 --> 00:10:36
I better be going.

199
00:10:37 --> 00:10:38
Yeah, I'll see you later.

200
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
Thanks again.

201
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
We have to get you lazy boysout of these chairs.

202
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
You should go outside and be withthe three-dimensional people.

203
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
No. Inside good.

204
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
Outside bad.

205
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
You guys are so pathetic.

206
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
Oh, "Xanadu"!

207
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
She's one of us now.

208
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
We just wanted to stop byand say good night.

209
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
Good night.

210
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
They won't even turn their heads.

211
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
All right, you guys.I'm taking off my shirt.

212
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
She's lying.

213
00:11:32 --> 00:11:37
Stop sending food to our apartment!

214
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Why are you dressed up?

215
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
You're not the only onewith a date.

216
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
- What? You have a date? Who with?- No one.

217
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
Come on, what's his name?

218
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
Nothing.

219
00:11:45 --> 00:11:46
Come on, tell me.

220
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
All right, but I'm very excitedabout this, okay?

221
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
So promise you won't getbig-brothery and judgmental.

222
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
I promise. What?

223
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
- It's Richard Burke.- Who's Richard Burke?

224
00:11:55 --> 00:11:56
Dr. Burke?

225
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
You have a date with Dr. Burke?Why? Why? Why...

226
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
...should that bother me?

227
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
I love that man.He's like a...

228
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
...a brother to Dad.

229
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
He is the brightest, most sophisticated,sexiest man I've ever been with.

230
00:12:10 --> 00:12:11
Dr. Burke is sexy?

231
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
Oh, God! Absolutely!

232
00:12:15 --> 00:12:16
Damn!

233
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
It's the museum again.Can I...?

234
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
- Dr. Burke kissed me once.- When?

235
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
When I was 7, I crashed my bikeright out in front of his house...

236
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
...and to stop me from crying,he kissed me right here.

237
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
- Oh, you are so lucky!- I know.

238
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
Australopithecus isn't supposedto be in that display.

239
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
No, Homo habilis was erect.Australopithecus was never fully erect.

240
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
Well, maybe he was nervous.

241
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
Oh, look!I can't believe this!

242
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,and they've got him with clay pots?

243
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
Why don't they justgive him a microwave?

244
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

245
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
It's longer than I expected.We will have dinner.

246
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
That's okay.

247
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
Karl!

248
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
Oh, God.

249
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
- Wow! Is that Michelle?- Yep.

250
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
I've not seen her sincehigh-school graduation.

251
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
Oh, my God, that nightshe got so dru...

252
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
Emotional.

253
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
You know, she's having another baby.

254
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
- I thought she just had one.- No, no. Henry's almost 2.

255
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
And he's talkingand everything. Here.

256
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
The other day he told me he liked mebetter than his other grandpa.

257
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
In all fairness, his othergrandpa's a drunk, but still...

258
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
You're a grandpa.

259
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
Are we nuts here?

260
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
I don't know. Maybe.

261
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
I mean, I'm dating a manwhose pool I once peed in.

262
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
I didn't need to know that.

263
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
I guess 21 years is a lot.

264
00:14:03 --> 00:14:08
I mean, hell, I'm a whole personwho can drink older than you.

265
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
So maybe we should just...

266
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
Maybe...

267
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
Wow.

268
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
This really sucks.

269
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
Yeah, it sure does.

270
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
We don't really have to decideanything right now, do we?

271
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
No, there's no rush or anything.

272
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
- Pizza delivery!- Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

273
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
I'm done.

274
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
Yeah, well, you know what?So is Sorentino's.

275
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
I'm sorry.Why don't we find someplace else?

276
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
It's late. Everything will be closed.We'll do it another night.

277
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
No, no, we won't.

278
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
We won't?

279
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
Come on.

280
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
Okay, that's dead, right?

281
00:15:14 --> 00:15:15
What are we doing?

282
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
- Do you want Cranapple or Cran-Grape?- Grape.

283
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
Okay, now...

284
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
...sit.

285
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
Oh, my God!

286
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
Earth was only...

287
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
Sorry.

288
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
So what are we looking at?

289
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
Well, you see that little clusterof stars next to the big one?

290
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
That is Ursa Major.

291
00:15:46 --> 00:15:50
- Really?- No idea. It could be.

292
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
Listen, I'm sorryI had to work tonight.

293
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
Oh, that's okay.

294
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
You were worth the wait.

295
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
And I don't just mean tonight.

296
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
You're not laughing.

297
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
This time it's not so funny.

298
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
Oh, God!

299
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
Honey?

300
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
That's okay.

301
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
What?

302
00:16:44 --> 00:16:48
Oh, no. You just rolledover the juice bo x.

303
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
Thank God!

304
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
Hey, you.

305
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
I can't believe I'm waking upnext to you.

306
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
I know. It is pretty unbel...

307
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
We're not alone.

308
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
Is that the fire alarm?

309
00:17:59 --> 00:18:03
It's not warm yet.We still have time.

310
00:18:03 --> 00:18:06
- Yeah, yeah. Cool!
