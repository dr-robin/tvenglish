00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
Hey, you guys? What areyou doing tomorrow night?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
Oh, well, let me see.I believe I'm...

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
Well, my agent hooked me upwith six tickets to a great play.

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
I could fall asleep at a play.

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
- What is it?- It's a one-woman play called:

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
A Bitter Woman 's Journey Through Life.

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
- That sounds interesting.- That does sound interesting.

9
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
To listen to a woman complain fortwo hours. I don't think it gets bet...

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
I know! I know. We can drive.We can vote. We can work.

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
What more do these broads want?

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Well, you guys will have a great time.I promise.

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
What? How come you don't have to go?

14
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
I wish I could, but I found out...

15
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
...that I have to be at work reallyearly the next day, so I can't go.

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
But take the extra ticketand invite whoever you want.

17
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
Let's see. Who do I hate?

18
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
Oh, sorry.

19
00:00:49 --> 00:00:50
- Oops, sorry.- Okay.

20
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
- Okay.- Okay. Up we go.

21
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
- Oh, gosh, okay!- All right.

22
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
Can I ask you a question?

23
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
Do you think it's possiblefor two friends to fool around...

24
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
...and not have it be a big deal?

25
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
No, I don't think that ever works.Why?

26
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
- No reason.- No, no. Rachel?

27
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
- Who do you want to fool around with?- Nobody! Forget it.

28
00:01:18 --> 00:01:19
Joey?

29
00:01:20 --> 00:01:21
Maybe.

30
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
- You can't.- Why?

31
00:01:23 --> 00:01:24
Because!

32
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
Okay, seriously, did not understanda word you just said.

33
00:01:31 --> 00:01:32
- In the hall.- Okay.

34
00:01:35 --> 00:01:36
- You wanna fool around with Joey?- Yeah.

35
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
Ever since I had that dream about him,I can't get it out of my head.

36
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
I mean, what's the big deal?People do it all the time.

37
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
Who do you know that are friendsthat just fool around?

38
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
Okay. Off the top of my head...Don and Janet.

39
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
- Who are they?- I know them from work.

40
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
- Both of them?- No, just one of them.

41
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
Which one?

42
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
I don't know.What were the names I just said?

43
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
No, Rachel, things could getincredibly complicated.

44
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
You're right. I won't do anythingwith Joey. I just thought it...

45
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,a pound of baking soda and a red onion?

46
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
What the hell are you cooking?

00:02:09 --> 00:02:11

00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
You guys won't believewhat I have to do for work today.

51
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a careerof talking about dinosaurs.

52
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
There are these two professorswho are joining my department...

53
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
...and I have to meet them hereand show them around campus.

54
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
What's bad about that?

55
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
I just know they'll bea couple of old windbags...

56
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
...wearing tweed jacketswith suede elbow patches.

57
00:03:11 --> 00:03:12
Ross?

58
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
What? These aren't suede.

59
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

60
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
You don't, by any chance,know a Ross Geller?

61
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
No.

62
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
Hi. Hi, I'm Ross Geller.

63
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
Oh, hi. I'm Professor Wheeler.

64
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
Oh, that's... That's...That's nice.

65
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
It's good to meet you.

66
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
Thank you so much for taking the timeto show me around.

67
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
No, it's no big deal.

68
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
If I weren't doing this, I'd just,you know, be at the gym working out.

69
00:03:44 --> 00:03:45
Is he gonna introduce us?

70
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
I think we're just blurry shapesto him now.

71
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
By the way,I really enjoyed your paper...

72
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
...on the connection between geographicisolation and rapid mutagenesis.

73
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
I wrote that in one night.

74
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
Twenty bucks says they're marriedwithin the month.

75
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Well, we should probably get going.

76
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

77
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
Isn't another professorsupposed to come with us?

78
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
I don't think so.

79
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
I'm pretty sure.A Professor Spafford from Cornell?

80
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
Well, he's obviously late,and the rule in my class is:

81
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
If you can't come on time,then don't come at all.

82
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
An option that many of my students use.

83
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
- Shall we?- We shouldn't wait for him?

84
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
You know what, he's a big boy.I'm sure he'll find us, okay?

85
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
- Professor Geller?- Oh, damn it!

86
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
Can 't wait for your party tonight.

87
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.

88
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
What's happening?

89
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
It's a real shame you can't make itto that one-woman show tonight.

90
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
I'd love to, but I gotta get upso early the next day.

91
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
- You know me, work comes first.- Oh, yeah, yeah.

92
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
Can 't wait for your party tonight.

93
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Stupid Jan Rogers!

94
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
You are having a party tonight?

95
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
I'm kind of having a thingfor the "Days of Our Lives" people.

96
00:05:08 --> 00:05:09
You weren't gonna tell us?

97
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
How did you thinkyou'd get away with that?

98
00:05:12 --> 00:05:13
I do it every year.

99
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
You do that every year?!

100
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
I didn't have to tell you that!

101
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers!

102
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
That's why you got us ticketsto that play, to get rid of us!

103
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
Yeah.

104
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
Last year is that why you sent usto that Medieval Times restaurant?

105
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
Yeah.

106
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
The year before that, you set up thatnighttime tour of that button factory?

107
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
I can't believe you guys wentfor that one.

108
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
Why wouldn't you invite usto your parties?

109
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
You're fine, okay? But everyone else actslike an idiot around famous people.

110
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
Well, then, so just invite me.

111
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
Please, I was trying to be nice.You're the worst one.

112
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
Joey, come on! Please, please?Let me come. I will behave. I promise.

113
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
- I will behave. Please, please, please.- Okay, fine. You can come.

114
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
But don't tell anybody else.It's up on the roof at 8.

115
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
A soap-opera roof party?!

116
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
I'm going to a soap-opera roof party!Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

117
00:06:03 --> 00:06:04
And it's out of my system.

118
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
And then my wife and I wenton a cruise to the Galapagos.

119
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
There was a seafood buffetyou wouldn't believe.

120
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
There were clams and musselsand oysters...

121
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
...and cracked crab...

122
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
...and snow crab...

123
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
...and king crab.

124
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.

125
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
So where did you getyour undergraduate degree?

126
00:06:33 --> 00:06:36
- And that's not all I'm allergic to.- Oh, it's not over.

127
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
I'm also allergic to peanutsand cashews...

128
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
...and almonds and filberts...

129
00:06:42 --> 00:06:43
So basically all nuts!

130
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
Interestingly, no.

131
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
You're kind of playing it fast and loosewith the word "interesting."

132
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
If you'll excuse me,I'm going to use the restroom.

133
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
Oh, my God!

134
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
I've lost the will to live.

135
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
- Let's ditch him.- What?

136
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
While he's still in the bathroom.I am begging you.

137
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
Okay. Okay, fine,but I just have one question for you.

138
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
When we exit, should we walk or run...

139
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
...or prance or stroll...?

140
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!

141
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.

142
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
Charlie, this is Phoebeand my sister, Monica.

143
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
- Hi.- Charlie will be joining my department.

144
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
- You're a paleontologist too?- Yeah.

145
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...

146
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
...of Renyard's new theory of speciesvariegation in segmented arthropods?

147
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
Well, I think he's a little out there,but he does have some interesting ideas.

148
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.Excuse me.

149
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
Renyard's theory of species variegation?

150
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
I saw the article on your coffee table.I memorized the title to freak you out.

151
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
So did you two have fun?

152
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
Oh, my God. She's great.

153
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
We have so much in common, and she'sjust cool, you know? And funny.

154
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
And I don't know if you've noticed,but she's a hottie!

155
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
Hi!

156
00:08:08 --> 00:08:12
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,I'm not feeling really well...

157
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
...and I don't think I'm gonna getto go to the play.

158
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
Really? What's wrong?

159
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
I don't know.I think it's kind of serious.

160
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
You know, I was watching this thingon TV this morning...

161
00:08:21 --> 00:08:24
...about Newcastle disease,and I think I might have it.

162
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
Newcastle disease isa secretion-borne virus...

163
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
...that only affects chickensand other poultry.

164
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
Okay, who's this?

165
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
I'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.She's a colleague.

166
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Hi. Well, I would shake your hand...

167
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
...but I'm sure you don't wantto get my chicken disease.

168
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
- Rachel, can I see you for a second?- Sure.

169
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
You're not sick.

170
00:08:48 --> 00:08:49
What? Yes, I am!

171
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?

172
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
When you're sick, you do whateveryou can to make yourself feel better.

173
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
You just want to stay homeso you can make a move on Joey.

174
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
No, I heard you before.That is so not what this is.

175
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
Okay, then what is this?

176
00:09:05 --> 00:09:06
Okay.

177
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
Joey is having a secret"Days of Our Lives" party up on the roof.

178
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
And he sent you guys to the playto get rid of you.

179
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
What?!

180
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
What? What's going on?

181
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
Joey is having a secret"Days of Our Lives" party up on the roof!

182
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
He didn't want you to know about it,but I came over here to tell you.

183
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
- You came to say you were sick.- All right, professor or detective?

184
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
Wait, Joey's having a party,and he wasn't gonna invite us?

185
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
He does it every year.That's why he's sending you to the play.

186
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
That's why he sent us to that medievalrestaurant and to that button factory.

187
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
And that horrible museum tour?

188
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
No, I arranged that.

189
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.Have fun.

190
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
We know about your party, Joey.

191
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
- What party?- The game's over. Take off your robe.

192
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
Okay, I mean...

193
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
Close it up! Close it up!

194
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
Nice to meet you.

195
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Hey, you made it! All right!

196
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
Glad you could make it.Thanks for coming.

197
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
- Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!- Hi.

198
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
I love you!

199
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
That's why I didn't invite you.You have to calm down, all right?

200
00:10:20 --> 00:10:21
Just get yourself a drinkor something.

201
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.My inhibitions lowered.

202
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
Oh, my God, can you believewe're surrounded by all this?

203
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
I can barely control myself.

204
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
You might want to rememberthat you're married.

205
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
Where is Chandler anyway?

206
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
Oh, my God! Chandler!

207
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
Where the hell is everybody?

208
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
Why Don 't You Like Me?

209
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
Chapter 1: My First Period.

210
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
Hey, Joey said no autographs.

211
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
But if she's getting one,I want one too!

212
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
"To Monica." And none of this"best wishes" crap. I want "love."

213
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew wasgiving me his phone number.

214
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
Oh, man! If I had knownI was coming to this party...

215
00:11:08 --> 00:11:09
...I never would've gotten married!

216
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
- It was nice to meet you.- Nice to meet you.

217
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
- Call me.- We will!

218
00:11:15 --> 00:11:19
Look at you with all the guys!I guess you've forgotten all about Joey.

219
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgottenabout Joey.

220
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
And clearly, you've forgottenabout Chandler.

221
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Please. Chandler'sthe love of my life.

222
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!

223
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
So it's probably gonna be hardfor you to leave Boston, huh?

224
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving.I just broke up with someone.

225
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Oh, so sad.

226
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
Still, it can't be easyfor you to leave Harvard.

227
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
Especially after working with a NobelPrize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.

228
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
Actually, Albie is the guyI broke up with.

229
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
- You dated Albert Wintermeyer?- Yeah.

230
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
And you called him "Albie"?

231
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
I mean, that's like callingAlbert Einstein...

232
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
Albie.

233
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

234
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
You think?I mean, you dated the guy...

235
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
...who improved the accuracyof radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!

236
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
Yes, and while that is everythingone looks for in a boyfriend...

237
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
...he had a lot of issues.

238
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
Oh, like what?

239
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.It's just that this must be...

240
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
...what regular people experiencewhen they watch "Access Hollywood."

241
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
Okay, you want the dirt?

242
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
Albie was seriously insecure.

243
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
He was really intimidated by the guyI dated before him.

244
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
Who's intimidating to a guywho won the Nobel Prize?

245
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
A guy who won two.

246
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
Two? What...?

247
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
Don't tell me you datedBenjamin Hobart?

248
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
Yeah, for three years.

249
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
Oh, my God.

250
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
Have you ever dated someonewho hasn't won the Nobel Prize?

251
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
No.

252
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
But there wasmy first boyfriend, Billy.

253
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?

254
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
No, but he did just wina MacArthur "genius grant."

255
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
What a loser.

256
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
Some more wine?

257
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
Hey, Ross. How's it goingwith Charlie?

258
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
Oh, great. After I finish my wine...

259
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
...I'm gonna blowmy average-sized brains out.

260
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
What's the matter?

261
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
She only dates geniusesand Nobel Prize winners.

262
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurantearlier today...

263
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
...I put chopsticks in my mouthand pretended to be a woolly mammoth.

264
00:13:17 --> 00:13:18
I always loved that.

265
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
Of course you would!Your brains are smaller than mine!

266
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
I can't compete with the guysshe goes out with.

267
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
They're so out of my league.

268
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
Oh, my God!

269
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
- Worse?- Oh, much, much worse.

270
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
I did my impression of Joan Riversas one of the earliest amphibians.

271
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
"Can we walk?"

272
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
- Oh, you like that?- No.

273
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
What?

274
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
Come on! I think that's funny!

275
00:13:42 --> 00:13:44
Woolly mammoth.

276
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
It's good!

277
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
I bet you're thinking that now would bea great time for an intermission, huh?

278
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
Oh, yes. God, yes.

279
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
Well, you're not gonna get one!

280
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
Because in life, there areno intermissions, people!

281
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
Now, Chapter 7:Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!

282
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
How could he leave me?!

283
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
I don't know. You seem lovely.

284
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.

285
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
- Nice to meet you.- So, what show are you on?

286
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
I'm not an actor.I'm a professor of paleontology.

287
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
That's science.

288
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
Hey, well, listen,I play a scientist on "Days."

289
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
Yeah, my character just wona Nobel Prize.

290
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
Dirk was wondering about the womanyou brought and if you two are together?

291
00:14:36 --> 00:14:37
Well, no, but...

292
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
I mean, she only goes outwith really, really smart guys.

293
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.

294
00:14:44 --> 00:14:45
I'd lead with that.

295
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.

296
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
Monica!

297
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
Don't worry, Joe.I won't come next year!

298
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
What the...?

299
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
What do you got there?

300
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
Just some boys gave metheir phone numbers.

301
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
Oh, really? Let me see.

302
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
Damn, that's a lot of guys.

303
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
Are you a little slutty?

304
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
I think I am.

305
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
Let me see if I approveof any of these clowns.

306
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
- This guy wears a rug.- Well...

307
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
This guy's Canadian.

308
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?

309
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
Lt'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,and I don't feel any different.

310
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Pass. Pa... Oh, pass. Pass.

311
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
- Why? What's wrong with these guys?- Well, nothing major.

312
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
It's just that, you know,they're not really good enough for you...

313
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
...and you deserve the best.

314
00:15:35 --> 00:15:36
Joey, you're so sweet.

315
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
It's true, but it doesn't matter. I alreadyknow who you're going home with.

316
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
Who?

317
00:15:44 --> 00:15:45
Me.

318
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47
What?

319
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
Really?

320
00:15:49 --> 00:15:51
Yeah, because we live together.It's a joke! It's a joke.

321
00:15:52 --> 00:15:53
Right! That's funny! I get it!

322
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
- Got you!- You're funny, Joey.

323
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
Oh, my God.

324
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
So how did you enjoy the play?

325
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
Oh, my God.Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.

326
00:16:09 --> 00:16:10
You should be.

327
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
You missed the most powerfulthree hours in the history of the theater.

328
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
- You really liked it?- Oh, yeah. I mean, at first I hated it.

329
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
But why wouldn't I? Because as a man,I've been trained not to listen!

330
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
But after Chapter 16:Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...

331
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
...I was uplifted.

332
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
- Oh, really?- Oh, yeah.

333
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
I had no idea the amazing journeyyou go through as a woman.

334
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
Tell me...Tell me about your first period.

335
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
No!

336
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Did somebody sign your bra?

337
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
So I got it when I was 13.Very difficult.

338
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
Hey, Ross? So listen,about you and the dinosaur girl?

339
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
Are you really just gonna leta couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?

340
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
What is that?Come on, a piece of paper?

341
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
It's actually a million-dollar prize.

342
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
Go, Charlie!

343
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
But my point is...

344
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
...okay, so she dated them,but she also broke up with them.

345
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
Maybe she's looking to, you know,slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.

346
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
Yeah, maybe, and I do havemy whole career in front of me.

347
00:17:13 --> 00:17:14
I mean...

348
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
I could still win a Nobel Prize.

349
00:17:17 --> 00:17:22
Although the last two papersI've written were widely discredited.

350
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
You're so much more than just brains.You are sweet and kind and funny.

351
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
And sexy.

352
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
Okay, well, give her a chanceto see all that.

353
00:17:32 --> 00:17:33
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

354
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
- Thanks. I'm gonna go find her.- Good for you.

355
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
Your paper on punctuated equilibriumin the Devonian Era was topnotch.

356
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
Stop going through my stuff!

357
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
I just wanted to let you knowI've changed my mind.

358
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
I'm gonna do it.I'm gonna kiss Joey.

359
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
No! You can't!Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

360
00:17:52 --> 00:17:53
Please! What about you and Chandler?

361
00:17:53 --> 00:17:56
That's different.I was drunk and stupid.

362
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
Well, hello?

363
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
What about all the guys that you gotthe phone numbers from?

364
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
- Why don't you just kiss one of them.- I could...

365
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
...but I don't want to.I want to kiss Joey.

366
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
All right. I think it's a big mistake,but it's your decision.

367
00:18:14 --> 00:18:15
I'm gonna do it.

368
00:18:15 --> 00:18:17
- And I can't stop you?- No.

369
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
Hey, Rach, have you seenCharlie anywhere?

370
00:18:35 --> 00:18:37
I'm smarter than him!

371
00:18:42 --> 00:18:44
Hey, thank you so muchfor these tickets, Chandler.

372
00:18:44 --> 00:18:48
This was a really important experiencefor me. I wanted to share it with you.

373
00:18:48 --> 00:18:49
You're so wonderful.

374
00:18:50 --> 00:18:52
Why Don 't You Like Me?

375
00:18:53 --> 00:18:56
Chapter 1: My First Period.

376
00:18:58 --> 00:19:00
I can't believe you guys bought that.Enjoy your slow death.
