00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Hello!

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
What's this?

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
Oh, right!It's that girl's phone number.

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
There it is.Just a phone number...

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
...a really hot girl gave me.

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
No big deal. I mean,it is her home phone number but...

7
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Almost lost this baby!

8
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
The lovely Amanda gives me her number,and I go and drop it.

9
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
Thank you.

10
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
The One withJoey's New Girlfriend

00:01:26 --> 00:01:29
- When's your birthday?- May 5th. Why?

12
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
I'm making a list of birthdays.

13
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
- Mine's December...- Yeah, whatever.

14
00:01:37 --> 00:01:38
She's pretty!

15
00:01:38 --> 00:01:41
Pretty, pretty girl. The pretty...She's pretty.

16
00:01:42 --> 00:01:43
Go ask her out.

17
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
- What's the worst that could happen?- I could die.

18
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
Yeah, it's tough being single.

19
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.

20
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
Ross, you guys went out once.

21
00:01:54 --> 00:01:59
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese,and you didn't even kiss her.

22
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
I tell people secrets.

23
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
It makes them like me.

24
00:02:09 --> 00:02:10
Phoebe.

25
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
You're sick.You shouldn't play. Go home.

26
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
But I'm unemployed.

27
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
My music is all I really have now.

28
00:02:16 --> 00:02:21
Well, music and making my own shoes.Pretty, huh?

29
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
All right, I'll do it.

30
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
I'll go get shot down.

31
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
Any advice?

32
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
Just be yourself...

33
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
...but not too much.

34
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
Wish me luck.

35
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
Good luck!

36
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
Wish it!

37
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
I was just sitting over there and...

38
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
My name's Chandler.Did I say that?

39
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
No, you didn't.Hi, I'm Kathy.

40
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
- Kathy with a "K" or a "C"?- With a "K".

41
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
Wow, you are really good at this!

42
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
I'm out on a limb here!

43
00:02:56 --> 00:02:57
I'm sorry.You're right.

44
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
But I should tell youI'm waiting for a date.

45
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
And there he is now!

46
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
I see you guys already met.

47
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
I was trying to demonstrate...

48
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
...how I could get myvery large feet...

49
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
...into my even bigger mouth.

50
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
Didn't I tell you?

51
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
Always showing off.

52
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
Before I start, I want to saythat I have a cold.

53
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
So if I sneeze during a song,it's not on purpose.

54
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
Except the last verse of"Pepper People".

55
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
Smelly cat, smelly cat

56
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
What are they feeding you?

57
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
This chick sounds good.

58
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
Smelly cat

59
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
Gunther, be a good little boyand bring me a whiskey.

60
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expectto fight over the remote.

61
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacsthing I wanted to watch.

62
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
That's why I got up too.

63
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
You're kidding?I love him!

64
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
Sorry about this afternoon.If I'd known, I wouldn't have...

65
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
Oh, please.

66
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
Joey tells me you two metin acting class.

67
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
We were partners.Joey picked three scenes for us.

68
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
All of them had us making out.

69
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
That's good, because he used tomake me rehearse with him.

70
00:04:21 --> 00:04:22
Is it on?

71
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!

72
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
Oh, my God!

73
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
It's on!

74
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
Here we go, little fella.

75
00:04:39 --> 00:04:40
What about the duck?

76
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
The duck can swim.

77
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
My sticky shoes

78
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
My sticky, sticky shoes

79
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Why you stick on me?

80
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
Baby

81
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Thanks for the lights, honey.

82
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
Way to go!

83
00:05:01 --> 00:05:02
Your cold makes you sound great.

84
00:05:03 --> 00:05:07
It's fun.God, I love how sexy I am!

85
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
Kath, we should get going.We're going to buy hamsters.

86
00:05:12 --> 00:05:13
I love them.

87
00:05:13 --> 00:05:18
No, it's not like that.I work for a medical researcher.

88
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
Have fun.

89
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
It's nice thatthe medical community...

90
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
...is trying to help sick hamsters.

91
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
You know what?I like Kathy.

92
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
Me too!She's so cool and pretty.

93
00:05:30 --> 00:05:31
She is.

94
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
She's smart and funny.

95
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
We were up all last night talking.She said the funniest thing about...

96
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
What?

97
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
You love her.

98
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
No, I don't.

99
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
Yes, you do.Chandler loves Kathy.

100
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
- Come on, just lay off him.- Thank you.

101
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
He's a little sensitive right nowbecause he's so in love!

102
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
All right.

103
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
Kathy, I love you!

104
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
I need to write some depressing stufffor my new bluesy voice.

105
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
But nothing sad hasever happened to me.

106
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
How about your mom dying?

107
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
Or living on the streetswhen you were 14?

108
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
I could write about whenmy hair did that woo-hoo thing.

109
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.

110
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
Rachel's not here.

111
00:06:31 --> 00:06:32
How's it going with her?

112
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
Great, actually. I'm thinkingtonight may be the night.

113
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
The kids will play together,and when they're asleep...

114
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
...Amanda and I breakopen a bottle of wine...

115
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
...do a little playing ourselves.

116
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
Hi, guys! This is Josh.

117
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
Josh, these are my friends.

118
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
And that's Ross.

119
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Dudes.

120
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
You played in college?

121
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
I still do.Next year, I hope to make varsity.

122
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
Didn't you play soccerin high school?

123
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
No, wait. You organized theirgame schedules on your Commodore 64.

124
00:07:06 --> 00:07:11
It's getting late. I got to getto the game, so I'll... head.

125
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
I'll miss you.

126
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
Dope!

127
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Wow! Cute one.

128
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
- Very cute.- I know. Isn't he great?

129
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
So nice to finally be in afun relationship, you know?

130
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
There's nothing boring about him.

131
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
I bet he's never set footin a museum.

132
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
Maybe he'll get to go soon.

133
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
Like on a class trip or something.

134
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
You know what else isgreat about him?

135
00:07:39 --> 00:07:40
What's the word for an adult...

136
00:07:40 --> 00:07:44
...who has no dinosaur toysin their bedroom?

137
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
What was that?

138
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
Monica knows.

139
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
It's this dumb thing Ross made upto fool our parents.

140
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
It's a way of giving the fingerwithout actually giving it.

141
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
I cried the night you made that up.

142
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
It was the first time I realizedI was cooler than my big brother.

143
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
I'm going to go get ready...

144
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
...for my date tonight...

145
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
...so I'll just "head".

146
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
I should go too.I'm playing in one hour.

147
00:08:21 --> 00:08:22
You guys should come hear me.

148
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24
Hear me.

149
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
My sticky shoes

150
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
I lost my sexy phlegm!

151
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
Hi, Ben.

152
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
- You look great!- Thanks.

153
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
Hey, Tommy!

154
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
I'm so glad you could come tonight.

155
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.

156
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
My cell phone numberis on the counter.

157
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
Help yourself to the fridge.

158
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
I appreciate this.I've been trying to date...

159
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
...this guy for a month.

160
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
I'd appreciate itif you'd drink your wine...

161
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
...after the kids are asleep.

162
00:09:05 --> 00:09:09
Thanks for this. I hope I can dothe same for you sometime.

163
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
Who wants to makesome long-distance calls?

164
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
Chandler, what are you doing here?

165
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
I just wanted to say, "hey!"

166
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
You're making it soundworse than it was.

167
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
Her date tipped me $10!

168
00:10:18 --> 00:10:19
What are you doing?

169
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
I want to be sexy again,so I'm trying to catch a cold.

170
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
Should be easy.They're pretty common.

171
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
You'll catch pneumonia!

172
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
You were right.I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.

173
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
- What?- Are you serious?

174
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
How's that possible?You barely know her.

175
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
I don't know. I just...

176
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
I can't get her out of my head.

177
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
I'm a very bad person.I'm a very, very bad person.

178
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
I'm a horrible person.

179
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
"No, you're not.We still love you, Chandler!"

180
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.

181
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
You mean you stole it!

182
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
Don't cover your mouthwhen you do that!

183
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
We were just talking about you.

184
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
Really?

185
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
The time you got drunkand fell asleep...

186
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
...with your head in the toilet.

187
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
Right in there!

188
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
Ninety-nine...

189
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
...a hundred.Ready or not, here I come!

190
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
Let's go over the conceptone more time.

191
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
You want to get some dinnerwith me and Kathy tonight?

192
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
You know what?I already ate.

193
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
It's 4:30.

194
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
I had a big meal on Monday.

195
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
So that'll get mestraight through the week.

196
00:11:37 --> 00:11:41
I see what's going on here.

197
00:11:41 --> 00:11:42
You do?

198
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
You don't like Kathy.

199
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
You got me.

200
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
You've been avoiding hersince we started dating.

201
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
I made an effort to like Janice.

202
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
Now you make an effort to like Kathyby going out with us. Right?

203
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
Yeah, right.

204
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
Good. And hey, my treat.

205
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
Because you're not eating, right?

206
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
Right.

207
00:12:04 --> 00:12:07
Ross isn't here.

208
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
Stop it!

209
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
I'll see you at the party?

210
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
Beer's fear, man! 24/7!

211
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
I am so going to marry that guy.

212
00:12:23 --> 00:12:24
What?

213
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
I think he's stealing from me.

214
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
Why?

215
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
Because he's stealing from me!

216
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
Hi, it's me.

217
00:12:31 --> 00:12:32
And soup.

218
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
I saw Josh. He looked yummyin your leather jacket.

219
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
I don't eat chicken,so it's just noodle soup.

220
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
There's no chicken in the broth,so it's really noodle water.

221
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
- Thank you so much.- Sure.

222
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
What are you doing?

223
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
I need your germs.I want my cold back.

224
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
I miss my sexy voice.

225
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
Sorry, Phoebe.

226
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
It's okay.

227
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
How's the soup?

228
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
Check it out!You can see that girl's underwear.

229
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
Is she great, or what?

230
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
What do you think?

231
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
She's not really my type.

232
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
Not your type?She's gorgeous.

233
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
You know what it is?The fishnet stockings.

234
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
Whenever I see a girl in those,it reminds me of...

235
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
...my father in fishnet stockings.

236
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
Understanding a little more ofwhy you're single.

237
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
I have a friend you'd like.We could double date.

238
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
No, thanks.

239
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
I've got some ugly friendswho are available too.

240
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
I'm going to grab a beer.

241
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
I'll be right back.

242
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
What was that?

243
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
Kathy's being really niceand you walked away.

244
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
What do you want from me?

245
00:14:02 --> 00:14:03
I want you to like her.

246
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
If that's too damn difficult,then at least you could pretend.

247
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
I am pretending.

248
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
Then do it better.

249
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
What do you say, I go tell herhow much I like her?

250
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
I could tell herI've been thinking of her.

251
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
I haven't stopped thinkingof her since we met.

252
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
I'm so over-the-top,want-to-slit-my-own-throat...

253
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
...in love with her,that every minute...

254
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
...I can't believe my own damn bad luckthat you met her first!

255
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
That's pretty good.

256
00:14:29 --> 00:14:33
But you might wantto tone it down a little.

257
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
Amanda just dropped me off.

258
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
That's one of the thingsI love about her.

259
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
She's old enough to drive.

260
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
You're not goingto Mom and Dad's tonight?

261
00:14:47 --> 00:14:48
No. Sorry.

262
00:14:49 --> 00:14:50
Where's Amanda?

263
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
Get me some cough drops.

264
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
I'm thinking you could bring her...

265
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
...and go to your old roomand not make out.

266
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
Cough drop, please?

267
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
At least she's notgoing out with me...

268
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
...to get into R-rated movies.

269
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
Why don't you marry her?

270
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
Wait, you can't! I forgot.She's not a lesbian.

271
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
Amanda and I...

272
00:15:12 --> 00:15:13
You have nothing!

273
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
You're not even going out!You're her babysitter.

274
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!

275
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Oh, that is so sad.

276
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
What are you laughing at,Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...

277
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
...- is-stealing-from me?

278
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
So he stole a few bucks.Big deal!

279
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
He got me something with it.

280
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
That's mine!

281
00:15:42 --> 00:15:45
Would you both pleasestart acting like adults?

282
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
And give me my cough drops!

283
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
- Fine.- Sorry.

284
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
Here.

285
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
Thank you.

286
00:15:54 --> 00:15:57
At least I made $10 in my relationship.

287
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
You know...

288
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
Parading goats are parading

289
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
Parading down the street

290
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
Parading goats are parading

291
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
Leaving little treats

292
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
Does it even workwithout my sexy voice?

293
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
I like it.

294
00:16:19 --> 00:16:20
Gunther, kiss me.

295
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
What?

296
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
Do something!

297
00:16:39 --> 00:16:43
We aren't exactly sleeping in here,but do you mind?

298
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
Can I sleep on your couch?

299
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
And I'm still waiting

300
00:17:01 --> 00:17:05
For my papier-mâché man

301
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
Thank you, my babies.

302
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
Did you hear what happenedbetween me and Phoebe?

303
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
We kissed. I didn't initiate it,but I also didn't stop it.

304
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
I've been feeling guilty.

305
00:17:27 --> 00:17:28
So...

306
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
...are we cool?

307
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
I knew you would understand.
