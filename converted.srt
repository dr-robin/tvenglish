00:00:01 --> 00:00:01
I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:01 --> 00:00:02
Previously on "Friends"...

4
00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
I tracked down Marcel. And get this:

5
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.

6
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
Hey, buddy! Marcel!

7
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
Excuse me, this is a...

8
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
Closed set. We know.But we're friends with the monkey.

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
Good morning.

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
Look who I brought!

11
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!

12
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
Whoa, dude. Burn!

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:31
I don't get it.

14
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
He seemed so happyto see me yesterday.

15
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
Don't take it personal. He's underpressure, starring in a movie and all.

16
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
How big of a star is Marcel?

17
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
In human terms? I'd say...

18
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
...Cybill Shepherd.

19
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
So you guys in the movieor you just really paranoid?

20
00:00:51 --> 00:00:52
Hey, Sal?

21
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
Jerry wants to knowif the monkey's ready.

22
00:00:54 --> 00:00:54
Excuse me?

23
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
Jerry is the director?Which one's he?

24
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
- The one in the director's chair?- Gotcha.

25
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
Pheebs, walk with me.

26
00:01:03 --> 00:01:04
Why am I walking with you?

27
00:01:04 --> 00:01:07
We're just going over hereso that we can get away from...

28
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

29
00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
For the love of God, woman,listen to me!

30
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
Is he looking? Is he looking?

31
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
The One With the Super Bowl, Part 2

32
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
English Subtitles byGELULA & CO., INC.

33
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
- We've got a problem.- Tell me.

34
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
I can't do Chris' makeup.

35
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
She refuses to acknowledgeher mustache.

36
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
- Is it bad?- It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

37
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
Unless we convince herto let me bleach it...

38
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
...Van Damme will bemaking out with Gabe Kaplan.

39
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
I'll talk to her.

40
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
I hate actors.

41
00:02:14 --> 00:02:19
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,I almost didn't see you.

42
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
Excuse me.

43
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
Is your name Chandler?

44
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
Yes, it is.

45
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
Chandler Bing.

46
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
Do you know me or are youjust really good at this game?

47
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
I'm Susie Moss.

48
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Fourth grade? Glasses?

49
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
I carried a bo x ofanimal crackers like a purse?

50
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
Susie Moss!

51
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Right! Yeah! Wow!

52
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
You look...

53
00:02:41 --> 00:02:42
Great job growing up.

54
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
It's nice to see you don't stillwear the cap with the mirrors on it.

55
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
I graduated fourth gradeand realized I wasn't a pimp.

56
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
Remember the class play?

57
00:02:51 --> 00:02:56
You pulled up my skirt and theentire auditorium saw my underpants?

58
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Yes. Back then, I used humoras a defense mechanism.

59
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

60
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
- Oh, my God!- What? What?

61
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

62
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
I didn't know he was inthis movie. He is so hot!

63
00:03:11 --> 00:03:12
You think?

64
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
The Muscles from Brussels?Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?

65
00:03:15 --> 00:03:16
Did you see "Time Cop"?

66
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
No. Was he any good in it?

67
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
Rachel, he totally changed time!

68
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
So why don't you go talk to him?

69
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
Go tell him he's cute.What's the worst that could happen?

70
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
He could hear me.

71
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
- I'm doing it for you.- Don't you dare! Don't!

72
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
Don't!

73
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
Tell him I cook!

74
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
Excuse me.

75
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
This is gonna sound kind of goofy...

76
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
...but my friend over there...

77
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
...who cooks, by the way...

78
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
She thinks you're cute.

79
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
You don't think I'm cute?

80
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
I don't know.

81
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
Do you think you're cute?

82
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
We're getting off the track.I was supposed to tell you...

83
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
...my friend thinks you're cute.

84
00:04:00 --> 00:04:01
What should I tell her?

85
00:04:01 --> 00:04:06
You can tell herI think her friend is cute.

86
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
- Makeup!- That's me. I gotta go.

87
00:04:16 --> 00:04:21
How many times must I touch you onthe arm before you ask me on a date?

88
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
Well, let's try one more.

89
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

90
00:04:27 --> 00:04:28
I'll be there.

91
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
And if things go well,maybe this time...

92
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
...I'll get to see your underwear.

93
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
No one was around to hear that?

94
00:04:43 --> 00:04:44
So what'd he say?

95
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
What a jerk!

96
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
I kept talking about you,and he kept asking me out.

97
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
Naturally, you know, I said no.

98
00:04:55 --> 00:04:56
Thanks, anyway.

99
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
He just kept asking...

100
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
...and asking, asking, asking...

101
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
If you want to go outwith him, you can.

102
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
Sounds like a jerk to me, but...

103
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
Jean-Claude, she said yes!I'll see you tonight!

104
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
Thank you.

105
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
Then Jean-Claude took meto Crossroads...

106
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
...and we hung outwith Drew Barrymore.

107
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
Oh, man. She's so smokin'!

108
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
She's got the greatest set of...

109
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
No guys around, huh?

110
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
- Does anybody need anything?- I'll have an espresso.

111
00:05:32 --> 00:05:32
I'll get it.

112
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
If I ask you to, you'll end updrinking it yourself.

113
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
- That is so unfair.- I know.

114
00:05:39 --> 00:05:44
Like you'd drink her coffee afterwhat you did to her with Van Damme?

115
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

116
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
Marcel's trainer will let mehave him for a couple of hours.

117
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
You're blowing me off for a monkey?

118
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
We can reschedule for Saturday.

119
00:05:52 --> 00:05:56
Unless you hook upwith a bunch of pigeons.

120
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
Stick a fork in me...

121
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
...I am done!

122
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
Stick a fork what?

123
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
Like when you're cooking a steak.

124
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
I don't eat meat.

125
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
How do you know vegetables are done?

126
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Well, you don't.You eat them and you can tell.

127
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

128
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
I've met the perfect woman.

129
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
We're sitting on her couch,fooling around...

130
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
...and then she turns to me and says:

131
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
"Did you ever want to do itin an elevator?"

132
00:06:23 --> 00:06:24
What did you say?

133
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
I believe my exact words were...

134
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
How do you know if you wanna do that?

135
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
You just know.

136
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
We gotta go.Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

137
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
What I had planned shouldn't takemore than two, three minutes, tops.

138
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
Two hundred seconds of passion!We gotta go.

139
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
But...

140
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
...here's an idea.

141
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
Have you ever worn women's underwear?

142
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
Well, yes, actually...

143
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
...but they were my Aunt Edna's.

144
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
And there were three of us in there.

145
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
I was thinkingit would be kind of sexy...

146
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
...if you wore mine tonightat dinner.

147
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
You want me to wear your panties?

148
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
Could you?

149
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
If I was wearing your underwear...

150
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
...then what would you be wearing?

151
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
You're swell!

152
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
I made Marcel's favorite dish,banana cake...

153
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
...with mealworm.

154
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
Candle.

155
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
What do you think'sgonna happen here tonight?

156
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Hi, are you on your way over...

157
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
No, I understand.A monkey's gotta work.

158
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
It's no big deal.

159
00:07:56 --> 00:08:01
It's not like I hadanything special planned.

160
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
Rachel, why don't youstart talking first?

161
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
I feel that this istotally unjustified.

162
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
She gave me the green light,I did nothing...

163
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
Do you think I can'tsee you in the TV set?

164
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
If there's somethingyou'd like to share...

165
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
You had no right to date him!

166
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
- That's the most ridiculous...- You sold me out!

167
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
- I did not!- You absolutely...

168
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
Would you let me talk!

169
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
Did you just flick me?

170
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
Well, you wouldn't let mefinish and I was...

171
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
That hurt!

172
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
Quit flicking!

173
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
Stop flicking!

174
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
You flicked me first!

175
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
Let's not do this!

176
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Happy thoughts!

177
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

178
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
All right. Now, I willlet go if you both stop.

179
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
You want me to stop seeing him?

180
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
You want me to just tell himyou're seeing him instead?

181
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
Is that what you want?

182
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
That's what you want?

183
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
- Fine!- Fine!

184
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
There we go.

185
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
If we were in prison,you guys would be, like, my bitches.

186
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
Thanks for letting me tag along.

187
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
Forget about it.

188
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
How you doing there, squirmy?

189
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
I'm hanging in.

190
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
And a little out.

191
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
So assistant to the director?

192
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
That's an exciting job. You musthave a ton of responsibilities...

193
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
I don't do the casting.

194
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
So what are you guys gonna eat?

195
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
How come all I can think about isputting that ice in my mouth...

196
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
...and licking you all over?

197
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
Because I went to an all-boys highschool, and God is making up for it?

198
00:10:20 --> 00:10:21
I want you right here...

199
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
...right now.

200
00:10:23 --> 00:10:24
Right now, right here?

201
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
Don't you think we're inkind of a public place?

202
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
They do have the shrimp.

203
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
Meet me in the bathroom.

204
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
I'm going to the bathroom now.

205
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
Come on.

206
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
All right, mister.

207
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
Let's see those panties.

208
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
Alrighty.

209
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
But you know whatwould be even sexier?

210
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
What?

211
00:11:03 --> 00:11:07
If you didn't haveyour shirt tucked into them.

212
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
All right. Now, I would liketo see you wearing nothing but them.

213
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
Take your clothes off.

214
00:11:14 --> 00:11:19
I hope you realize this meanswe'll miss hearing about the specials.

215
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
Come on, hurry!

216
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
Do you want this done quickor done right?

217
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
All right, turn around.I wanna see you from behind.

218
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
Somebody's been doinghis "Buns of Steel" video.

219

222
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43

223
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44

00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
That was in fourth grade!How could you still be upset?

230
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
Call me in 20 years and tell meif you're still upset about this.

231
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
I hope you realize you're notgetting these underpants back!

232
00:12:18 --> 00:12:19
I can't believe this.

233
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
Just two weeks ago,I was watching "Sudden Death"...

234
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25

00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
- Can you beat up that guy?- Sure.

237
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
This is so wild.

238
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
I gotta admit, I was surprisedthat you agreed to go on a blind date.

239
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
Normally, I would not do it.

240
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
What made you makethe exception for me?

241
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43

242
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46

255
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
You don't have the guts.

256
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chickento tell some guy he was cute.

257
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
Stop! Stop the madness!

258
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
This is crazy!

259
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
Who can remember whyyou're fighting in the first place?

260
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
Yes, that's right.

261
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
But still...

262
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56

267
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
...throw out your purse.

268
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

269
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
I'm sorry I went out with himwhen I knew you liked him.

270
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

271
00:14:35 --> 00:14:35
Joey?

272
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
Ma?

273
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
What are you doing here?I thought you guys took off.

274
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
She took off with my clothes!

275
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
- Are you naked in there?- Well, not exactly.

276
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
I'm wearing panties.

277
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
You always wear panties?

278
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
No, no. This is the first time.

279
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
Talk about your bad luck!

280
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
The first time you try panties andsomeone walks off with your clothes.

281
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
I was not trying them out.Susie asked me to wear them.

282
00:15:11 --> 00:15:12
Let me see!

283
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
No! I'm not letting youor anybody else see, ever!

284
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
All right, all right!

285
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
Someone's flossing!

286
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
Joey, some people don't like that.

287
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
Chandler's wearing panties.

288
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33

289
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
- Let me see!- You don't have to see!

290
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
Hi, tushy!

291
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
One of you give me your underpants.

292
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
I'm not wearing any.

293
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
How can you not be wearing any?

294
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
I'm getting heat from the guyin the hot pink thong.

295
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55

296
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18

297
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21

00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
Marcel just finished his last scene,if you wanna go say goodbye.

302
00:16:37 --> 00:16:42
That's okay. He's probablygot parties to go to and stuff.

303
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
He's moved on.That's the way it goes, right?

304
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
Oh, my God!

305
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
What?

306
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56

00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
I think I want to writea song about all this.

315
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
Except one of the stringson my guitar is broken.

316
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35

317
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
