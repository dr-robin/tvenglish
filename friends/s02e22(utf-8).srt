00:00:01 --> 00:00:01
I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
I'll get candles andmy mom's lace tablecloth.

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
And since it's Rachel's birthday...

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
...I thought I'd poach a salmon.

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:13
What?

7
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
Question. Why do we alwayshave parties where you poach things?

8
00:00:17 --> 00:00:18
You want to be on the food committee?

9
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
Question 2. Why do we alwayshave parties with committees?

10
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
Why can't we just get pizzaand beer and have fun?

11
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
I agree. Fancy parties are only funif you're fancy on the inside.

12
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
And I'm not sure we are.

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
You don't want it to be special?

14
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
Fine. You can throwany kind of party you want.

15
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
Joey, they're not real!

16
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
I start miles beneath the surfaceof these things. They're fake.

17
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
See?Honk, honk!

18
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
Wow, it's like porno for clowns!

21
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.

22
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
I still have to invite Dylanand Emma and Shannon Cooper.

23
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33
No Shannon Cooper.

24
00:01:33 --> 00:01:34
Why not her?

25
00:01:35 --> 00:01:35
Because she...

26
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
She steals stuff.

27
00:01:39 --> 00:01:44
Or maybe she doesn't and Joey sleptwith her and never called her back.

28
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
Joey, that is horrible.

29
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
Hey, I liked her.

30
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
Maybe too much.

31
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
I don't know.

32
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
I guess I just got scared.

33
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

34
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
I didn't think anyonewould buy that. Okay!

35
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
Hi, honey.How did it go?

36
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
It was the graduation from hell.

37
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
My cousin went to hellon a football scholarship.

38
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.

39
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
Nobody thought my sisterwould graduate from college.

40
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
It's a testament to what a girlfrom Long Island will do for a Celica.

41
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
What happened?

42
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
My parents happened.

43
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
All they had to do was sitin the same stadium, smile...

44
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
...and not talk about the divorce.But no!

45
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
They got into a fightduring the commencement address.

46
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
Bishop Tutu actuallyhad to stop and shush them.

47
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
You know the good news?

48
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
I get to serve coffeefor the next eight hours.

49
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
I guess we don't invite her parents.

50
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
- How about just her mom?- Why her mom?

51
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Because I already invited her.

52
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Did you ask Stacy Roth?

53
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
Can't invite her.

54
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
She also steals.

55
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
Here are the candles.Where's the birthday cake?

56
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
We're not having birthday cake.

57
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
We're having birthday flan.

58
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
Excuse me?

59
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
It's a traditionalMexican custard dessert.

60
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
That's nice.

61
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
Happy birthday, Rachel.Here's some goo!

62
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
Dr. Greene!

63
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
Oh, my God!It's Rachel's dad.

64
00:03:15 --> 00:03:16
Why are you here?

65
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
The father can't seethe daughter on her birthday?

66
00:03:19 --> 00:03:20
No, no, the father can.

67
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
But since I am the roommate,I can tell you she's not here.

68
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
And I'll pass along the message.Okay? So bye-bye.

69
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
You're having a party.

70
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
No, no, not a party.

71
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
Just a surprise gatheringof some people Rachel knows.

72
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
- This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.- I'll never remember all that.

73
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
So what's the deal?

74
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
Rachel comes home, people pop outand yell stuff? Is that it?

75
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
This isn't your firstsurprise party, is it, sir?

76
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
Hi, Monica.

77
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
The Chinese menu guy.Forgot the menus.

78
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

79
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
Dr. Greene, come with me.We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

80
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
All right.That sounds like a two-person job.

81
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
Well, my goodness!What was that?

82
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
Sandra, I thought you were Rachel.We weren't ready for you yet.

83
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
- You thought I was Rachel?- Yes, because you look so young.

84
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
And because you're both,you know, white women.

85
00:04:19 --> 00:04:24
Oh, I missed you kids.Should I put my coat in the bedroom?

86
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
- No, I'll take that for you.- Oh, well, thank you.

87
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
Such a gentleman.Thank you.

88
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
It all looks so nice.So festive. All the balloons.

89
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
Oh, the funniest thing happenedto me on the way here.

90
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
- I was driving...- That's great!

91
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
I can't wait to hear the rest,but I have to go to the bathroom.

92
00:04:46 --> 00:04:47
Hey, come with me.

93
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
- What?- It will be like we're gal pals.

94
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
You know, like at a restaurant.It'll be fun! Come on.

95
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.Oh, my God!

96
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
Think. Think.

97
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

98
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
Okay, now that your coatis safely in the bed...

99
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
We can come back outin the living room.

100
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
Joey and Chandler, it's timeyou take Dr. Greene over to your place.

101
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
Yes, absolutely.

102
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
Why, again?

103
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
Because that's wherethe party is, you goon!

104
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
- See, this is just the staging area.- Right, it's the staging area.

105
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
This is clearlyin the wrong apartment.

106
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
All right, you guys are offto party number one.

107
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
And you...

108
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
You are off to party number two.

109
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
All right, let's keep it moving,let's keep it moving.

110
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
At least send some women to my party.

111
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
Okay, that's Ross. All right.

112
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
Okay, they're coming.

113
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.

114
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
Thanks for being born.

115
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
Thank you for my beautiful earrings.They're perfect.

116
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
I love you.

117
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
Now, you can exchange themif you want, okay?

Surprise!

120
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Oh, my gosh!

Oh, my God. Mom!

123
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
This is so great!

124
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
Happy birthday, sweetie.

125
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
You! I had no idea!

126
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
- Really?- No, I knew.

127
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
All right.

128
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
There's food and drinks on the table.

129
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
Go across the hall.Right now, Joey and Chandler's.

130
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
- Why?- Just go.

131
00:06:35 --> 00:06:35
Weird.

132

133
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

134
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
Daddy!

135
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
Both of them are here? Both of them?Both of them are here?

136
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
Well, we could count again?

137
00:06:52 --> 00:06:53
I can't believe this!

138
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
You know, this is ridiculous.

139
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
This is your birthday, your party.

140
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
Let's put them together.If they can't deal with it, who cares?

141
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
- I do.- That's who.

142
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
Are you gonna be okay?

143
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
I don't really have a choice.I can look at the bright side.

144
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
I get two birthday partiesand two birthday cakes.

145
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
Well, actually...

146
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
...just one birthday flan.

147
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
It's a traditionalMexican custard dessert.

148
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
Talk to Monica.She's on the food committee.

149
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
Some girl just walked up to meand said, "I want you, Dennis"...

150
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
...and stuck her tonguedown my throat.

151
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
I love this party!

152
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
- Quick volleyball question.- Volleyball.

153
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
We set up a court in your room.

154
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
You didn't likethat gray lamp, did you?

155
00:07:39 --> 00:07:40
A woman stuck hertongue down my throat.

156
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
I'm not even listening to you.

157
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
- Dennis!- Okay, that's me.

158
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Can you keep Dad occupied?I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.

159
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
Do you have any ideasfor any openers?

160
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
Stay clear of "I'm the guythat's doing your daughter"...

161
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
...and you should be okay.

162
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
I want you to take a piece of paper...

163
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
Here you go. And write downyour most embarrassing memory.

164
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
When you're not using the markers,put the caps back on them...

165
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
...because they will dry out.

166
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
Hi, Dr. Greene.

167
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
So how's everything in the...

168
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
...vascular surgery...

169
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
...game?

170
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
It's not a game, Ross.A woman died on my table today.

171
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
That's the good thing about my job.

173
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
All the dinosaurs on my tableare already dead.

174
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
Listen, I don't meanto be a pain about this...

175
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
...but I've noticed some of youare just placing them on.

176
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
You want to push the caps...

177
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
...until you hear them click.

178
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
Gunther!

179
00:08:42 --> 00:08:43
Where you going?

180
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
I was sort of thinking about maybe...

181
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
No! No, you can't go!No, this is fun.

182
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
We're just starting.Here's your marker.

183
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
If you want to go, just go.

184
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
She'll yell at me again.

185
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
All right, I can get you out.

186
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
What?

187
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
In a minute, I'll create a diversion.

188
00:09:05 --> 00:09:09
When I do, walk quickly to the doorand don't look back.

189
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
- I think I need a drink.- I'll get it for you.

190
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
- What do you want?- Scotch.

191
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
I'll be back in 10 seconds withyour scotch on the rocks in a glass.

192
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
Neat!

193
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
Cool.

194
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
Neat, as in no rocks.

195
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
I know.

196
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
Hello, Ross!Where have you been?

197
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
I have been in the bathroom.

198
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

199
00:09:39 --> 00:09:40
Scotch neat.

200
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
That's Rachel's father's drink.

201
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

202
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
Scotch neat.

203
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
Would you excuse me?

204
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?

205
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
I'm getting my cigarettes.

206
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
No.

207
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
What do you mean "no"?

208
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
See, because that's the staging area.

209
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
You go in there, it'll ruinthe whole illusion of the party.

210
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
Take your scotch back in there...

211
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
...and I will getyour cigarettes for you, sir.

212
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
- Get my glasses too.- All righty-roo.

213
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
What a great moment to say thatfor the first time.

214
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
Okay, the first person'smost embarrassing memory is...

215
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
..."Monica, your party sucks."

216
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
Very funny.

217
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
Oh, no! Did someone forgetto use a coaster?

218
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
What?

219
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
I don't see anything.

220
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

221
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
Ross, whose glasses are those?

222
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Mine.

223
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
You wear bifocals?

224
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
I have a condition apparently...

225
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
...that I require...

226
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
...two different sets of focals.

227
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
Do you know my husbandhas glasses just like that?

228
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
Well, those are very popular frames.

229
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
Neil Sedaka wears them.

230
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
I hear you can get people out of here.

231
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
You didn't tell meyour boyfriend smokes.

232
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
Yeah, like a chimney.

233
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Big smoker.

234
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
Big, big smoker.

235
00:11:28 --> 00:11:32
In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallwayand fire up this bad boy.

236
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
Are you wearing my glasses?

237
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
Yes.

238
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
I was just warming upthe earpieces for you.

239
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Thank you.

240
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
Is that one of my cigarettes?

241
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
Yes, it is. I was justmoistening the tip.

242
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
She's taking the trash out,so I can get you out of here.

243
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
But it has to be now.She'll be back any minute.

244
00:12:10 --> 00:12:11
What about my friend?

245
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
Only the three of you.Any more and she'll get suspicious.

246
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
- Let me just get my coat.- There isn't time!

247
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
Just leave everything.

248
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
They'll take care of you next door.

249
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
Is it true they have beer?

250
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
Everything you've heard is true.

251
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
Could you guys please keep it down?

252
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
We're trying to starta Boggle tournament.

253
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
You!

254
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
And you.

255
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
You're supposed to be at my party.

256
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
And Gunther!

257
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
What are you doing here?

258
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
Welcome to the fo...

259
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
All right, I'm sorry.But these people needed me.

260
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
They work hard all week.It's Saturday night.

261
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
They deserve to have a little fun.Go!

262
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
You know, my party is fun.

263
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
It's a little quieter,less obvious sort of fun.

264
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
But if people would justgive it a chance, it's...

265
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
- You want me to see a therapist?- Sweetheart, you have a problem.

266
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
You've chosen a boyfriendexactly like your father.

267
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.

268
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
But right now, I gotta go.I gotta go do a thing.

269
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
Did you know your motherspent $ 1200 on bonsai trees?

270
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
I felt like Gulliver.

271
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
Daddy, I really wantto hear more about this...

272
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
...but I just have to do some stuff.

273
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
You work and you workand you work at a marriage...

274
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
...but all he cares aboutis his stupid boat.

275
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
You work and you workand you work on a boat.

276
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

277
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
And you sand it and varnish it.

278
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
But when all is said and done,he still drinks out of the mugs.

279
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
and Bridges of Madison County...

280
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
- The bonsais and the Chihuahua...

281
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56
for three weeks now but...

282
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
with half a boat?

283
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
Okay, okay, you can be shirtsand I'll be skins.

284
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
I'll be skins!

285
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
How you holding up there, tiger?

286
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
Sorry. When my parents were gettingdivorced, I got a lot of "tigers".

287
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
I got a lot of "champs","chiefs", "sports".

288
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
I even got a "governor".

289
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
This is it, isn't it?This is what my life will be like.

290
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
My mom there, my dad there.

291
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

292
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
She gets the house, he's in a condomy sister will decorate with wicker.

293
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
How did you get through this?

294
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
I relied on a carefullyregimented program...

295
00:14:42 --> 00:14:43
...of denial...

296
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
...and wetting the bed.

297
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
You know, I just...It's so weird.

298
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
I mean, I was in there just listeningto them bitch about each other.

299
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
All I kept thinking aboutwas the Fourth of July.

300
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
Because it reminded you of the way...

301
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
...our forefathers usedto bitch at each other?

302
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
It's just this thing.Every year we would...

303
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
...go out on my dad's boatand watch the fireworks.

304
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
Mom always hated it becausethe ocean air made her hair all big.

305
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
My sister Jill would bethrowing up over the side...

306
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
...and Dad would be upsetbecause nobody helped.

307
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
And when we did help, he'd screamat us for doing it wrong.

308
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
But then when the fireworks started,everybody just shut up.

309
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
You know, and it'd get really cold.

310
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
And we'd all just sort ofsmoosh under this one blanket.

311
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
It never occurred to anybodyto bring another one.

312
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
And now it's...

313
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
Yeah, I know.

314
00:15:57 --> 00:15:58
I hope you had fun.

315
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
All right, I'm hitting the road.

316
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
Now, I've left my 10 verbson the table.

317
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
Be sure and send methat finished poem.

318
00:16:05 --> 00:16:06
Okay, will do. Glad you came.

319
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
- I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.- Let me go check.

320
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
Your mom wants to say goodbye.

321
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
Happy birthday, sweetie.

322
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
You drive safe.

323
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
What are you doing?

324
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
I'm getting readyfor the water skiing.

325
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
Okay, big hug. One more.Come on!

326
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
How are you?

327
00:16:32 --> 00:16:33
- Where are you going?- To get my coat.

328
00:16:33 --> 00:16:34
We'll get that for you.

329
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
All right, all right.I can get my own coat.

330
00:16:43 --> 00:16:47
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

331
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
Oh, no. No, you're notsupposed to be here.

332
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
This is the staging area.It's all wrong. You should leave.

333
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
You know, just get out.

334
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
Or perhaps you'd likea créme de menthe.

335
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
I have to be headingtoward my chateau.

336
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
I guess we're going backinto the hallway again.

337
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.

338
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
You take care.

339
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
Oh, you kids.

340
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
Well.

341
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
This is the best partyI've been to in years.

342
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
Thank you!

343
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
Okay, everybody,it's time for flan!

344
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
Yep! Get readyfor the gelatinous fun.

345
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
Looks like that stuff you getwhen you get an infection.

346
00:17:49 --> 00:17:50
Okay, that's enough.

347
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
Okay, Rachel,make a special flan wish.

348
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
Okay, I've got one.

349
00:17:58 --> 00:18:00
Heads up!

350
00:18:01 --> 00:18:05
Wow! Those things almostnever come true.
