1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
I can't believemy little brother's married!

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
Why didn't you tell meyou were eloping?

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Well, we were at court,eating lunch...

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
Why were you at court?

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
Lunch.

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
We were like...

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
...we're here, we're having lunch.Let's get married! Right?

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
A year ago, I didn't know I hada brother. Now I have a sister!

9
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
Oh, it's so great.

10
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
Stop it! Don't!

11
00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
I'll get you a gift now.

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
Is there anything you need?

13
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
We've been trying to get pregnant.Thought we'd get a jump on things.

14
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
No one's getting any younger.

15
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53
Because the thing is, we're notable to, you know, conceive.

16
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
We've seen a bunch of doctors.

17
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
They say that our only chanceto have a baby...

18
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
...is that if they take my sperm,her egg, put it together in a dish...

19
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
...and put it into another girl.

20
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
We were wonderingif you could be that girl.

21
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
That's a really nice gift.

22
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
I was thinking of a gravy boat.

23
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
The One with Phoebe's Uterus

24
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
Check it out!Guess what job I just got.

25
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
I don't know, but Donald Trumpwants his blue blazer black.

26
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
Blue blazer back.He wants it back.

27
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
You said "black". Why would hewant his blue blazer black?

28
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Well, you know what I meant.

29
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
You messed it up.

30
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
You're stupid.

31
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
So what job'd you get?

32
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
Tour guide at the museum.Ross got it for me.

33
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
Don't you have to bea dinosaur expert?

34
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
They give youall the information.

35
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
It's like memorizing a script.

36
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
On your left, tyrannosaurus rex,from the Jurassic Period.

37
00:02:37 --> 00:02:38
Very nice.

38
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
Yeah, actually, Joey,it's the Cretaceous Period.

39
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
But I can pronounce Jurassic.

40
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
Frank Jr. And Alice got married!

41
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
Oh, my God!

42
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
They're having a baby!

43
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
They want me to grow itfor them in my uterus!

44
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
- My God!- Are you serious?

45
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
You're thinking ofhaving sex with your brother?

46
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
Ew! And, oh no!

47
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
They want me to be the surrogate.

48
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
It's her egg and his sperm.I'm the oven. It's their bun.

49
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
What did you say?

50
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
I had to think about it,but what is there to think of?

51
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
I'll be giving someonethe greatest gift.

52
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
You'll carry their child,and get them a Sony PlayStation?

53
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
This is an incredible thing to do.

54
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
But there are things to think about.

55
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.I mean pregnant.

56
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
I know.

57
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
You'll put your bodythrough an awful lot.

58
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
I mean, morning sickness, labor.

59
00:03:43 --> 00:03:44
It's all for somebody else.

60
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
Yeah. What's your point?

61
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.

62
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
I couldn't do that.

63
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
I figure, the first time I had a baby,it'd be with someone I love.

64
00:03:55 --> 00:03:56
And that baby was, you know...

65
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
...a keeper.

66
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
You were more supportive whenI wanted to make denim furniture.

67
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
If you decide to do this,we'll be supportive like crazy.

68
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
Just think it through.

69
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.Like your mom.

70
00:04:09 --> 00:04:14
My mom never gave birth.Oh! But my birth mom did!

71
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
I love this tushy!Can I take it to work with me?

72
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway.It came with the pants.

73
00:04:29 --> 00:04:30
I am so jealous.

74
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
You guys are just right there.

75
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
Right where?

76
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
The beginning, whereit's all sex and talking...

77
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
...and sex and talking.

78
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
You got to love the talking.

79
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
And the sex?

80
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
We haven't had sex.

81
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
What's the big deal?This is special.

82
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
I want our love to growbefore moving to the next level.

83
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.

84
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
That is really nice...

85
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
...lying!

86
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
- No way is that the reason.- Why?

87
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
You're not mature enoughto understand that!

88
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
He's right. I'm totally lying.

89
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
Then what is it?

90
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

91
00:05:13 --> 00:05:18
And you're afraid you won'tbe able to fill his shoes?

92
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
I'm afraid I won'tmake love as well as him.

93
00:05:22 --> 00:05:23
I was going for the metaphor.

94
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
I was saying the actual words.

95
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
He's had girlfriends.It doesn't mean he's great in bed.

96
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
We share a wall.

97
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
Either he's great, or she likedto agree with him a lot.

98
00:05:37 --> 00:05:42
It'll be different. The sex will begreat because you are in love.

99
00:05:43 --> 00:05:44
Just go for it.

100
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
Yeah, you should.

101
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
All right. I'll sleepwith my girlfriend.

102
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
But I'm just doing it for you guys.

103
00:05:53 --> 00:05:58
Now, the mastodon is fromthe semi-late Jurassic Period.

104
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
Isn't the mastodonfrom the Pliocene Epoch?

105
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
This is a museum. No talking.

106
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
Right down here we have...

107
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
...a large foot.

108
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
And over here we have Ross Geller.

109
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.

110
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
Ross is one of our scientists.Look at him hard at work.

111
00:06:22 --> 00:06:23
Okay, moving right along.

112
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
Come on.

113
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
It's open. Come in.

114
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
- I'm sorry I'm late.- That's okay.

115
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
I had time to finishglazing my nipples.

116
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
You go all outwhen you're expecting company.

117
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
I was working on my pottery.

118
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
Oh! I didn't knowthat you did pot.

119
00:06:45 --> 00:06:50
Mostly nudes. It combinesmy two passions: Pottery and erotica.

120
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Erottery!

121
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Thanks for coming out to see me.

122
00:06:55 --> 00:07:00
I thought it'd be a good idea totalk about this baby stuff in person.

123
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
I don't think it's a good idea.

124
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Why not?

125
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
You'd be giving up a baby.

126
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
And I really don't...

127
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
I don't know if anything I say...

128
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
...would make you understand the painof giving up a baby.

129
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
No, no, I understand the pain.Don't hurt the puppy!

130
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
No, no. The puppy is yours.

131
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
I get a puppy?

132
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
But for only three days.

133
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
Why?

134
00:07:28 --> 00:07:33
I realize I don't have any rightto start getting parenty on you now.

135
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
Look at me and not the puppy.It's very important.

136
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
I know what I'm talking about.

137
00:07:43 --> 00:07:44
I gave up two babies.

138
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
I only wish I had someonewho'd given up babies that told me...

139
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
...how terrible it is.

140
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
It'd be something you'd regretevery day for the rest of your life.

141
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
So however hard it is for youto give up this puppy...

142
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
...it'd be a million times harderto give up a child.

143
00:08:05 --> 00:08:09
I shouldn't have given youthe puppy first.

144
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
Could you sit there? I'm savingthis seat for my friend Ross.

145
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
You mean Dr. Geller?

146
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
Doctor? I didn't knowhe had a nickname.

147
00:08:20 --> 00:08:21
Oh, he won't sit here.

148
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
Only people in white coatssit there.

149
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
Only people in blue blazerssit here.

150
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
How come?

151
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
That's how it is.

152
00:08:29 --> 00:08:30
That's crazy.

153
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
It's crazy in a perfect world:A world without lab coats and blazers.

154
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
But you not in a perfect world.You in a museum now.

155
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
See that scientist?

156
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
He and I used to play togetherin grade school, but now...

157
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
Peter! Hey, Peter!

158
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
It's me, Rhonda from P.S. 129?

159
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
I shared my pudding with you, man!

160
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
I gave you my snack pack!

161
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
See? He pretendhe don't even hear me!

162
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
Everyone's pretendingthey don't hear you.

163
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
I don't know about your jacketsand separate tables...

164
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
...but Ross is my friend.

165
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
And if I save him a seat,he will sit in it.

166
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
Here! I saved you a seat!

167
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
I'm cool here.I'll catch up with you later.

168
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
This is saved.

169
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
Gift shop.

170
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
I'm sorry aboutwhat happened today.

171
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
You do what you got to do.

172
00:09:42 --> 00:09:47
The scientists and the tour guidesnever sit together.

173
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
It's like that everywhere.Mon, back me up.

174
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
Where you work, the waiterseat with the waiters.

175
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
And the chefs eatwith the other chefs?

176
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
I eat by myself in the alley,because everybody hates me.

177
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
Look, Ross.

178
00:10:03 --> 00:10:04
It's no big deal.

179
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
You wear a white coat.I wear a blue blazer.

180
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
If that means we can't befriends at work, so be it.

181
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
I understand, you know?

182
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
When I'm in a play and you're inthe audience, I don't talk to you.

183
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
So it's, you know, it's cool.

184
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
I'll see you tomorrow.

185
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
When we're in the audience,he does wave.

186
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
Why's Phoebe singingto Karl Malden?

187
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
I think it's time for puppyto go out again.

188
00:10:40 --> 00:10:41
Come on, let's go to the balcony.

189
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
The street.Come on, let's go to the street.

190
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
Don't go on the balconyuntil after I get back.

191
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
So, did you do it?

192
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Yes, yes, we had the sex.

193
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
It was bad?

194
00:10:55 --> 00:11:00
It was fine, but she didn't agreewith me as strongly as with Joey.

195
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
She was like, "I see your point.I'm all right with it."

196
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
There's not always a lot of agreementthe first time.

197
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.Guys agree like that.

198
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Look, you have to help me.

199
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
I mean...

200
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
I know what to do with a woman.It's always nice.

201
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
I need to know...

202
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
...what makes it go from nice to...

203
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
..."My God! Somebody's killing herin there!"

204
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
I'll show you somethinga lot of guys don't know.

205
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
All right.

206
00:11:29 --> 00:11:30
Now.

207
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35
You don't have to draw an actual...Whoa, she's hot!

208
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.

209
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
You got one, two, three...

210
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
...four...

211
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
...five, six and seven.

212
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
There are seven?

213
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
Let me see that.

214
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
That's one?

215
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Kind of an important one.

216
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
I was looking at it upside down.

217
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
Well, you know sometimes that helps.

218
00:12:03 --> 00:12:08
Most guys will hit one, two, threeand then go to seven and set up camp.

219
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
That's bad?

220
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
At Disneyland, you don't spendthe whole day on the Matterhorn.

221
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
You might if it were like seven.

222
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
The important thing isto take your time.

223
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
You want to hit them all...

224
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
...mix them up.Keep them on their toes.

225
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
Oh, toes!

226
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
For some people.

227
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
All right.

228
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
You could start outwith a little one.

229
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
A two.

230
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
A one, two, three.

231
00:12:39 --> 00:12:40
A three.

232
00:12:41 --> 00:12:42
A five.

233
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
A four.

234
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
A three, two.

235
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
Two. A two, four, six.

236
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
Two, four, six.

237
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
Four. Two.

238
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
Two. Four, seven!

239
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Five, seven! Six, seven!

240
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
Seven! Seven!

241
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
Dr. Geller?There's a seat here.

242
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.

243
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
But I'm having my lunch...

244
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
...at this table.Here in the middle.

245
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
I'm eating...

246
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
...right herewith my good friend, Joey.

247
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
If he'll sit with me.

248
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.

249
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
You know...

250
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
...we work in a museumof natural history.

251
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
And yet, there is something...

252
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
...unnatural...

253
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
...about the way we eat lunch.

254
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
I look around, and you know what I see?I see division.

255
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
Division between people in white coatsand people in blue blazers.

256
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
I ask myself, "My God, why?"

257
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
Now, I say we shed these coats...

258
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
...that separate us.

259
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
And we get to knowthe people underneath.

260
00:14:11 --> 00:14:12
I'm Ross!

261
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
I'm divorced and I have a kid!

262
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!

263
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!

264
00:14:27 --> 00:14:31
I'm Ted, and I just moved here,and New York really scares me.

265
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
- There you go!- Hang in there, Teddy!

266
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
I'm Andrew.

267
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
And I didn't pay for this pear.

268
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
Okay. Good for you.

269
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
I'm Rhonda!And these aren't real!

270
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
Wow, Rhonda.

271
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
- I'm Scott.- Yeah, okay, Scott!

272
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
I flip the light switch on and off17 times when I leave a room...

273
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
...or my family will die.

274
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
My mom will be here soon.

275
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
I can't. I can't give him up.

276
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
Yes, no. I can.

277
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
I don't want to.

278
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
But I can.

279
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
I can't watch this.It's like "Sophie's Choice".

280
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
You know, I never saw that.

281
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
Oh, it was only okay.

282
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
I can't do this.

283
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
My mom was right.If I can't give him up...

284
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
...there's no wayI can give up a baby.

285
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
Frank and Aliceare going to be so crushed.

286
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
What else can I give them?A kidney!

287
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
We were in the neighborhood.

288
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
We want to let you know thatthere's still no pressure.

289
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
If there was something you wantedto say, we'll be right there.

290
00:15:50 --> 00:15:53
Who's this little guy?

291
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
He's so cute! He reminds meof my old dog, Tumor.

292
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
You are so precious,I'd take you home.

293
00:16:03 --> 00:16:04
Why don't you?

294
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
Are you serious?

295
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
Thanks.

296
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
- What are you doing?- I'm okay with this.

297
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
You know why?Because look at them.

298
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
Look how happy they are.

299
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
And I made that, so you know...

300
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
...it'll be a million times harderto give up a baby. But God!

301
00:16:24 --> 00:16:28
It'll feel a million timesbetter, right?

302
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
I'll do this.I want to carry your baby.

303
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
Thank you so much!

304
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
You don't know what this means to us.

305
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
I think I'm going to cry!

306
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
It's going to be so great.

307
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
- What's going on?- I gave them the puppy.

308
00:16:51 --> 00:16:55
It made them so happy,I decided to carry their baby.

309
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
- Phoebe...- No, I know.

310
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
We're different, though.

311
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
This is a different situation.

312
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
I am not going to regret this.

313
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
I understand all that.

314
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
It's just, that was my puppy.

315
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
Would you ever be a surrogate?

316
00:17:14 --> 00:17:15
Depends who asked.

317
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
What if I asked?

318
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
Oh, Mon, sure!

319
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
- Really?- Yes.

320
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
You're not asking me, are you?

321
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
Yes. Totally.

322
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
Thank you! Thank you!

323
00:17:33 --> 00:17:34
Thank you!

324
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
Yes, thank you!
