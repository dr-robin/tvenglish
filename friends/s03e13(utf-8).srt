17

Six dollars, please.

18



19

00:00:08.44,00:00:10.83

20

Six? I just had it for one night.[br]It's three.

21



22

00:00:11.08,00:00:14.52

23

Eight o'clock's the cutoff.[br]And, oh, it's 8:02.

24



25

00:00:16.12,00:00:18.72

26

You know, in a weird way,[br]you have too much power.

27



28

00:00:19.68,00:00:22.20

29

You have to help me[br]because I only have three.

30



31

00:00:22.92,00:00:24.80

32

I can help with that.

33



34

00:00:25.80,00:00:28.84

35

Oh, my God. Richard?

36



37

00:00:32.20,00:00:33.84

38

Your lip went bald.

39



40

00:00:36.00,00:00:37.07

41

Thanks.

42



43

00:00:39.28,00:00:40.68

44

You look great!

45



46

00:00:41.20,00:00:42.00

47

Right.

48



49

00:00:42.20,00:00:43.84

50

No, you do. You. . . .

51



52

00:00:45.80,00:00:46.60

53

What?

54



55

00:00:46.80,00:00:48.87

56

You got panties stuck to your leg.

57



58

00:00:53.00,00:00:56.88

59

I was just grabbing some things[br]out of the dryer, and static cling.

60



61

00:00:57.92,00:01:02.12

62

Or maybe God knew I'd be running into[br]you and saw an opportunity.

63



64

00:01:03.08,00:01:04.20

65

It's good to see you.

66



67

00:01:04.40,00:01:06.24

68

It's good to see you too.

76

00:01:56.80,00:01:58.84

77

See that guy?[br]He's in "Classics" now. . .

78



79

00:01:59.08,00:02:02.36

80

. . .but as soon as we leave,[br]he's going straight to the porn.

81



82

00:02:02.60,00:02:07.12

83

He'll go to the counter with Citizen[br]Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.

84



85

00:02:11.36,00:02:12.59

86

This is nice.

87



88

00:02:13.44,00:02:15.28

89

-I miss this.[br]-Me too.

90



91

00:02:16.08,00:02:18.08

92

You want to get a hamburger[br]or something?

93



94

00:02:18.32,00:02:20.28

95

I don't know if that's a good idea.

96



97

00:02:20.48,00:02:22.95

98

Just friends.[br]I won't grope you. I promise.

99



100

00:02:23.92,00:02:25.68

101

I think it's too soon.

102



103

00:02:25.88,00:02:28.32

104

No, it's not too soon.[br]I had lunch at 1 1 .

105



106

00:02:32.20,00:02:33.40

107

Yeah, baby!

108



109

00:02:34.56,00:02:37.08

110

-What are you making?[br]-Chocolate milk. Want some?

111



112

00:02:37.32,00:02:38.72

113

No, thanks. I'm 29.

114



115

00:02:40.28,00:02:41.96

116

Oh, my God! I gotta go to work!

117



118

00:02:42.20,00:02:44.48

119

What time will you get off tonight?

120



121

00:02:44.72,00:02:45.95

122

It could be really late.

123



124

00:02:46.20,00:02:47.43

125

Not again!

126



127

00:02:48.00,00:02:50.96

128

I know. I'm sorry.[br]I'll make a deal with you, okay?

129



130

00:02:51.20,00:02:53.96

131

Every night that you're asleep[br]before I get home. . .

132



133

00:02:54.20,00:02:58.08

134

. . .I will wake you up in a way[br]that has proved popular in the past.

135



136

00:02:58.28,00:03:01.91

137

Well, if you need to stay late,[br]I want to be supportive of that.

138



139

00:03:05.64,00:03:07.95

140

Look at you.[br]Since when do you rollerblade?

141



142

00:03:08.20,00:03:09.96

143

Since tomorrow.

144



145

00:03:10.76,00:03:12.24

146

I met a cute guy in the park.

147



148

00:03:12.48,00:03:15.64

149

And he jogs and blades and swims[br]and so we made a deal.

150



151

00:03:15.88,00:03:18.24

152

He's gonna teach me how[br]to do jock stuff.

153



154

00:03:20.04,00:03:22.72

155

-And what are you gonna do for him?[br]-I'm gonna let him.

156



157

00:03:22.96,00:03:23.87

158

Cool.

159



160

00:03:24.32,00:03:25.44

161

Good morning.

162



163

00:03:26.20,00:03:28.32

164

Somebody got in late last night.

165



166

00:03:28.52,00:03:31.32

167

Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

168



169

00:03:31.88,00:03:33.00

170

When did this happen?

171



172

00:03:33.84,00:03:35.72

173

Around 8:02.

174



175

00:03:36.60,00:03:40.68

176

We talked for a while, and then[br]we went out for an innocent burger.

177



178

00:03:40.92,00:03:43.31

179

There's no such thing as[br]an "innocent burger. "

180



181

00:03:44.12,00:03:46.16

182

-Gonna see him again?[br]-Tomorrow night.

183



184

00:03:46.36,00:03:48.08

185

Monica, what are you doing?

186



187

00:03:48.32,00:03:50.55

188

She spent six months[br]getting over him. . .

189



190

00:03:50.76,00:03:55.12

191

. . .and now she's celebrating that[br]by going on a date with him.

192



193

00:03:56.08,00:03:58.00

194

It's not a date, okay?

195



196

00:03:58.24,00:04:01.68

197

I'm teaching him how to make a[br]lasagna for a potluck dinner.

198



199

00:04:01.92,00:04:05.80

200

You might want to make extra, because[br]you'll be hungry after the sex.

201



202

00:04:07.92,00:04:09.72

203

We're not gonna have sex.

204



205

00:04:09.96,00:04:14.04

206

Nothing's changed here. He still[br]doesn't want children, and I still do.

207



208

00:04:14.28,00:04:16.12

209

So we're just gonna be friends.

210



211

00:04:16.36,00:04:17.96

212

Naked friends.

213



214

00:04:23.60,00:04:25.88

215

-Do you have any ice?[br]-Check the freezer.

216



217

00:04:26.12,00:04:28.51

218

If there's none in there,[br]we're probably out.

219



220

00:04:28.88,00:04:30.76

221

Are you just getting home?[br]It's late.

222



223

00:04:31.00,00:04:33.15

224

I know.[br]I had the greatest day, though.

225



226

00:04:33.40,00:04:35.87

227

I went to a meeting[br]with reps from Calvin Klein.

228



229

00:04:36.12,00:04:40.60

230

I liked a line of lingerie, so my boss[br]ordered a ton of it. And you?

231



232

00:04:41.08,00:04:45.12

233

I discovered I'm able to count all my[br]teeth using just my tongue.

234



235

00:04:49.40,00:04:52.95

236

Why do you have a copy of[br]The Shining in your freezer?

237



238

00:04:53.28,00:04:56.20

239

I was reading it last night[br]and I got scared, so. . . .

240



241

00:04:58.16,00:05:00.68

242

But you're safe from it[br]if it's in the freezer?

243



244

00:05:00.92,00:05:02.76

245

Well, safer.

246



247

00:05:02.96,00:05:04.76

248

I never start reading it. . .

249



250

00:05:04.96,00:05:07.84

251

. . .without making sure[br]we got room in the freezer.

252



253

00:05:09.00,00:05:10.80

254

How often do you read it?

255



256

00:05:11.00,00:05:13.72

257

Haven't you ever read a book[br]over and over again?

258



259

00:05:14.68,00:05:16.36

260

I read Little Women more than once.

261



262

00:05:16.60,00:05:18.67

263

It's a classic.[br]What's so great about The Shining?

264



265

00:05:18.88,00:05:22.40

266

The question should be, what is[br]not so great about The Shining?

267



268

00:05:24.16,00:05:27.16

269

And the answer would be,[br]"nothing. " All right?

270



271

00:05:27.40,00:05:29.20

272

This is the scariest book ever.

273



274

00:05:29.40,00:05:31.96

275

I bet it's better than that[br]classic of yours.

276



277

00:05:34.32,00:05:36.24

278

We'll just see about that, okay?

279



280

00:05:36.48,00:05:41.35

281

I will read The Shining,[br]and you will read Little Women.

282



283

00:05:42.12,00:05:43.92

284

All right, you got it.

285



286

00:05:44.36,00:05:47.44

287

Now, Rach, these little women. . . .

288



289

00:05:49.00,00:05:50.60

290

How little are they?

291



292

00:05:50.84,00:05:53.60

293

I mean, are they, like, scary little?

294



295

00:05:59.56,00:06:02.32

296

Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.

297



298

00:06:03.40,00:06:05.68

299

You have lipstick right here.

300



301

00:06:06.00,00:06:08.52

302

That's okay, it's mine.[br]We just kissed.

303



304

00:06:09.12,00:06:11.72

305

Isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

306



307

00:06:11.96,00:06:14.32

308

Well, I'm from California.

309



310

00:06:14.60,00:06:17.84

311

Right. Sometimes you guys[br]just burst into flame.

312



313

00:06:28.00,00:06:32.92

314

I'm up. I'm up. I've gotten up now.[br]Anybody want anything?

315



316

00:06:33.40,00:06:34.76

317

-I'll have coffee.[br]-Me too.

318



319

00:06:35.00,00:06:35.88

320

Make that three.

321



322

00:06:36.12,00:06:38.51

323

Ross, why don't you come with me?

324



325

00:06:43.36,00:06:45.36

326

What's the matter?[br]What's going on?

327



328

00:06:45.60,00:06:47.44

329

Robert's coming out.

330



331

00:06:48.08,00:06:49.76

332

What do you mean?[br]ls he gay?

333



334

00:06:55.68,00:06:57.75

335

He's coming out of his shorts.

336



337

00:07:00.32,00:07:01.72

338

What?

339



340

00:07:02.28,00:07:04.51

341

The man is showing brain.

342



343

00:07:08.60,00:07:10.99

344

Are you sure? Hold on.

345



346

00:07:12.84,00:07:14.84

347

I'm sorry.[br]That was a coffee and a. . . .

348



349

00:07:15.08,00:07:16.56

350

Coffee. We could write it down.

351



352

00:07:16.80,00:07:19.84

353

No, no. That won't be necessary.

354



355

00:07:26.00,00:07:26.80

356

Well?

357



358

00:07:29.36,00:07:30.64

359

What do we do? What do we do?

360



361

00:07:30.88,00:07:35.80

362

Well, I suppose we just[br]try to not look directly at it.

363



364

00:07:37.48,00:07:39.52

365

Like an eclipse.

366



367

00:07:43.36,00:07:46.04

368

When people compliment my[br]cooking tonight, what do I say?

369



370

00:07:46.28,00:07:50.04

371

You say, "Thank you. "[br]Then you buy me something pretty.

372



373

00:07:50.28,00:07:52.75

374

Come on, we're gonna[br]put our hands in this bowl. . .

375



376

00:07:53.00,00:07:55.72

377

. . .and we're gonna start[br]squishing the tomatoes.

378



379

00:07:56.60,00:07:59.72

380

This feels very weird.

381



382

00:08:00.48,00:08:02.68

383

You touch people's eyeballs[br]and this feels weird?

384



385

00:08:02.92,00:08:07.60

386

Sure, I touch them. But I spent years[br]learning not to squish them.

387



388

00:08:13.20,00:08:14.92

389

That's my hand.

390



391

00:08:18.08,00:08:20.92

392

-Keep squishing.[br]-The tomatoes are squishing.

393



394

00:08:23.48,00:08:25.76

395

You got some on your shirt.

396



397

00:08:26.00,00:08:27.12

398

Hold on a second.

399



400

00:08:27.96,00:08:31.88

401

Just put a little club soda on it.[br]Get to it right away.

402



403

00:08:32.12,00:08:33.92

404

It should do. . .

405



406

00:08:35.56,00:08:36.79

407

. . .the trick.

408



409

00:08:45.64,00:08:46.44

410

What?

411



412

00:08:47.96,00:08:49.36

413

You've got some on your pants.

414



415

00:08:52.80,00:08:54.72

416

I'll just throw them out.

417



418

00:09:00.40,00:09:02.32

419

These little women!

420



421

00:09:05.56,00:09:06.55

422

You're liking it?

423



424

00:09:06.80,00:09:10.04

425

Oh, yeah.[br]Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

426



427

00:09:10.28,00:09:12.40

428

I don't see how he could forgive her.

429



430

00:09:15.36,00:09:18.36

431

Jo's a girl.[br]It's short for Josephine.

432



433

00:09:19.00,00:09:21.52

434

But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

435



436

00:09:26.68,00:09:28.75

437

You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

438



439

00:09:29.00,00:09:31.68

440

That is the one thing missing[br]from The Shining.

441



442

00:09:34.52,00:09:36.56

443

No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

444



445

00:09:37.80,00:09:40.88

446

No wonder Rachel had to read this so[br]many times.

447



448

00:09:44.56,00:09:46.63

449

How'd the basketball go?

450



451

00:09:46.88,00:09:51.32

452

I learned how to shoot a lay-up,[br]a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

453



454

00:09:51.60,00:09:52.92

455

You mean a 3-pointer?

456



457

00:09:53.16,00:09:55.52

458

I get more because I'm dainty.

459



460

00:09:56.92,00:09:59.44

461

Is there a phone here[br]to check my messages?

462



463

00:09:59.68,00:10:03.60

464

-In back. Do you want a quarter?[br]-I always carry one in my sock.

465



466

00:10:15.48,00:10:18.04

467

What are you doing?[br]Get back on your side--

468



469

00:10:18.28,00:10:19.56

470

Hello!

471



472

00:10:24.52,00:10:26.12

473

I'm Joey. We haven't met.

474



475

00:10:26.36,00:10:27.72

476

Good to meet you. Robert.

477



478

00:10:31.68,00:10:32.80

479

What?

480



481

00:10:33.64,00:10:36.80

482

What? You guys, what is going on?

483



484

00:10:37.04,00:10:38.72

485

Do you not like Robert?

486



487

00:10:39.76,00:10:41.08

488

Why are you laughing?

489



490

00:10:41.32,00:10:43.20

491

Calm down.[br]No reason to get testy.

492



493

00:10:48.60,00:10:51.16

494

-You guys! Come on![br]-We're sorry.

495



496

00:10:51.68,00:10:56.60

497

It just seems that Robert isn't as[br]concealed in the shorts area. . .

498



499

00:10:57.12,00:10:58.48

500

. . .as one may have hoped.

501



502

00:10:59.72,00:11:01.32

503

What do you mean?

504



505

00:11:04.84,00:11:08.60

506

Could you pass me those cookies?

507



508

00:11:08.80,00:11:09.60

509

Sure.

510



511

00:11:15.52,00:11:17.48

512

So how'd the lasagna go over?

513



514

00:11:18.08,00:11:21.92

515

Really? Good. So you owe me three[br]pretty things.

516



517

00:11:23.80,00:11:25.72

518

I've been thinking about you too.

519



520

00:11:26.56,00:11:30.11

521

Well, no. It's hard,[br]this "platonomy" thing.

522



523

00:11:31.12,00:11:32.96

524

It's a word.

525



526

00:11:36.20,00:11:39.96

527

I do think it's better this way.[br]We're being smart.

528



529

00:11:40.20,00:11:42.12

530

Yes, I'm sure.

531



532

00:11:44.20,00:11:46.12

533

You really sure?

534



535

00:11:47.48,00:11:49.24

536

I'll call you back.

537



538

00:11:59.16,00:12:01.72

539

So we can be friends[br]who sleep together.

540



541

00:12:02.24,00:12:05.12

542

Absolutely.[br]This'll just be something we do.

543



544

00:12:05.32,00:12:07.92

545

Like racquetball.

546



547

00:12:08.88,00:12:11.11

548

Sounds smart and healthy to me.

549



550

00:12:12.32,00:12:16.24

551

So just out of curiosity. . .

552



553

00:12:16.48,00:12:19.92

554

. . .do you currently have[br]any other "racquetball" buddies?

555



556

00:12:20.88,00:12:22.95

557

Just your dad.

558



559

00:12:24.56,00:12:27.03

560

Although that's actually racquetball.

561



562

00:12:27.28,00:12:30.56

563

You know, I do have a blind date. . .

564



565

00:12:30.80,00:12:33.88

566

. . .with my sister's neighbor[br]next Tuesday.

567



568

00:12:36.52,00:12:38.32

569

Do you want me to cancel it?

570



571

00:12:38.92,00:12:40.24

572

No!

573



574

00:12:43.28,00:12:46.91

575

Because if you did,[br]that means you'd be canceling for me.

576



577

00:12:47.88,00:12:50.40

578

-And we're just friends.[br]-Exactly.

579



580

00:12:54.48,00:12:56.16

581

Oh, don't sit down.

582



583

00:12:56.40,00:12:58.00

584

-Ready to go?[br]-You bet.

585



586

00:12:58.24,00:13:00.31

587

And first, here's a gift.

588



589

00:13:04.64,00:13:06.71

590

Stretchy pants?!

591



592

00:13:07.08,00:13:11.48

593

The greatest things in the world![br]lf I were you, I'd wear them every day.

594



595

00:13:13.24,00:13:15.44

596

Gee, thank you.[br]Really, that's so nice.

597



598

00:13:15.68,00:13:19.92

599

But, to be honest,[br]I don't think I can wear these.

600



601

00:13:20.16,00:13:23.28

602

They're so tight.[br]I'd feel like I'm on display.

603



604

00:13:25.16,00:13:26.36

605

I'm sorry.

606



607

00:13:26.60,00:13:28.72

608

That's all right. I'll figure. . . .

609



610

00:13:33.56,00:13:34.39

611

How's it going?

612



613

00:13:34.64,00:13:35.92

614

Good.

615



616

00:13:36.48,00:13:37.80

617

How's The Shining?

618



619

00:13:38.00,00:13:40.36

620

Danny just went into Room 21 7.

621



622

00:13:40.56,00:13:44.08

623

The next part's the best![br]That dead lady in the bathtub--

624



625

00:13:45.36,00:13:46.64

626

You're gonna ruin it!

627



628

00:13:46.84,00:13:48.84

629

I'll talk in code.

630



631

00:13:49.08,00:13:52.44

632

Remember when the kid sees[br]those two "blanks" in the hallway?

633



634

00:13:53.32,00:13:54.88

635

Yeah, that's very cool.

636



637

00:13:55.60,00:13:59.44

638

All "blank" and no "blank" makes[br]"blank" a "blank-blank. "

639



640

00:14:01.48,00:14:02.92

641

No, the end!

642



643

00:14:03.12,00:14:05.48

644

Jack almost kills them[br]with the "blank" . . .

645



646

00:14:05.68,00:14:08.12

647

. . .but in the last second,[br]they get away.

648



649

00:14:09.00,00:14:11.00

650

I can't believe you just did that.

651



652

00:14:11.24,00:14:13.92

653

I can't believe she cracked your code.

654



655

00:14:18.56,00:14:21.95

656

Okay. Laurie proposes to Jo[br]and she says no. . .

657



658

00:14:22.20,00:14:26.40

659

. . .even though she's in love with him.[br]Then he ends up marrying Amy.

660



661

00:14:29.24,00:14:31.60

662

Mine was by accident!

663



664

00:14:33.00,00:14:36.44

665

The boiler explodes and destroys the[br]hotel and kills the dad.

666



667

00:14:38.52,00:14:39.51

668

Beth dies.

669



670

00:14:48.08,00:14:50.55

671

Beth dies?

672



673

00:14:51.88,00:14:55.56

674

Is that true?[br]lf I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

675



676

00:14:55.92,00:14:58.96

677

No, Beth doesn't die.[br]She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

678



679

00:14:59.76,00:15:01.32

680

He's asking if you've ruined. . .

681



682

00:15:01.52,00:15:04.80

683

. . .the first book he's ever loved[br]that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

684



685

00:15:08.48,00:15:11.32

686

No. She doesn't die.

687



688

00:15:11.56,00:15:13.32

689

Then why would you say that?

690



691

00:15:17.20,00:15:20.72

692

Because I wanted to hurt you.

693



694

00:15:22.56,00:15:25.12

695

Oh, there they are.[br]I dropped my keys.

696



697

00:15:27.80,00:15:29.08

698

Got them.

699



700

00:15:35.84,00:15:37.96

701

Sorry. I'm sorry.

702



703

00:15:38.20,00:15:40.24

704

You would not believe my day.

705



706

00:15:40.60,00:15:44.04

707

I had to work two shifts.[br]And then to top it off. . .

708



709

00:15:44.28,00:15:48.24

710

. . .I lost one of my fake boobs[br]in a grill fire.

711



712

00:15:51.52,00:15:52.96

713

What are you smiling at?

714



715

00:15:53.20,00:15:55.32

716

I was thinking your day[br]could still pick up.

717



718

00:16:03.40,00:16:05.24

719

I love this "friend" thing!

720



721

00:16:11.96,00:16:16.00

722

Robert's gonna be here any second,[br]so could one of you just tell him?

723



724

00:16:16.56,00:16:17.63

725

Please, right now.

726



727

00:16:17.88,00:16:21.64

728

Every time I see him, it's "Is it[br]on the loose? ls it watching me?"

729



730

00:16:23.36,00:16:24.35

731

We can't tell him.

732



733

00:16:24.60,00:16:29.52

734

You can't go up to a guy you barely[br]know and talk about his "stuff. "

735



736

00:16:29.96,00:16:33.72

737

He's right. Even if it's[br]to say something complimentary.

738



739

00:16:38.64,00:16:39.87

740

You ready for the gym?

741



742

00:16:40.08,00:16:42.96

743

There's a new rock-climbing[br]wall. We can spot each other.

744



745

00:16:44.80,00:16:47.11

746

Yeah, I can spot you from here.

747



748

00:16:50.24,00:16:51.15

749

What?

750



751

00:16:53.00,00:16:54.84

752

Listen, Robert. . . .

753



754

00:16:55.28,00:16:56.40

755

Hey, don't we have to. . .?

756



757

00:16:56.64,00:16:58.12

758

Yeah, we got. . . .

759



760

00:17:05.20,00:17:07.72

761

I think you're really, really great.

762



763

00:17:08.28,00:17:10.12

764

Oh, God. Here we go again.

765



766

00:17:10.36,00:17:14.68

767

Why does this keep happening?[br]ls it something I'm putting out there?

768



769

00:17:16.88,00:17:20.32

770

Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

771



772

00:17:23.36,00:17:25.75

773

I don't know what to say.

774



775

00:17:26.80,00:17:31.56

776

Hey, buddy? This is a family place.[br]Put the mouse back in the house.

777



778

00:17:53.88,00:17:57.51

779

Really? It's just like[br]everyone else's apartment.

780



781

00:17:57.72,00:17:59.84

782

It's got rooms and walls[br]and ceilings.

783



784

00:18:00.08,00:18:03.16

785

I just wanted to see where you live.[br]Now give me the tour.

786



787

00:18:03.36,00:18:05.00

788

Oh, my God!

789



790

00:18:05.24,00:18:07.60

791

-This is the living room.[br]-That's nice.

792



793

00:18:08.76,00:18:11.12

794

-And this is the kitchen.[br]-That's real pretty.

795



796

00:18:11.36,00:18:13.43

797

Wait a minute.[br]Don't I get to see the bedroom?

798



799

00:18:14.40,00:18:17.20

800

Well, it's pretty much your typical. . .

801



802

00:18:18.40,00:18:19.80

803

. . .bedroom.

804



805

00:18:20.80,00:18:24.43

806

We're still on this side of the door.[br]I didn't get to see it.

807



808

00:18:24.68,00:18:29.16

809

Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.[br]Thanks for a lovely evening.

810



811

00:18:46.28,00:18:48.00

812

So who is she?

813



814

00:18:48.32,00:18:51.24

815

That was the blind date[br]I told you about.

816



817

00:18:51.44,00:18:54.40

818

She called[br]and switched it from Tuesday.

819



820

00:18:56.12,00:18:57.92

821

Did you like her?

822



823

00:18:58.12,00:19:02.72

824

I'm just asking as a friend,[br]because I am totally fine with this.

825



826

00:19:05.12,00:19:06.84

827

Well, you seem fine.

828



829

00:19:07.56,00:19:10.52

830

Okay, you know what?[br]I'm not fine. I'm not.

831



832

00:19:10.76,00:19:14.31

833

I mean, how could I be fine?[br]Hearing you come in with her.

834



835

00:19:14.52,00:19:16.91

836

She wants to see your bedroom.

837



838

00:19:24.00,00:19:25.44

839

You know what?

840



841

00:19:27.68,00:19:29.72

842

What if we're friends. . .

843



844

00:19:30.52,00:19:32.36

845

. . .who don't see other people?

846



847

00:19:34.76,00:19:36.12

848

You mean "exclusive" friends?

849



850

00:19:36.96,00:19:38.28

851

Why not?

852



853

00:19:39.16,00:19:42.52

854

I mean, this has been[br]the most amazing week.

855



856

00:19:43.92,00:19:45.60

857

Would it be so terrible?

858



859

00:19:46.48,00:19:50.32

860

Even if we were friends[br]who lived together?

861



862

00:19:52.60,00:19:56.92

863

Or maybe someday, friends who stood[br]up in front of their other friends. . .

. . .and vowed to be friends forever.

867



868

00:20:06.28,00:20:08.48

869

You know, we're back where we were.

870



871

00:20:10.12,00:20:15.04

872

Honey, I would love to do all that,[br]but nothing's changed.

873



874

00:20:15.40,00:20:18.84

875

That's not true.[br]You don't have a moustache.

876



877

00:20:21.00,00:20:23.39

878

Okay, one thing's changed.

879



880

00:20:23.80,00:20:27.11

881

But we still want different things,[br]and we know how this is gonna end.

882



883

00:20:28.32,00:20:29.72

884

You know what?

885



886

00:20:30.20,00:20:32.92

887

I gotta walk out of here right now.

888



889

00:20:34.20,00:20:37.91

890

Because getting over you is the[br]hardest thing I have ever had to do.

891



892

00:20:39.80,00:20:41.68

893

I don't think I could do it again.

894



895

00:20:42.68,00:20:44.16

896

I know I couldn't.

897



898

00:20:59.40,00:21:01.71

899

How about one last[br]game of racquetball?

900



901

00:21:07.52,00:21:09.52

902

Watch the thorns!

903



904

00:21:16.40,00:21:17.20

905

What?

906



907

00:21:19.48,00:21:21.20

908

Beth is really, really sick.

909



910

00:21:26.40,00:21:30.32

911

Jo's there, but I don't think[br]there's anything she can do.

912



913

00:21:35.24,00:21:37.60

914

You wanna put the book[br]in the freezer?
