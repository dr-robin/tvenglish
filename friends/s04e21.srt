1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
All of a sudden,so much is happening.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
I know.Ross is getting married.

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
Phoebe's making people.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
- Everybody's doing stuff.- We just sit here.

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
If I died,people would know I was here...

6
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
...only by the ass printon this chair!

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
We have to do something.Something huge!

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
We could climb Mt. Everest.

9
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
Not something stupid.Something huge!

10
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
I saw an ad for this video.

11
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
People climb that thing every day.We could totally do that!

12
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
Why not?I mean, it's just climbing.

13
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
It's just steep!

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
We're going! It'd be niceto leave an ass print on Everest.

15
00:00:40 --> 00:00:41
What's up?

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
- We're gonna climb Mt. Everest.- Yeah, baby!

17
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
I looked into that.

18
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
Yeah, but it costs like $60,000,and, you know, you could die.

19
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
And you would die.

20
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
We could get that Everest video.

21
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
We could do thatwithout risking our lives at all.

22
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
While we're at the video store,we could rent "Die Hard"!

23
00:01:04 --> 00:01:05
I just remembered.

24
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
That Everest thing is only availablethrough mail order.

25
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
So you'll stay hereand hang out with me?

26
00:01:13 --> 00:01:14
But one of these days...

27
00:01:15 --> 00:01:19
...we'll get off our buttsand rent "Die Hard" again!

28
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
The One with the Invitation

29
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
So does your uncle Nathanget an invite or not?

30
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
Oh, God!Nobody likes him.

31
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
He's so cheap. He'd never flyto London in a million years.

32
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
Invite him!

33
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
Did I do these neat enough?

34
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
Yeah, they're fine.

35
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
We'll say that Ben addressed them.

36
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
You invited Rachel then?

37
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
Sure, why not?

38
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
Really?

39
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
I wouldn't be comfortable havingany of my old lovers there.

40
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
Do you thinkwe shouldn't invite her?

41
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
You know I absolutely adore Rachel.

42
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
It's just that I thoughtit might be awkward for you.

43
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
But it's absolutely your decision.

44
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
- More tea?- Sure.

45
00:02:38 --> 00:02:39
Earl Grey?

46
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
Fine, invite whoever you want.

47
00:02:45 --> 00:02:50
I don't want to be single, okay?I just want to be married again.

48
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
And I just want a million dollars!

49
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
Oh God, Monica. Thank God!

50
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
This is Rachel.Another Lincoln High survivor.

51
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
This is Chandler.

52
00:03:05 --> 00:03:06
Phoebe.

53
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
Joey.

54
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
- Do you remember Ross?- Sure.

55
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
Back in high school...

56
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
...I had a major crush on you.

57
00:03:17 --> 00:03:18
I knew.

58
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
You did?

59
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
I figured you thoughtI was Monica's geeky brother.

60
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
I did.

61
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
Listen, do you think...

62
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
Try not to let my intensevulnerability become a factor.

63
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
Would it be okayif I asked you out sometime?

64
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
Maybe.

65
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
Okay, maybe I will.

66
00:03:44 --> 00:03:45
See, I see...

67
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
...big passion in your future.

68
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
- Really?- I do.

69
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
Ross, you're so great.

70
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
It's never gonna happen.

71
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
I have a question.

72
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
Actually, it's notso much a question.

73
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
It's more of a general wondering...

74
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
...ment.

75
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
Well, for a while now,I've been wanting to...

76
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
That's right.

77
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
Look!

78
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
What?

79
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
Top of the world looking

80
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
Down on creation

81
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
And the only explanation I can find

82
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
Listen, missy! If you want this cart,you'll have to take me with it!

83
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
- Did you see that?- You were incredible!

84
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
A brand-new woman,ladies and gentlemen.

85
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
I could not have done thiswithout you.

86
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
More clothes in the dryer?

87
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
I'm fine.

88
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
You had no right to tell meyou had feelings for me.

89
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
I was doing great with Juliebefore I found out.

90
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
I was doing great too. It's noteasy for me to see you with Julie.

91
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
I don't need this right now.

92
00:05:11 --> 00:05:12
It's too late.

93
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
I'm with somebody else.This ship has sailed!

94
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
All right, fine!Go ahead and do that.

95
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
I don't need your stupid ship!

96
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
This is the first time I'm doingsomething I care about.

97
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
I'm doing somethingthat I'm actually good at.

98
00:06:04 --> 00:06:05
If you don't get that...

99
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
I get that, but I'm tiredof your answering machine.

100
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
I don't know what to do.

101
00:06:10 --> 00:06:11
Neither do I!

102
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
Is this about Mark?

103
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
Oh, my God!

104
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
Okay, it's not.

105
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
I can't keep having thissame fight over and over again.

106
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
You're making this too hard!

107
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
I am?What do you want me to do?

108
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
I don't know. Look, maybewe should just take a break.

109
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
You're right. Let's cool off.

110
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
Let's get some frozen yogurtor something.

111
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
A break from us.

112
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
- Why are we rushing?- The girlfriend I told you about.

113
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
She wants to get backtogether with me.

114
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
I found it!

115
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
That's so great for you guys!

116
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
- Good luck with your girlfriend.- Thank you.

117
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
- You got my message?- You are right on time.

118
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
Can I be your girlfriend again?

119
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
You can very much.

120
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
I want you to leave.Get out!

121
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
I want to talk about this.

122
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
All right, how was she?

123
00:07:17 --> 00:07:18
Was she good?

124
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
Don't answer!

125
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
You wanted to talk about it.How was she?

126
00:07:25 --> 00:07:25
She was...

127
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
- She was not good, not good.- Nothing compared to you.

128
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
She was different.

129
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
Good different?

130
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
Nobody likes change.

131
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Just stop!

132
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
The way you owned up to everything.

133
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
It's just showed mehow much you've grown, you know?

134
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
I mean, my mom never thoughtthis would work out.

135
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
She was all,"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

136
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
I just wish we hadn't lostthose four months.

137
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
But if time was what you neededjust to gain a little perspective.

138
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
We were on a break!

139
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
You seem to really like her.

140
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
What do I do?We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

141
00:08:20 --> 00:08:21
No commitment.

142
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
That girl just spent the entire eveningtalking to your friends...

143
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
...asking to hear stories about you...

144
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
...Iooking throughMonica's photo albums.

145
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
You don't do thatif you're just in it for two weeks.

146
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
You think?

147
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
You've got 14 hours untilshe has to be at the airport.

148
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
And you're sitting herein a hallway...

149
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
...with a 28-year-old cheerleaderwith a fat lip.

150
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
You're right.

151
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
This is so amazing!

152
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
My brother's getting marriedand in London!

153
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
It's so romantic.

154
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
Hey, pretty smart!

155
00:09:05 --> 00:09:05
Tissue paper.

156
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
You're at the wedding.You have to cry.

157
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
Handkerchief?No, I got my invitation.

158
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
Isn't this adorable?

159
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
Ross let Ben address mine.

160
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
Did you get your invitationto Ross' wedding?

161
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
Don't worry, I get to bring a guest.We'll show him.

162
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
I'm so jealous you're all going.

163
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
I never knew you can't flyin your third trimester.

164
00:09:30 --> 00:09:30
I didn't, either.

165
00:09:31 --> 00:09:32
I knew that.

166
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
So I didn't know that.But you should see your faces.

167
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
What's up?

168
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
Just hanging out.

169
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
What's this?Ross' wedding invitation?

170
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
Maybe that's the onewe should have hidden.

171
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
No, you guys, come on.You don't have to do that.

172
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
I'm happy for him.

173
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
I am. I really...

174
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
I'll work on it.

175
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
You're going to come, though,aren't you?

177
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
I don't know.

178
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
This isn't one of those"If she doesn't come, we don't come"?

179
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
Because I already bought my ticket.

180
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
You know what would be real weird?If you weren't there.

181
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
- Just say you'll think about it.- I'll think about it.

182
00:10:22 --> 00:10:23
Who's this from?

183
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
That's Ross'.

184
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
Oh, my God!

185
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
He remembered.

186
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
Remembered what?

187
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
It was months ago.We were walking by this antique store.

188
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
I saw this and told himit was like one my grandmother had...

189
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
...when I was a little girl.

190
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
I can't believe he remembered!

191
00:10:43 --> 00:10:44
This must've cost a fortune.

192
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
I can't believe he did this.

193
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
Remember when he fell in lovewith Carol...

194
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
...and got herthat expensive crystal duck?

195
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
What did you just say?

196
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
Oh, my God!

197
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
Flight number 457from Beijing now arriving.

198
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
Oh, my God!

199
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
- We were in school together.- We haven't seen each other since.

200
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
I land in China.Guess who's in charge of the dig?

201
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
Julie!

202
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
Isn't that great?

203
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

204
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
That is so sweet!

205
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
No, you hang up.

206
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
No, you...

207
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
One, two, three.

208
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
You didn't hang up!

209
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
She didn't hang up either.

210
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
No, you hang up.

211
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
You!

212
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
Ross, hi.

213
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
It's Rachel.

214
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
I'm just calling to saythat everything's fine.

215
00:12:00 --> 00:12:01
And I'm really happy for you...

216
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
...and your cat.

217
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
Obviously, I am over you.

218
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
I am over you.

219
00:12:10 --> 00:12:16
And that, my friend,is what they call closure.

220
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
I got a message from you.

221
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
Oh, my God!Hang up the phone!

222
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
Give me the phone!

223
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
You're over me?

224
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
Oh, God.

225
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
You're over me?

226
00:12:37 --> 00:12:38
When were you...

227
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
...under me?

228
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
Basically...

229
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
...lately, I've...

230
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
I've sort of had feelings for you.

231
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
I need to lie down.

232
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
He broke up with Julie!

233
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Go hug her, for God's sakes!

234
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
Really?

235
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
It's always been you, Rach.

236
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
Oh, God.

237
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
Listen, I'm sorryI had to work tonight.

238
00:13:13 --> 00:13:14
That's okay.

239
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
You're worth the wait.

240
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
And I don't just mean tonight.

241
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
Oh, God!

242
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
Honey.

243
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
That's okay.

244
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
No, you just rolled overthe juice box.

245
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
Did you say anything to Rachel aboutme and the girl from the copy place?

246
00:13:55 --> 00:13:56
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
Was I not supposed to?

248
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
You ended it!

249
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
Because I was mad at you.Not because I stopped loving you.

250
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
You still love me?

251
00:14:12 --> 00:14:17
What does this mean?Do you want to get back together?

252
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
Maybe.

253
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
I don't know.

254
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
I just, I feel...

255
00:14:30 --> 00:14:35
I can't believe I even thought ofgetting back together. We're so over!

256
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
Fine by me!

257
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
And hey! Just so you know,it's not that common.

258
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
It doesn't happen to every guy,and it is a big deal.

259
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
I knew it!

260
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
Doesn't she look pretty?

261
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
Oh, my God!

262
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
This is us getting readyfor the prom.

263
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
We don't have to watch this.

264
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
Yeah, we do!

265
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
Come on!

266
00:15:06 --> 00:15:09
- How do you zoom out?

267
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
There she is!

268
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
Shut up!The camera adds 10 pounds.

269
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
So how many camerasare actually on you?

270
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
Dad, turn it off!

271
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
It is off.

272
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
Right, Ross?

273
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
Looking good, Mr. Kotter!

274
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
It's too late.

275
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
then I don't want to go either.

276
00:15:35 --> 00:15:36
I have a wonderful idea.

277
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
You should take Rachel to the prom.

278
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
We've seen enough.Let's turn it off.

279
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
- I want to see!- Fine, I'm not going to watch.

280
00:15:43 --> 00:15:44
Come on, kid. Let's go.

281
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
Are you handsome!

282
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
Let's show them!

283
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
- Rachel, ready or not.

284
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
Here comes your knight in shining...

285
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
Oh, dear!

286
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
How do I turn this off?

287
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
I can't believe you did that.

288
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
See? He's her lobster!

289
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
You're really not going?

290
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
It's just going to be too hard.

291
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
You know, I mean...

292
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
...it's Ross.

293
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
How can I watch him get married?

294
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
It's just for the best.You know? It is.

295
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
Plus somebody's gotto stay here with Phoebe.

296
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
She's going to be pretty big by then.

297
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
She'll need someoneto help her tie her shoes.

298
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
Drive her to the hospitalif she goes into labor.

299
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
You don't have a car.

300
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
And your license expired.

301
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
There's so much to do,and I have so little time!

302
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
Check this out.

303
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
There's a place you can goto rent videos of all the museums.

304
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
"It's almost as good as being there."

305
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
It's better! You can't go to a museumin your underwear.

306
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
You could, but just the one time.

307
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
We could get videosof the sights...

308
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
...get a VCR in our hotel roomand never have to go outside!

309
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
If we do that,we've got to rent "Die Hard".

310
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
I bet the British version is good!
