-Oh, I don't know.[br]-What?

18



19

00:00:06.49,00:00:08.77

20

Well, as old as he is[br]in dog years. . .

21



22

00:00:09.01,00:00:12.32

23

. . .do you think Snoopy should[br]still be flying this thing?

24



25

00:00:12.89,00:00:13.72

26

Rachel?

27



28

00:00:13.93,00:00:14.73

29

Yeah?

30



31

00:00:14.93,00:00:18.64

32

Remember when you first came here and[br]you got trained by another waitress?

33



34

00:00:18.85,00:00:21.45

35

Sure! Do you need me[br]to train somebody new?

36



37

00:00:22.89,00:00:23.85

38

Good one.

39



40

00:00:25.01,00:00:28.77

41

Actually, Terry wants you[br]to take the training again.

42



43

00:00:29.01,00:00:29.92

44

Whenever.

45



46

00:00:33.53,00:00:35.09

47

Do you believe that?

48



49

00:00:40.53,00:00:41.44

50

Yeah.

So that's two boxes[br]of the Holiday Macaroons.

61

00:01:35.09,00:01:38.05

62

On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,[br]I salute you.

63



64

00:01:40.97,00:01:43.33

65

Just admit it. You have no backhand.

66



67

00:01:43.57,00:01:46.45

68

Excuse me, little one.[br]I have a very solid backhand.

69



70

00:01:46.69,00:01:49.77

71

Shielding your face[br]and shrieking like a girl. . .

73

00:01:50.01,00:01:51.69

74

. . .is not a backhand.

75



76

00:01:53.21,00:01:54.77

77

I was shrieking. . .

78



79

00:01:55.01,00:01:56.05

80

. . .Iike a Marine.

81



82

00:01:58.21,00:02:02.49

83

All right, watch me execute[br]the three P's of championship play.

84



85

00:02:02.77,00:02:03.81

94

00:02:11.61,00:02:13.37

95

You broke a little girl's leg?

96



97

00:02:14.01,00:02:16.13

98

I know. I feel horrible, okay?

99



100

00:02:16.37,00:02:20.33

101

It says here that a Muppet got whacked[br]on Sesame Street last night.

102



103

00:02:21.33,00:02:23.93

104

Where exactly were you around 1 0-ish?

105



106

00:02:25.69,00:02:28.53

107

I'm going to see her.[br]I wanna bring her something.

108



109

00:02:28.73,00:02:31.17

110

-What would she like?[br]-A Hello Kitty doll?

111



112

00:02:31.41,00:02:33.37

113

The ability to walk?

114



115

00:02:36.97,00:02:38.93

116

I'm gonna get back to retraining.

117



118

00:02:39.13,00:02:41.05

119

All right. See you, guys.

120



121

00:02:41.25,00:02:42.97

122

Look out, kids! He's coming!

123



124

00:02:46.09,00:02:48.05

125

I gotta go sell Christmas trees.

126



127

00:02:48.29,00:02:50.73

128

Have fun.[br]Oh, wait! No, don't!

129



130

00:02:50.93,00:02:53.93

131

I forgot. I am totally[br]against that now.

132



133

00:02:54.97,00:02:56.93

134

What? Me having a job?

135



136

00:02:57.73,00:03:01.97

137

No, I am against innocent trees[br]being cut down in their prime. . .

138



139

00:03:02.21,00:03:04.93

140

. . .and their corpses[br]grotesquely dressed. . .

141



142

00:03:05.13,00:03:07.65

143

. . .in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

144



145

00:03:08.29,00:03:10.05

146

How do you sleep at night?

147



148

00:03:10.37,00:03:13.53

149

Well, I'm pretty tired[br]from lugging the trees around.

150



151

00:03:15.93,00:03:20.37

152

You got this all wrong. Those trees[br]were born to be Christmas trees.

153



154

00:03:20.61,00:03:24.57

155

They're fulfilling their life purpose[br]by making people happy.

156



157

00:03:25.05,00:03:25.85

158

Really?

159



160

00:03:28.01,00:03:28.84

161

Yes!

162



163

00:03:30.09,00:03:32.24

164

Yes, and the trees are happy too. . .

165



166

00:03:32.49,00:03:34.56

167

. . .because for most of them,[br]it's their only. . .

168



169

00:03:34.81,00:03:36.33

170

. . .chance to see New York.

171



172

00:03:40.09,00:03:42.37

173

After you deliver the drinks,[br]take the tray--

174



175

00:03:42.61,00:03:45.97

176

Gunther, please. I have worked here[br]for two and a half years.

177



178

00:03:46.21,00:03:48.77

179

I know the empty trays go over there.

180



181

00:03:48.97,00:03:50.89

182

What if you put them here?

183



184

00:03:53.77,00:03:56.97

185

That's actually a good idea.[br]They'll be closer to the mugs.

186



187

00:03:57.21,00:03:59.57

188

You should have the other[br]waitresses do that too.

189



190

00:04:01.01,00:04:02.33

191

They already do.

192



193

00:04:03.41,00:04:05.64

194

That's why they call it the tray spot.

195



196

00:04:06.13,00:04:10.84

197

I heard them talk about that. I just[br]thought it was a club they went to.

198



199

00:04:13.01,00:04:15.32

200

-I'm sorry.[br]-It's all right.

201



202

00:04:16.97,00:04:18.29

203

Sweetheart.

204



205

00:04:21.21,00:04:24.65

206

So this must be kind of neat[br]for you, huh?

207



208

00:04:24.89,00:04:27.12

209

Your dad tells me[br]you get school off. . .

210



211

00:04:27.33,00:04:30.53

212

. . .and you don't have to sell[br]those cookies anymore.

213



214

00:04:32.01,00:04:34.13

215

I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.

216



217

00:04:34.33,00:04:36.97

218

Whoever sells the most[br]wins a trip to Space Camp. . .

219



220

00:04:37.17,00:04:39.17

221

. . .and gets to sit in a real shuttle.

222



223

00:04:39.41,00:04:43.77

224

You really like[br]all this space stuff, huh?

225



226

00:04:44.01,00:04:47.37

227

My dad says if I'd spend as much[br]time helping him clean apartments. . .

228



229

00:04:47.61,00:04:49.92

230

. . .as I do daydreaming[br]about outer space. . .

231



232

00:04:50.17,00:04:52.77

233

. . .he'd be able to afford a trip[br]to the Taj Mahal.

234



235

00:04:53.17,00:04:56.96

236

You'd have to clean a lot of apartments[br]to go all the way to lndia.

237



238

00:04:57.21,00:05:00.21

239

No. The one in Atlantic City.[br]Dad loves the slots.

240



241

00:05:02.41,00:05:05.53

242

He says he'll double the college[br]money Grandma left me.

243



244

00:05:08.13,00:05:10.33

245

Well, good luck to Dad.

246



247

00:05:12.37,00:05:16.73

248

Say, how many more boxes would you[br]have to sell in order to win?

249



250

00:05:16.93,00:05:21.01

251

The girl who won last year sold 475.

252



253

00:05:21.25,00:05:23.97

254

So far, I've sold 75.

255



256

00:05:26.61,00:05:27.97

257

Four hundred, huh?

258



259

00:05:29.09,00:05:32.33

260

Well, that sounds doable.[br]How much are the boxes?

261



262

00:05:32.53,00:05:33.60

263

Five dollars a box.

264



265

00:05:34.33,00:05:36.40

266

And what is second prize?

267



268

00:05:37.33,00:05:41.09

269

A 1 0-speed bike. But I'd rather have[br]something my dad couldn't sell.

270



271

00:05:43.77,00:05:45.13

272

Well, that makes sense.

273



274

00:05:45.61,00:05:47.76

275

Could you do me one favor?

276



277

00:05:48.01,00:05:49.53

278

Yeah, Sarah. Anything.

279



280

00:05:49.77,00:05:51.57

281

Could you pull the curtains open?

282



283

00:05:51.81,00:05:54.45

284

The shuttle astronauts[br]are gonna be on the news.

285



286

00:05:54.69,00:05:56.92

287

We don't have a Tv,[br]so the lady across the alley. . .

288



289

00:05:57.13,00:06:00.33

290

. . .said she'd push hers up[br]to her window so I can watch it.

291



292

00:06:12.49,00:06:13.56

293

Yes?

294



295

00:06:13.81,00:06:16.33

296

Hi. I'm selling[br]Brown Bird cookies.

297



298

00:06:16.57,00:06:21.05

299

You're no Brown Bird.[br]I can see you through my peephole.

300



301

00:06:22.21,00:06:25.33

302

Hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.

303



304

00:06:29.21,00:06:30.36

305

What does that mean?

306



307

00:06:30.61,00:06:35.45

308

It means that I can sell cookies,[br]but I'm not invited to sleepovers.

309



310

00:06:39.33,00:06:41.85

311

I can dial 91 1 at the press[br]of a button, you know.

312



313

00:06:42.09,00:06:43.32

314

Now, go away!

315



316

00:06:43.53,00:06:46.25

317

Please, please.[br]It's for a poor little girl. . .

318



319

00:06:46.49,00:06:49.77

320

. . .who wants to go to Space Camp[br]more than anything in the world.

321



322

00:06:50.01,00:06:51.33

323

I'm pressing.

324



325

00:06:51.53,00:06:53.41

326

A policeman is on his way.

327



328

00:06:53.65,00:06:56.21

329

Okay, okay![br]I'm going, I'm going.

330



331

00:07:01.21,00:07:02.53

332

I can still see you!

333



334

00:07:02.73,00:07:03.80

335

All right!

336



337

00:07:09.89,00:07:13.57

338

-What are you doing here?[br]-I thought a lot about what you said. . .

339



340

00:07:13.81,00:07:17.25

341

. . .and I realize maybe[br]I was a little judgmental.

342



343

00:07:17.49,00:07:19.33

344

Yeah. Oh, but, oh.

345



346

00:07:19.69,00:07:21.69

347

Now, now, Phoebe, remember. . .

348



349

00:07:22.21,00:07:24.33

350

. . .they're just fulfilling[br]their Christmas--

351



352

00:07:24.53,00:07:25.89

353

-Destiny. Yes.[br]-Sure.

354



355

00:07:29.21,00:07:31.93

356

That one doesn't look[br]very fulfilled.

357



358

00:07:32.21,00:07:35.33

359

That's one of the old ones.[br]He's just taking it to the back.

360



361

00:07:35.53,00:07:37.73

362

You keep the old ones in the back?

363



364

00:07:37.93,00:07:39.57

365

That is so ageist.

366



367

00:07:41.21,00:07:42.85

368

We're making room for the fresh ones.

369



370

00:07:43.41,00:07:45.33

371

So what happens to the old guys?

372



373

00:07:45.89,00:07:47.25

374

They go into the chipper.

375



376

00:07:48.69,00:07:51.53

377

I have a feeling that's not[br]as happy as it sounds.

378



379

00:08:08.13,00:08:10.52

380

These are shaped like[br]Christmas characters.

381



382

00:08:10.73,00:08:13.25

383

Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.

384



385

00:08:15.01,00:08:17.61

386

I'll take a box of the[br]cream-filled Jesuses.

387



388

00:08:19.17,00:08:22.37

389

One box? I'm trying to send[br]a little girl to Space Camp.

390



391

00:08:22.61,00:08:25.33

392

I'm putting you down for 5 boxes.[br]What about you?

393



394

00:08:25.57,00:08:29.09

395

All right. Do you have any[br]coconut-flavored deities?

396



397

00:08:29.93,00:08:33.81

398

No, but there's coconut in the[br]Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

399



400

00:08:34.81,00:08:37.41

401

I'll put you down for 8 boxes.[br]One for each night.

402



403

00:08:38.61,00:08:39.41

404

Mon?

405



406

00:08:39.93,00:08:42.13

407

I'll take a box of the Mint Treasures.

408



409

00:08:42.37,00:08:43.73

410

One, and that's it.

411



412

00:08:43.93,00:08:46.21

413

I gained weight after[br]I joined the Brown Birds.

414



415

00:08:46.41,00:08:50.29

416

Remember? Dad bought every one[br]of my boxes and I ate them all.

417



418

00:08:51.25,00:08:54.05

419

No, Mon. Dad had to buy[br]every one of your boxes. . .

420



421

00:08:54.29,00:08:56.13

422

. . .because you ate them all.

423



424

00:08:58.41,00:09:02.61

425

But, you know, I'm sure that's[br]not gonna happen this time.

426



427

00:09:03.21,00:09:07.57

428

Why don't I put you down for 3 Mint[br]Treasures and a couple of Rudolphs?

429



430

00:09:07.81,00:09:08.85

431

No.

432



433

00:09:11.21,00:09:13.85

434

Oh, come on, now.[br]You know you want them.

435



436

00:09:14.73,00:09:16.57

437

Don't do this.

438



439

00:09:16.81,00:09:20.93

440

I'll tell you what,[br]I'll give you the first box for free.

441



442

00:09:22.41,00:09:23.93

443

Oh, God! I gotta go!

444



445

00:09:24.13,00:09:26.65

446

Come on! All the cool kids[br]are eating them.

447



448

00:09:29.17,00:09:32.17

449

And later, I'll show you why[br]we don't just trap spiders. . .

450



451

00:09:32.41,00:09:34.93

452

. . .under coffee mugs[br]and leave them there.

453



454

00:09:38.21,00:09:42.45

455

I'm training to be better at a job[br]that I hate. My life officially sucks!

456



457

00:09:42.69,00:09:46.32

458

Wasn't this supposed to be temporary?[br]You wanted to do fashion stuff.

459



460

00:09:46.57,00:09:48.77

461

Yeah, I'm still pursuing that.

462



463

00:09:49.33,00:09:51.77

464

How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

465



466

00:09:52.01,00:09:55.72

467

Other than sending out resumes,[br]like, what? Two years ago?

468



469

00:09:56.41,00:09:59.01

470

Well, I'm also sending out. . .

471



472

00:09:59.61,00:10:01.17

473

. . .good thoughts.

474



475

00:10:02.73,00:10:05.37

476

If you ask me, as long as you[br]got this job. . .

477



478

00:10:05.61,00:10:08.13

479

. . .you got nothing pushing you[br]to get another one.

480



481

00:10:08.37,00:10:09.97

482

You need The Fear.

483



484

00:10:10.81,00:10:12.21

485

-The Fear?[br]-He's right.

486



487

00:10:12.45,00:10:16.93

488

Quit this job, and you'll have motivation[br]to go after a job you really want.

489



490

00:10:17.17,00:10:21.61

491

Why are you still at a job you hate?[br]Why don't you quit and get The Fear?

492



493

00:10:22.81,00:10:25.04

494

Because I'm too afraid.

495



496

00:10:26.81,00:10:31.68

497

I don't know. I'd give anything[br]to work for a designer or a buyer.

498



499

00:10:32.57,00:10:34.85

500

I just don't want to be 30[br]and still work here.

501



502

00:10:35.09,00:10:39.37

503

Yeah, that'd be much worse than[br]being 28 and still working here.

504



505

00:10:41.93,00:10:45.93

506

Remind me to review with you which[br]pot is decaf and which is regular.

507



508

00:10:47.37,00:10:49.73

509

Can't I just look at the handles[br]on them?

510



511

00:10:49.93,00:10:51.25

512

You would think.

513



514

00:10:52.21,00:10:56.13

515

Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?[br]I am a terrible waitress.

516



517

00:10:56.37,00:11:00.05

518

Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?[br]Because I don't care.

519



520

00:11:00.61,00:11:03.61

521

I don't care which pot[br]is regular and which pot is decaf.

522



523

00:11:03.85,00:11:05.53

524

I don't care where the tray spot is.

525



526

00:11:05.77,00:11:08.61

527

I just don't care.[br]This is not what I want to do.

528



529

00:11:10.01,00:11:12.37

530

So I don't think I should do it anymore.

531



532

00:11:14.09,00:11:16.37

533

-I'm giving my week's notice.[br]-What?

534



535

00:11:16.61,00:11:17.73

536

Gunther, I quit.

537



538

00:11:20.41,00:11:23.13

539

Does this mean we have to start[br]paying for coffee?

540



541

00:11:28.41,00:11:29.69

542

Okay, 1 2.

543



544

00:11:30.53,00:11:31.76

545

Twenty-two.

546



547

00:11:32.41,00:11:33.56

548

Eighteen.

549



550

00:11:38.41,00:11:39.21

551

What?

552



553

00:11:39.41,00:11:41.13

554

I spelled out "boobies" .

555



556

00:11:45.49,00:11:49.04

557

Put me down for another box[br]of the Mint Treasures, okay?

558



559

00:11:49.41,00:11:51.13

560

Where are the Mint Treasures?

561



562

00:11:52.57,00:11:54.49

563

We're out. I sold them all.

564



565

00:11:55.05,00:11:55.93

566

What?

567



568

00:11:56.81,00:11:58.93

569

Monica, I'm cutting you off.

570



571

00:12:04.53,00:12:06.17

572

Just a couple more boxes.

573



574

00:12:08.05,00:12:10.28

575

It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

576



577

00:12:12.17,00:12:14.73

578

You gotta help me[br]with a couple more boxes!

579



580

00:12:15.81,00:12:18.17

581

Look at yourself.[br]You have cookie on your neck.

582



583

00:12:18.73,00:12:19.61

584

Oh, God!

585



586

00:12:22.57,00:12:25.45

587

-So how many you sold so far?[br]-Check this out.

588



589

00:12:25.69,00:12:29.73

590

-Five hundred and seventeen boxes![br]-Oh, my God! How did you do that?

591



592

00:12:29.97,00:12:32.04

593

The other night I was leaving[br]the museum. . .

594



595

00:12:32.29,00:12:36.33

596

. . .just as Laser Floyd was letting out[br]of the planetarium.

597



598

00:12:36.73,00:12:39.33

599

Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes!

600



601

00:12:39.57,00:12:43.01

602

That's when it occurred to me.[br]The key to my success: The munchies.

603



604

00:12:44.77,00:12:49.13

605

So I started hitting the NYU dorms[br]around midnight.

606



607

00:12:51.01,00:12:53.53

608

I am selling cookies by the case.

609



610

00:12:54.29,00:12:57.33

611

They call me "Cookie Dude" !

612



613

00:12:59.41,00:13:03.17

614

Stop what you're doing. I need[br]envelope stuffers, stamp lickers. . . .

615



616

00:13:03.41,00:13:06.93

617

-Who did these resumes for you?[br]-Me. On my computer.

618



619

00:13:07.17,00:13:08.93

620

You sure used a large font.

621



622

00:13:09.21,00:13:12.13

623

Yeah. Well, "Waitress at[br]a Coffeehouse" . . .

624



625

00:13:12.33,00:13:15.33

626

. . .and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain"[br]only took up so much room.

627



628

00:13:17.01,00:13:18.29

629

Hey, that's funny!

630



631

00:13:18.53,00:13:20.97

632

You're funny, Chandler![br]You're a funny guy!

633



634

00:13:21.21,00:13:22.97

635

You know what else is funny?

636



637

00:13:23.61,00:13:26.05

638

Something else I might have said?

639



640

00:13:26.89,00:13:30.13

641

I don't know. Weren't you the guy[br]that told me to quit my job. . .

642



643

00:13:30.37,00:13:33.13

644

. . .when I had absolutely[br]nothing else to do?

645



646

00:13:36.65,00:13:38.13

647

Calm down. It's gonna be okay.

648



649

00:13:38.33,00:13:41.57

650

No, it's not gonna be okay.[br]Tomorrow is my last day. . .

651



652

00:13:41.81,00:13:43.69

653

. . .and I don't have a lead.

654



655

00:13:44.17,00:13:46.37

656

You know what?[br]I'm just gonna call Gunther. . .

657



658

00:13:46.61,00:13:48.33

659

. . .and tell him I'm not quitting.

660



661

00:13:48.57,00:13:50.93

662

You don't want to give in to The Fear.

663



664

00:13:51.13,00:13:54.33

665

You and your stupid Fear![br]I hate your Fear!

666



667

00:13:54.57,00:13:56.85

668

I would like to take[br]you and your Fear--

669



670

00:13:57.09,00:13:59.24

671

Hey! I got great news!

672



673

00:13:59.49,00:14:01.72

674

Run, Joey! Run for your life!

675



676

00:14:03.77,00:14:07.21

677

What? Rach, listen. Have you ever[br]heard of Fortunata Fashions?

678



679

00:14:08.45,00:14:11.73

680

My dad's got a plumbing job there[br]and he heard there's an opening.

681



682

00:14:11.97,00:14:13.77

683

You want him to get you an interview?

684



685

00:14:14.01,00:14:17.77

686

Oh, my God, yes! I would love that![br]That's so sweet, Joey.

687



688

00:14:18.17,00:14:19.13

689

Not a problem.

690



691

00:14:19.33,00:14:21.56

692

And now, for the great news.

693



694

00:14:21.81,00:14:23.37

695

That wasn't the great news?

696



697

00:14:23.61,00:14:25.41

698

Only if you think[br]it's better than this.

699



700

00:14:26.09,00:14:27.41

701

Snow-in-a-Can!

702



703

00:14:29.21,00:14:31.33

704

You want me to decorate the window?

705



706

00:14:31.53,00:14:33.37

707

Give it kind of a Christmas looky?

708



709

00:14:33.81,00:14:35.17

710

Christmas cookie?

711



712

00:14:40.57,00:14:42.77

713

Okay, and this one here's[br]a Douglas fir.

714



715

00:14:43.01,00:14:46.25

716

Now, it's a little more money,[br]but you get a nicer smell.

717



718

00:14:47.33,00:14:48.93

719

Looks good. I'll take it.

720



721

00:14:49.17,00:14:51.32

722

Wait, wait. No, no![br]You don't want that one!

723



724

00:14:51.57,00:14:54.45

725

No, no. You can have[br]this cool brown one.

726



727

00:14:56.09,00:14:57.89

728

It's almost dead.

729



730

00:14:58.49,00:15:02.04

731

That's why you have to buy it,[br]to fulfill its Christmas destiny.

732



733

00:15:02.29,00:15:05.53

734

Otherwise, they'll throw it[br]into the chipper. Tell him.

735



736

00:15:06.53,00:15:10.13

737

Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill[br]their Christmas destiny. . .

738



739

00:15:10.33,00:15:12.13

740

. . .are thrown in the chipper.

741



742

00:15:13.37,00:15:16.45

743

I think I'm gonna look around[br]a little bit more.

744



745

00:15:17.21,00:15:21.05

746

You gotta stop doing this.[br]I'm working on commission here!

747



748

00:15:22.69,00:15:24.73

749

I'm here to pick out[br]my Christmas tree.

750



751

00:15:24.93,00:15:27.97

752

Well, look no further![br]This one's yours!

753



754

00:15:30.81,00:15:33.33

755

Is this the one[br]that I threw out last year?

756



757

00:15:34.69,00:15:38.69

758

Never mind![br]Everybody wants a green one!

759



760

00:15:38.89,00:15:42.44

761

I'm sorry. I didn't mean[br]to get so emotional.

762



763

00:15:42.89,00:15:44.69

764

The holidays are just hard.

765



766

00:15:45.01,00:15:48.40

767

Oh, honey. Is that because[br]your mom died around Christmas?

768



769

00:15:48.65,00:15:50.88

770

I wasn't even thinking about that.

771



772

00:16:00.01,00:16:02.93

773

Hi there.[br]How many did you sell?

774



775

00:16:03.13,00:16:07.13

776

I'm not gonna tell you. You're the[br]bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

777



778

00:16:08.93,00:16:11.21

779

Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

780



781

00:16:11.57,00:16:12.61

782

You're a big scrud.

783



784

00:16:14.73,00:16:16.13

785

What's a scrud?

786



787

00:16:16.33,00:16:18.33

788

Why don't you look[br]in the mirror, scrud?

789



790

00:16:20.49,00:16:23.29

791

I don't have to.[br]I can just look at you.

792



793

00:16:25.09,00:16:26.13

794

All right, girls. . .

795



796

00:16:27.33,00:16:28.65

797

. . .and man.

798



799

00:16:29.97,00:16:32.12

800

Let's see your final tallies.

801



802

00:16:33.17,00:16:34.05

803

Debbie.

804



805

00:16:35.45,00:16:38.65

806

Three hundred and twenty-one[br]boxes of cookies. very nice.

807



808

00:16:39.17,00:16:40.69

809

Not nice enough.

810



811

00:16:41.89,00:16:43.01

812

Charla.

813



814

00:16:43.25,00:16:45.13

815

Two hundred and seventy-eight.

816



817

00:16:45.37,00:16:47.13

818

Sorry, dear, but still good.

819



820

00:16:47.49,00:16:49.29

821

Good for a scrud.

822



823

00:16:52.69,00:16:54.13

824

Yes, Elizabeth.

825



826

00:16:55.09,00:16:57.29

827

Eight hundred and seventy-one.

828



829

00:16:57.49,00:16:58.81

830

That's crap!

831



832

00:17:02.57,00:17:04.13

833

Sister Brown Bird.

834



835

00:17:05.09,00:17:06.24

836

Good going.

837



838

00:17:09.01,00:17:10.65

839

Who's next?

840



841

00:17:15.21,00:17:16.89

842

-Hi there.[br]-Hi.

843



844

00:17:18.29,00:17:20.29

845

And batting for Sarah. . .

846



847

00:17:21.09,00:17:22.57

848

. . .Ross Geller.

849



850

00:17:23.49,00:17:25.72

851

Eight hundred and seventy-two.

852



853

00:17:27.61,00:17:31.69

854

Although, it looks like you bought[br]an awful lot of cookies yourself.

855



856

00:17:32.01,00:17:35.25

857

That is because my doctor[br]says that I have. . .

858



859

00:17:35.49,00:17:37.45

860

. . .a very serious. . .

868

00:17:45.29,00:17:47.93

869

Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

870



871

00:17:49.21,00:17:53.33

872

I lost. Some little girl loaned[br]her uniform to her 1 9-year-old sister. . .

873



874

00:17:53.53,00:17:58.16

875

. . .who went down to the U. S. S. Nimitz[br]and sold over 2000 boxes.

876



877

00:18:00.13,00:18:03.05

878

-How'd the interview go?[br]-Oh, I blew it.

879



880

00:18:03.29,00:18:05.33

881

I wouldn't have even hired me.

882



883

00:18:06.17,00:18:07.16

884

Come here, sweetie.

885



886

00:18:07.41,00:18:08.48

887

Listen. . .

888



889

00:18:08.81,00:18:13.49

890

. . .you're gonna go on, like,[br]1 000 interviews before you get a job.

891



892

00:18:17.49,00:18:20.33

893

That's not how that was supposed[br]to come out.

894



895

00:18:20.57,00:18:22.85

896

This is just the worst Christmas ever.

897



898

00:18:23.09,00:18:26.05

899

Maybe you should just[br]stay here at the coffeehouse.

900



901

00:18:26.29,00:18:30.17

902

I can't. It's too late. Terry already[br]hired that girl over there.

903



904

00:18:30.41,00:18:31.45

905

Look at her.

906



907

00:18:31.69,00:18:34.53

908

She's even got waitress experience.

909



910

00:18:35.01,00:18:36.61

911

Last night she was. . .

912



913

00:18:37.01,00:18:38.85

914

. . .teaching everybody[br]how to make. . .

915



916

917

. . .napkins. . .

920

. . .into. . . .

921



922

00:18:45.17,00:18:46.69

923

That word was "swans. "

924



925

00:18:51.49,00:18:55.93

926

Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet[br]himself really perked up my Christmas.

927



928

00:19:03.85,00:19:05.13

929

Oh, my God!

930



931

00:19:06.01,00:19:07.33

932

Merry Christmas!

933



934

00:19:08.81,00:19:10.96

935

You saved them![br]You guys!

936



937

00:19:11.21,00:19:13.01

938

Oh, God, you're the best!

939



940

00:19:13.25,00:19:16.37

941

Looks like Night of the[br]Living Dead Christmas Trees.

942



943

00:19:20.97,00:19:22.09

944

Yeah, this is she.

945



946

00:19:24.73,00:19:26.69

947

You're kidding! You're kidding!

948



949

00:19:27.37,00:19:29.21

950

Oh, thank you! I love you!

951



952

00:19:29.41,00:19:31.61

953

Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

954



955

00:19:31.93,00:19:33.33

956

I got the job!

957



958

00:19:33.53,00:19:35.76

959

That's great.

960



961

00:19:36.13,00:19:38.89

962

God bless us, everyone!

963



964

00:19:41.37,00:19:45.21

965

Here we go. I'm serving[br]my last cup of coffee.

966



967

00:19:52.37,00:19:53.44

968

There you go.

969



970

00:19:53.69,00:19:54.89

971

Enjoy.

972



973

00:19:58.01,00:20:00.16

974

-Should I tell her I ordered tea?[br]-No.

975



976

00:20:01.89,00:20:03.04

977

Excuse me, everyone?

978



979

00:20:04.33,00:20:06.40

980

This is my last night working here. . .

981



982

00:20:06.65,00:20:09.37

983

. . .and I just wanted to say. . .

984



985

00:20:09.61,00:20:11.76

986

. . .that I made some good friends here.

987



988

00:20:12.01,00:20:14.57

989

And it's just time to move on.

990



991

00:20:18.29,00:20:21.17

992

And no offense to everybody[br]who still works here. . .

993



994

00:20:21.41,00:20:24.72

995

. . .but you have no idea how good[br]it feels to say. . .

996



997

00:20:24.93,00:20:27.32

998

. . .that as of this moment. . .

999



1000

00:20:27.53,00:20:32.13

1001

. . .I will never have[br]to make coffee again.

1002



1003

00:20:32.33,00:20:34.97

1004

Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.[br]Iikes his coffee strong.

1005



1006

00:20:35.21,00:20:38.41

1007

So you want to use two bags[br]instead of one.

1008



1009

00:20:38.65,00:20:41.25

1010

Now, pay attention.[br]This part's tricky.

1011



1012

00:20:41.73,00:20:44.77

1013

See, some people use filters[br]just once. . . .

1014



1015

00:20:53.81,00:20:56.37

1016

I'm sorry you didn't get to go[br]to Space Camp. . .

1017



1018

00:20:56.61,00:21:01.48

1019

. . .and I'm hoping that maybe somehow[br]this may help make up for it. Okay?

1020



1021

00:21:02.09,00:21:03.37

1022

Presenting. . .

1023

1026



1027

00:21:11.57,00:21:13.33

1028

You don't have to do this.

1029



1030

00:21:13.53,00:21:15.49

1031

Oh, come on, here we go!

1032
