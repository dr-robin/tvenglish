I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
Chandler, Mon, there's only onebanana-nut muffin left.

4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
I ordered mine first.

5
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:09
Give it to me.

7
00:00:10 --> 00:00:10
No.

8
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
Give it to me!

9
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
Okay, you can have it.

10
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

11
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
That was there when I got here.

12
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Hey, you'll never guesswho's coming to New York.

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
Quick, tell us before he swallows.

14
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
Ryan, that guy I datedwho's in the Navy.

15
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
You went out with a guy in the Navy?

16
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
I met him while playing guitarin the park.

17
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
Ryan threw in saltwater taffybecause he didn't have change.

18
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
Saltwater Taffy Man?

19
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
No, he's my submarine guy.He resurfaces every couple years...

20
00:00:49 --> 00:00:51
...and we have an amazingthree days together.

21
00:00:51 --> 00:00:56
Only this time, he's coming for 2 weeks.Two whole weeks, which means "yea"!

22
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
So this guy goes downfor, like, two years at a time?

23
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

24
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
Hi.

25
00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
Oh, no. What happened?

26
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
I just spoke to Carol.Ben's got chickenpox.

27
00:01:12 --> 00:01:13
Oh, no.

28
00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
Yeah, so if you haven't had it,chances are you'll get it.

29
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
- I've had it.- I've had it.

30
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
- Had it.- Had it.

31
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
I've never had it. I feel so left out.Oh, look!

32
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26

34
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
Honey, you made the bed again.

35
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
I told you, you don't have to do that.This isn't camp.

36
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
Then I guess the panty raid last nightwas totally uncalled for.

37
00:02:15 --> 00:02:19
I'm taking a shower. Today I'llsing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown".

38
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

39
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
Is Leroy the baddest manin the whole damn town...

40
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
...or the fattest man?

41
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
The baddest. Otherwise, the songwould be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown".

42
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
What are you doing?

43
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

44
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
Are you remaking the bed?

45
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
I'm sorry. The way you did it,it was just fine.

46
00:02:51 --> 00:02:52
Then you're redoing itbecause...?

47
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
You'll think I'm crazy.

48
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
You're pretty muchrunning that risk either way.

49
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
Okay. You see...

50
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
...the duvet tag shouldn't beat the top left corner...

51
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
...it should be at thebottom right corner.

52
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
- That's not so crazy.- I'm just easing you in.

53
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
All right.

54
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
You see these little flower blossoms?

55
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
They should be facing up not down...

56
00:03:13 --> 00:03:17
...because the head of the bedis where the sun would be.

57
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
You don't love me anymore, do you?

58
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
Actually, if it's possible,I love you more.

59
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Really?

60
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
Wow. Well, then, come on!

61
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
I wanna show you how to foldthe toilet paper into a point.

62
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
If you need somethingto hold you over...

63
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
...I can get you a job hereas an entry-level processor.

64
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
Don't you need experience?

65
00:03:41 --> 00:03:42
It's not hard to learn.

66
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
As for people realizing you don't knowwhat you're doing, you're an actor.

67
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
Act like a processor,people will think you're a processor.

68
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
Here's this morning's projections.

69
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
Thanks.Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

70
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
Joey is a fellow processor.

71
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
No kidding?

72
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
I process. People want the processing,I'm the one they call.

73
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
- Where do you work?- Well, I'm in between things.

74
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
You know, one day you're processing,the next day...

75
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
...you're not so muchprocessing anymore.

76
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
I told Joey about the openingin Fleischman's group.

77
00:04:15 --> 00:04:16
Fleischman's group.

78
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
Whatever you do,don't touch his sandwiches.

79
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
Are all you processors dorks?

80
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
This lipstick looks just great on you.

81
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
You look fabulous.You really do.

82
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Yeah, are you sure?Really?

83
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
See, you look beautiful.For God sakes, dim the lights.

84
00:04:41 --> 00:04:42
I'm hideous!

85
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
It's gonna be okay.

86
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
Ryan's been underwater.

87
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
He's just gonna be glad you don'thave barnacles on your butt.

88
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
Come in.

89
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
Hey, baby, I'm back...

90
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

91
00:05:05 --> 00:05:06
What's going on?

92
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
No, no.You have to stay back.

93
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
I have the pox!

94
00:05:12 --> 00:05:13
Chicken or small?

95
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
Chicken, which is so ironicconsidering I'm a vegetarian.

96
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
- Why aren't you home in bed?- My grandmother's never had chickenpox.

97
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
Please tell me you have, becauseoh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

98
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
I'm sorry, I never had them.

99
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
If I had one wish,I'd go back to when I was 7...

100
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,and rub that kid all over my face.

101
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
Yeah, or you could wishthat I didn't have them now.

102
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
Can I see your face?

103
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
No. You don't wanna see a facecovered with pox.

104
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
It could be lox, I wouldn't care.

105
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
And you hate fish.

106
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
So sweet. All right.

107
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
Okay, all right.You can see.

108
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
This is me.

109
00:05:58 --> 00:05:59
Sorry!

110
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
I am scary!

111
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
The lightening wasan unfortunate coincidence.

112
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
You look lovely!Lovely!

113
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
I hate this.

114
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
I had the most amazingtwo weeks planned for us.

115
00:06:10 --> 00:06:14
And everything I had in mind,we had to be a lot closer than this.

116
00:06:14 --> 00:06:18
I've spent the last eight monthsin a steel tube with men...

117
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
...thinking about this moment.

118
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
I am not gonna let a bunch...

119
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
...of itchy spots stand between us.

120
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
Okay. This is the mostromantic disease I've ever had.

121
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
- How's the first day?- Good. It's like you said.

122
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
It's putting numbersfrom one column into another.

123
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
There you go.

124
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
And everybody's nice. I just hada good talk with that lady Jeannie.

125
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
Jeannie? The head ofEast Coast operations, Jeannie?

126
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
Turns out our kids goto the same school.

127
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
Yeah. Small world, huh?

128
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
Weird world.

129
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
Your kids?

130
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
I figure my character has kids.

131
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
There isn't a part of that sentenceI don't need explained.

132
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
When you're acting, you needto think about that stuff.

133
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
My character,Joseph the processing guy...

134
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
...has two little girls,Ashley and Brittany.

135
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
Ashley copies everythingBrittany does.

136
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
Well, invisible kidscan be that way sometimes.

137
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,are thinking of having a third kid.

138
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
You know what?

139
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
Just did.

140
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
That's some pretty powerfulimaginary sperm you must have there.

141
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
Know what makes the itching worse?

142
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
That you don't stop talking about it?

143
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
- Fine.- Let's just play, okay?

144
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
Good, okay.

145
00:07:56 --> 00:07:57
Here we go, double sixes.

146
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
Here we go...

147
00:08:00 --> 00:08:01
Here we go...

148
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Come to Mama.Getting ready to roll the dice...

149
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
What are you doing?Are you scratching?

150
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
No. This is what I dofor luck, okay?

151
00:08:09 --> 00:08:10
You're scratching.

152
00:08:11 --> 00:08:11
Give me the dice.

153
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
- Give me the dice.- No! Here. There!

154
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
Look, double sixes!

155
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
We can't scratch. We'll scar.

156
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
I can't stop thinking about it.It's just so hard.

157
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
I wanna grab these housesand rub them all over my body.

158
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
- No!- Give it!

159
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
Come on!

160
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
You know you want it.You know you want it too.

161
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
Let's just be bad.It'll feel so good.

162
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
Come on.

163
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
Oh, God, help me.

164
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
- Oh, yeah.- Okay, good. Now do me.

165
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
Do my back.Oh, come on. Harder!

166
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
There you go.

167
00:08:42 --> 00:08:43
- Don't move.- Why?

168
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
- Don't move.- What are you...?

169
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
Stop that.Stop that right now.

170
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
I might've expected this of Phoebe.But, Ryan, you're a military man.

171
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
You and Milton have to join uson the boat. Bring the kids.

172
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
We'll make a day of it.

173
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
That sounds lovely.We'll have to set it up.

174
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
I better get back.Hope the baby feels better.

175
00:09:06 --> 00:09:07
Thanks.

176
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
- Bye-bye, Jeannie.- Bye-bye, Joseph.

177
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
What a phony.

178
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
You'll teach her a lesson when shesteps off the dock onto nothing.

179
00:09:18 --> 00:09:19
- Hey, Mr. Douglas.- Sir.

180
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
Bing, I got your memo. We're not gonnasee the report until next Friday?

181
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
My group wants to spendthe holiday with family.

182
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
I have a family.I'm gonna be here.

183
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
Yeah, Bing.What's that about?

184
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
It's about cutting thema little slack for morale.

185
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
Look, I can get somerough numbers by Wednesday.

186
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
Rough numbers?

187
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
This company wasn't builton rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

188
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
Have the final numberson my desk by Tuesday.

189
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
If you say so, sir.

190
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
Joseph's good, isn't he?

191
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
I'm going to kill you.

192
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
Hey, I just figured Joseph'sthe kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

193
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
You know, get in there,ruffle some feathers.

194
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
Why?

195
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
Look, I'm sorry,but that's what Joseph does.

196
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
Okay? If you try to pull something...

197
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
...he'll call you on it.

198
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
"What are you trying to pull?"He'll say.

199
00:10:18 --> 00:10:18
Duct tape.

200
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
Was I supposed to bring something too?

201
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
This is for the scratchy twins.I taped oven mitts to their hands.

202
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
You're strict.

203
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
Well, it's for their own good.

204
00:10:28 --> 00:10:32
You know, I like the way you haveefficiently folded this tab under.

205
00:10:32 --> 00:10:37
See, in a tape emergency you couldshave valuable seconds off your time.

206
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
Exactly!

207
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
God, I love that I can betotally neurotic around you now.

208
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
Tell me the truth.

209
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
Don't you like having everythingon your desk perpendicular?

210
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
If it's not a right angle,it is a wrong angle.

211
00:10:50 --> 00:10:50
- Very good.- Thank you.

212
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.

213
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
You're gonna do what to my clocks?

214
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
Set them to my time.

215
00:10:58 --> 00:10:59
I'm confused.

216
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
I thought we shared time.

217
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
No. See, in my bedroomI set my clock six minutes fast.

218
00:11:06 --> 00:11:06
Wanna know why?

219
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
Because it's in a slightly differenttime zone than the kitchen?

220
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
Forget it.

221
00:11:11 --> 00:11:12
No, come on, tell me.

222
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
- You don't understand.- Come on.

223
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
You don't have any obsessive things.

224
00:11:16 --> 00:11:17
No, that's not true.

225
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
Oh, yeah?Tell me one of yours.

226
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
One of my things isI always separate my sweat socks...

227
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
...from my dress socks.

228
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
What if they get mixed up?

229
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
Boy, I would just...

230
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
I would freak out.

231
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
You would not.

232
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
I can't believe this.I hate this. You're too normal.

233
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
I can't believe youdon't have a "thing".

234
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing".

235
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
See, if anyone overheard that,I didn't come off well.

236
00:11:58 --> 00:12:02
- Mr. Douglas is looking for you.- Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

237
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
He suspects you dropped the ballon the Lender project.

238
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
Why? Why does he suspect that?

239
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
At first, he thought it was Joseph...

240
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
...but after he asked Joseph about it,turns out it was you.

241
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
- Anyway, I thought you should know.- All right. That's it.

242
00:12:18 --> 00:12:19
Look, Joey...

243
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
...I realize this is the roleof a lifetime for you...

244
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
...and if I could just fire Joseph,I would. But that's not possible.

245
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
So I have to let you both go.

246
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
What? Everybody loves Joseph.

247
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
I don't. I hate Joseph.

248
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.

249
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
You can't fire Joseph.He's not in your department.

250
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
All right, okay.So I can't fire Joseph...

251
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
...but I can sleep with his wife.

252
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
Not Karen!

253
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
Yeah, I'm thinking abouthaving an affair with her.

254
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
You know what?

255
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
I just did.

256
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
What the hell are you doing?

257
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
Oh, it's not me.

258
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
It's my character!

259
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
Chandie.

260
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
The rogue processor who seduceshis coworkers' wives...

261
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
...and then laughs about it.

262
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
In fact, I have her pantiesright there in my drawer!

263
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
- Really?- No, freak show, she's fictional!

264
00:13:17 --> 00:13:18
Take it easy.

265
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
If it means that much to you,I'll go find something else.

266
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
Thank you.

267
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
It's just thatI'm gonna miss Joseph.

268
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
I liked him. His wife.

269
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
She was hot.

270
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
Please take these off.I swear I won't scratch.

271
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
No, sorry, hon.Monica's orders.

272
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
Well, that wasn't easy.

273
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
Okay, dinner's on.

274
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
There's a peach cobblerwarming in the oven.

275
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
So the plate's gonna be hot, but thatshouldn't be a problem for you.

276
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
All right, you kids.Bye, now.

277
00:13:54 --> 00:13:55
- Bye.- Oh, look, look.

278
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
A low-budget puppet show.

279
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
A shame you can't seewhat finger I'm holding up.

280
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
- Wine?- Please.

281
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
- Spilled some.- I got it.

282
00:14:26 --> 00:14:27
You look beautiful tonight.

283
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
What?

284
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
Sorry.

285
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
You look beautiful.

286
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
You know what? That's it.That's it.

287
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
Oh, yes.

288
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
Good.

289
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
You guys, did you...?

290
00:15:13 --> 00:15:14
Monica...

291
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
...wake up.

292
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
What's up?

293
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
I thought of a thing.

294
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
Yeah?

295
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
I have to sleep, have to,on this side of the bed.

296
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
No. You have to sleepon this side of the bed...

297
00:15:31 --> 00:15:35
...because I have to sleepon this side of the bed.

298
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
Or so I would have you believe.

299
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
So you have a side of the bed.Everybody has a side of the bed.

300
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
Hey, come on. You haven'theard my reason yet.

301
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
All right, go on.

302
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
I have to sleep on the west side...

303
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
...because I grew up in California...

304
00:15:53 --> 00:15:54
...and otherwise...

305
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
...the ocean would be on the wrong side.

306
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
Oh, my God.

307
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
You're a freak!

308
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
How about that?

309
00:16:09 --> 00:16:10
Where're you shipping off to?

310
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
I really can't say.

311
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?

312
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
I can't say.

313
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
Do you get to look througha periscope thingy?

314
00:16:18 --> 00:16:19
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

315
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
Wow, it's neat learningabout submarines.

316
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
- I better not miss my flight.- I'll walk you out.

317
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
- Bye, Ryan.- Pleasure. Take care.

318
00:16:31 --> 00:16:36
So do you think we could get youone of those uniform things?

319
00:16:36 --> 00:16:37
You like that, do you?

320
00:16:37 --> 00:16:38
Oh, yeah.

321
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
I'll make some calls.

322
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
Can you believe that's howwe spent our two weeks?

323
00:16:44 --> 00:16:45
We didn't do the romanticthings I'd planned...

324
00:16:45 --> 00:16:49
...like having a picnic in Central Parkand coffee at Central Perk.

325
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
Oh, I just got that!

326
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
Taxi!

327
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
Bye, you.

328
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
I'm sorry, we're...

329
00:17:20 --> 00:17:21
Hey, sailor.

330
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
Is this what you had in mind?

331
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
I'll say.

332
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

333
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
Well, then...

334
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
...we better make this night count.

335
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
Wait, I forgot to turn offthe cappuccino machine.

336
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
Anchors aweigh.

337
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
Oh, wait, wait!My purse, my purse!

338
00:17:57 --> 00:17:59
I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

339
00:17:59 --> 00:18:02
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

340
00:18:05 --> 00:18:07
Honey!
