I already packed.But I couldn't find your Speedo.

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.

00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
- We know it's Ross.- How? How do you know?

13
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

14
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
I wanted Ross to know first.But I'm relieved!

15
00:00:51 --> 00:00:54
- I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!- I know.

16
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
- Me too!- I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

17
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
- You'll all be aunts and uncles.- But I'm the only one related by blood.

18
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
Now that you all know, you can giveme advice on how to tell Ross.

19
00:01:08 --> 00:01:09
What'll you say?

20
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
That I'm having it. And he can beas involved as he wants.

21
00:01:13 --> 00:01:14
That sounds good.

22
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
Yeah, but how do I start?What's the first thing that I say?

23
00:01:21 --> 00:01:24
- Okay, great. Thanks.- Hey, good luck.

24
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
Yeah, bye.

25
00:01:26 --> 00:01:27
What was that about?

26
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
No harm in telling you now.Rachel and Ross are having a baby.

27
00:01:31 --> 00:01:36
What? I didn't even know!Why didn't you tell me?

28
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
Why am I talking like this?

29
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
I didn't thinkyou could keep it a secret.

30
00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
I'm an excellent secret-keeper.I've kept all our secrets.

31
00:01:45 --> 00:01:47
- What secrets?- No, no, Joey.

32
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
I'm not gonna tell you becauseI am an excellent secret-keeper.

33
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
- You'll tell me later?- You already know.

37
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
It's so romantic to send people offon their honeymoon.

38
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
You know, they're married.Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

39
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42
- Maybe you and I should do something.- All in good time, my love.

40
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
I left my guitar in their apartment.You can let me in, right?

41
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
They took my key to give to you.

42
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
- What? They took mine to give to you.- Why would they take our keys?

43
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
- Maybe they don't trust us.- They let me keep my key last time.

44
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
When you broke the ketchup bottleand cleaned it with Monica's towels?

45
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
- I washed those.- No, you didn't.

46
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

47
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
- I really need my guitar.- I have stuff in there too.

48
00:03:09 --> 00:03:13
- What stuff?- Monica's chicken parm. I'll fix it.

49
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
Mr. Treeger? I need to get intoMonica's apartment. It's an emergency!

50
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
Gas leak.Oh, and bring garlic bread.

51
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
- Did Rachel find you?- No, why?

52
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
- She was looking for you.- I guess I'll catch up with her later.

53
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
- She really wanted to talk to you now.- Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

54
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
- Oh, no.- What?

55
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
I think I might knowwhat this is about.

56
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
Really?

57
00:03:47 --> 00:03:52
Yeah. We promised we weren'tgonna tell anybody this...

58
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
...but a month ago,Rachel and I slept together.

59
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
And?

60
00:04:00 --> 00:04:05
- Wow, I thought you'd be more shocked.- Oh, sorry. And?!

61
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
Well, we said we'd justdo it that one time...

62
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
...but now I think she maywanna start things up again.

63
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

64
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
- Why? What else could it be?- Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

65
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
I'm telling you,that's what it is.

66
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
No wonder she was lookingat me funny at the wedding.

67
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
She didn't say anything to you?

68
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
Maybe it's something you ate.

69
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.- Yeah, I guess I should.

70
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
You know what I have to realize?

71
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
I'm not the type of guywomen can have just one night with.

72
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
They always seem to wanta little bit more.

73
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
I should remember that.

74
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Next.

75
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
- They're kissing, let's go around.- They're in love.

76
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
I'm in love too.But in an orderly fashion.

77
00:05:09 --> 00:05:14
- Next.- Hi. Can you do that and walk?

78
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
Sorry, we didn't hear you.We're on our honeymoon.

79
00:05:18 --> 00:05:23
Let me see what I can do.There are some first class seats.

80
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
They bumped them up to first class!Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.

81
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
We are on our honeymoon.

82
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
- Grab my ass.- Next.

83
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.I'm so in love with my new husband.

84
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
- We're on our honeymoon.- Congratulations.

85
00:05:40 --> 00:05:44
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

86
00:05:44 --> 00:05:48
We're on our honeymoon, so can youbump us up to first class?

87
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
I'm sorry, that couplegot the last two seats.

88
00:05:51 --> 00:05:56
If we'd gone around them like I said,she'd have given us those tickets!

89
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
25J and K, any chancethose aren't together?

90
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
They took my key.You trust me with yours.

91
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
Of course, and I'll give it back...

92
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
...when they're doneat the key shining place.

93
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
What the hell is that?

94
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
- What are you doing?- You said there was a gas leak.

95
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
- Why don't you use your key?- I won't find it before it explodes.

96
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
If that happens at another buildingI manage, people will ask questions.

97
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
We could have done that.

98
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
They're going intothe first class lounge.

99
00:06:35 --> 00:06:36
- You know what's in there?- No.

100
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
Me neither. We have to get in!

101
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
- Just act like you belong.- Oh, my God! Oranges!

102
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
- Nice to see you again.- May I see your tickets, please?

103
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
Yes, of course.

104
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
I can't see the seat number.

105
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
That's all right.I have it memorized. It's 1 A.

106
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
- This isn't first class, sorry.- Apology accepted.

107
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
Sir, I'm afraid I'm goingto have to ask you to leave.

108
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
Fine.

109
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
Go, go, go!

110
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
I think there's something thatwe really need to talk about.

111
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
I think we do.Why don't we go inside?

112
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
- Look, I know why you're here.- You do?

113
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
Yeah, and to save you from anyembarrassment, I should talk first.

114
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
Ross and Rachel.Rachel and Ross.

115
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
It's been one heck of a seesaw,hasn't it?

116
00:08:01 --> 00:08:02
What?

117
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
I mean, look, that one night we hadwas fun and certainly passionate.

118
00:08:08 --> 00:08:12
But don't you think it's betterif we just stay friends?

119
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
Seriously, what?

120
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
Okay, okay. You know what?

121
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
If you want to,we can do it one more time.

122
00:08:23 --> 00:08:28
I'd be okay with that.In fact, I have some time right now.

123
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
- You know what? Can I talk now?- Oh, sure.

124
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
I'm pregnant.

125
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
Ross?

126
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Ross?

127
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
Okay, whenever you're ready.

128
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
And you're the father, by the way.

129
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
- Can I get you some water?- I'm good, I'm good.

130
00:09:12 --> 00:09:17
Ross, there is no pressure on you.You can be as involved as you want.

131
00:09:20 --> 00:09:25
Yeah, I... I'm just, I don't know.I don't understand...

132
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
...how this happened.

133
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
- We used a condom.- I know.

134
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
But you know, condoms only work,like, 97%"%" of the time.

135
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
What? What?

136
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
What?!

137
00:09:42 --> 00:09:46
Well, they should put that on the box!

138
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
- They do.- No, they don't!

139
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
Well, they should put itin huge block letters!

140
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
- Let's just forget about the condoms.- Well, I may as well have!

141
00:10:04 --> 00:10:09
- I was really freaked out too when...- Freaked out? I'm not freaked out.

142
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
I'm indignant as a consumer!

143
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
- You know what? Let's talk later.- No, I wanna talk now.

144
00:10:16 --> 00:10:22
In fact, I wanna talk tothe president of the condom company.

145
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
Okay, maybe I should come back...

146
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
Yeah, I'll press one!

147
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
- I looked everywhere. No gas leak.- So now I can heat this up?

148
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
I'll get moving on that door.

149
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
Great. Could you not tellChandler and Monica about this?

150
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
They don't have any kidsof their own...

151
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
...and this door waslike a child to them.

152
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
I have to put in a new lock.They'll find out anyway.

153
00:10:51 --> 00:10:55
This looks like an all-day job.I'll have to cancel my yoga class.

154
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
Could you tell JasmineI can't make it to yoga?

155
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
- Namaste.

156
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
- What happened to the door?- So it's noticeable?

157
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
- Is Rachel here?- Didn't you two already talk?

158
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
Yeah, but...

159
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
You guys know Rachel and I slepttogether, but there's something else.

160
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
Rachel's pregnant.

161
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
- Holy mother of God!- I can't believe it!

162
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
- With my child.- That is brand-new information!

163
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
- You already know, don't you?- A little bit.

164
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
- How you doing?- Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

165
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
I didn't handle it well.

166
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
- What'd you say?- Nothing.

167
00:11:42 --> 00:11:46
But the complaint departmentat the condom company got an earful.

168
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
Then when I turned around,she was gone.

169
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
But in my defense, I found outthat condoms are only 97%"%" effective.

170
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
- What?- I gotta go find her.

171
00:11:56 --> 00:12:01
Hold on! Are you serious? So, like,3%"%" of the time they don't even work?

172
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
They should put that on the box!

173
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
- Evidently, they do.- What?!

174
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
- I can't believe we're here.- You've gotta be kidding.

175
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
What?

176
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
As a wedding gift, we'regiving you the Honeymoon Suite.

177
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
No! You have been screwing us all day!

178
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
- Who are you?- We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

You can have the suite.We don't care where we stay.

00:12:41 --> 00:12:46
We're here to celebrate our love.We just want to be together.

183
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
We need the stuff.

184
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
Hey, it's Joey. We smell gasfrom your apartment.

185
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
- Are you serious? Joey smells gas.- What else is new?

186
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
- We'd check it, but you took our keys.- Do something. Get in!

187
00:13:04 --> 00:13:08
- How? I could break down your door."- Yeah", "do that."

188
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
- No.

189
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
- Are you doing it? I can't hear.- Okay, I'll break it down.

190
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
He's doing it,he's breaking down the door.

191
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
Okay, we're in.

192
00:13:29 --> 00:13:33
- Rachel, are you comfortable?- Lf I said I was, would you judge me?

193
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
The doctor'll be here in a minuteto do your sonogram.

194
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
Oh, man, I swear, if they soldthese at Pottery Barn...

195
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
We need to talk.

196
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
Right now? I kind of got an alfrescosituation going on over here.

197
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
I want to apologizefor the way I acted earlier.

198
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
- Can you stay up near my head?- Yeah, sorry.

199
00:13:58 --> 00:14:03
I went crazy. I was thinking about me,and I should've thought of you...

200
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
- Head, Ross! Head!- Right.

201
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
I want you to know that I'll bethere through this whole thing.

202
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
Doctor's appointments, Lamaze classes,baby-proofing the apartment.

203
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
- We can do that after we get married.- Married?

204
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
We should get married.

205
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
Because that's your answerto everything?

206
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
No, it's the right thing to do.

207
00:14:24 --> 00:14:29
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.But we are not in love, are we?

208
00:14:29 --> 00:14:33
No, but still, I mean,you can't possibly do this alone.

209
00:14:34 --> 00:14:35
Excuse me?

210
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
Come on, you can't even eat alonein a restaurant.

211
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
- What?- How can you have a baby by yourself?

212
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
- I can too eat by myself!- When have you ever?

213
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
When certain people leave the tableand I am not finished!

214
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
Certain others take two hoursto eat soup!

215
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
Please, you inhale your food.

216
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
I grew up with Monica. If youdidn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

217
00:15:00 --> 00:15:01
Am I interrupting?

218
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
No, Dr. Long, come in.This is Ross, the father.

219
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
But not the husband,because she can do this alone.

220
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
Nice to meet you.I'll get started on this.

221
00:15:13 --> 00:15:17
- Why can't you admit you need me?- I need you to stay near my head!

222
00:15:18 --> 00:15:22
Okay. Everything looks good.Here it is on the screen.

223
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
There's your uterus...

224
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
...and right here is your baby.

225
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
Oh, my God.

226
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
Wow! There it is, I see it.

227
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
Congratulations.I'll give you two a minute.

228
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
Thank you.

229
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
Pretty amazing, huh?

230
00:15:49 --> 00:15:51
I don't see it!

231
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
- What? What?- I can't see it.

232
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
- You just said you did.- I know, I lied.

233
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
I didn't want her to thinkI was a terrible mother.

234
00:16:07 --> 00:16:12
Come here. Sure you can.Come here. Look, it's right there.

235
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
Oh, it's beautiful.

236
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
I see it now.

237
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
- Do you really?- No, I don't see it!

238
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Come on. All right. Okay. Okay.

239
00:16:27 --> 00:16:32
You see this tiny thingthat looks like a peanut?

240
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
Sweetie, that's it.

241
00:16:35 --> 00:16:39
That's it? Well, I saw that.

242
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
- Thank you.- You're welcome.

243
00:16:48 --> 00:16:52
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

244
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
Yeah, that's our baby.

245
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
- So how was the doctor?- It went great.

246
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
- Good.- Show them the picture of your uterus.

247
00:17:15 --> 00:17:16
I don't see the baby.

248
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
I couldn't see it eitherat first. But it's right...

249
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
Ross, I lost it again.
