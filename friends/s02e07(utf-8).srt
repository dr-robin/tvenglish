00:00:01 --> 00:00:01
I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
What is it about me?Do I not look fun enough?

4
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
Is there somethingrepellent about me?

5
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
How was the party?

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
It couldn't have been worse.A woman literally passed through me.

7
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
What is it?Am I hideously unattractive?

8
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
No, you are not.You are very attractive.

9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
I go through the same thing.

10
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
When I put on a little weight,I question everything.

11
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
I've put on weight?

12
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Did you want to...?

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
No, not weight.More like insulation.

14
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
I'm unemployed,in dire need of a project.

15
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
Wanna work out?I can remake you.

16
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
I would, but that might getin the way of my lying-around time.

17
00:00:42 --> 00:00:42
Please?

18
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
Come on, let her do it!

19
00:00:45 --> 00:00:45
All right.

20
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
If we put on spandex and my boobsare bigger than yours, I'm going home.

21
00:00:49 --> 00:00:50
Your boobs are fine.

22
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
I shouldn't have said anything.

23
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
Come here. Come here!

24
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
Can't make hands meet!

27
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
Let's do it!

28
00:01:45 --> 00:01:45
What?

29
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
Nothing. Just never seenyour little stretchy pants before.

30
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
And we're changing.

31
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
Come on, give me five more!

32
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
Five more!

33
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
Five more and I'll flash you.

34
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
One...

35
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
...two...

36
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
...two and a half.

37
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Just show me one of them.

38
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
She's insane!

39
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
The woman is insane.

40
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
It's before work, after work,and during work.

41
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
She's got me doingbutt-clenches at my desk.

42
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
And now they won'tbring me my mail anymore.

43
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
Hey, Pheebs.How'd it go with Scott?

44
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
It was nice. Took himto a romantic restaurant...

45
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
...ordered champagne. Nice.

46
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
He still won't put out?

47
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

48
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
Sorry, Pheebs.

49
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.

50
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
I like him a lot.

51
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
He's really interesting,and he's really sweet.

52
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Why won't he give it up?

53
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
Maybe he drives his caron the other side of the road.

54
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
If you know what I mean.

55
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
No. What do you mean?He's not British.

56
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
Maybe he's gay.

57
00:03:15 --> 00:03:16
I don't think that's the problem.

58
00:03:17 --> 00:03:18
We went dancingthe other night...

59
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
...and just the way he held me so closeand looked into my eyes...

60
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
I just definitely felt something.

61
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
But how much can youtell from a look?

62
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
I felt it on my hip.I could tell.

63
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
Yo, Bing!Racquetball in 20 minutes.

64
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my handand smack her with it.

65
00:03:38 --> 00:03:39
Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

66
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
What?

67
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
I don't care.I have a date tonight.

68
00:03:44 --> 00:03:45
You have a date?

69
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
Monica's setting me up.

70
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
What about Ross and...

71
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
What? My wholeinsane jealousy thing?

72
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
Well, you know,as much fun as that was...

73
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
...I've decided to opt for sanity.

74
00:03:56 --> 00:03:57
You're okay about all this?

75
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
Oh, yeah, come on!I'm moving on.

76
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
He can press her up againstthat window as much as he wants.

77
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
For all I care, he can throw herthrough the damn thing.

78
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
Hi, guys.

79
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow andpick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

80
00:04:12 --> 00:04:13
If you say his full name.

81
00:04:14 --> 00:04:19
Can I come over tomorrow and pick upFluffy Meowington's cat toys?

82
00:04:19 --> 00:04:19
All right.

83
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
- You're getting a cat?- Actually, we're getting a cat.

84
00:04:23 --> 00:04:24
Together?

85
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
Both of you? Together?

86
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
It'll live with Ross half the timeand with me half the time.

87
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
Well, isn't that just lovely?

88
00:04:33 --> 00:04:34
That's something you'll enjoy...

89
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
...for a really, really,really long time.

90
00:04:37 --> 00:04:38
Hopefully.

91
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
Look at that.I gotta go! I got a date!

92
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
With a man.

93
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
You guys have a really good night...

94
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
...and you two have a really good cat.

95
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
We're not supposed totake these when we leave.

96
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
I don't know if Monica told you, butthis my first date since my divorce.

97
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
If I seem a little nervous...

98
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
...I am.

99
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
How long do cats live?

100
00:05:10 --> 00:05:10
I'm sorry?

101
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
Cats. How long do they live?

102
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
Figuring you don't throw themunder a bus or something?

103
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
Maybe 15, 16 years.

104
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
Well, that's just great.

105
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
Cheers!

106
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
Right. Clink.

107
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
Monica told you I was cuterthan this, didn't she?

108
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
No, Michael, it's not you.Sorry. It's just...

109
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
It's this thing.

110
00:05:38 --> 00:05:39
It's not as bad as it sounds...

111
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
...but this friend of mine isgetting a cat with his girlfriend.

112
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
Oh, that does sound...

113
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
He just started going out with her.

114
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
Is this guy an old boyfriend?

115
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
Yeah, he wishes.

116
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
I'm sorry. Look at me.

117
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
Michael, let's talk about you.

118
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
So...

119
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Did you ever get a petwith a girlfriend?

120
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
- So I figured it out.- What?

121
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Why Scott doesn't wantto sleep with me.

122
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
I'm not sexy enough.

123
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
Phoebe, that's crazy.

124
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
When I first met you,you know what I said?

125
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

126
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
Really? That's so sweet.

127
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
I mean, I'm officially offended.But that's so sweet.

128
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
If you wanna know what the deal is,you're gonna have to ask him.

129
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
You're right. You're right.

130
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
You are so "yum"!

131
00:06:56 --> 00:07:01
I mean, it's a cat, you know?It's a cat.

132
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
Why can't they get a bug?One of those fruit flies.

133
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Those things that live for a day.

134
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
What are they called?

135
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
Fruit flies?

136
00:07:10 --> 00:07:11
Thank you.

137
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
Would you like dessert?

138
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
No dessert.

139
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
Just the check. Please.

140
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
Oh, no. You're nothaving fun, are you?

141
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
No, no, I am.

142
00:07:20 --> 00:07:25
But only because I've been playingthe movie "Diner" in my head.

143
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Oh, look at me.

144
00:07:27 --> 00:07:28
Look at me.

145
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
I'm on a datewith a really great guy.

146
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
All I can think about is Ross...

147
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
...and his cat...

148
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
...and his Julie.

149
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
I just want to get over him.Why can't I do that?

150
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
Look, I've been through a divorce.Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

151
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
You can't see it becauseyou haven't had closure...

152
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
Closure!

153
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
That's what it is!That's what I need!

154
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
God, you're brilliant!

155
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
Why didn't I think of that?How do I get that?

156
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
Well, there's no one wayreally, it's just...

157
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
Whatever it takes so thatyou can finally say to him:

158
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
"I'm over you."

159
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
Over you.

160
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
That's what it is.

161
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
Closure.

162
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
Hello? Excuse me?

163
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
Excuse me. Hel...

164
00:08:16 --> 00:08:16
- Hang on.- Excuse me?

165
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
- What?- Hi. I'm sorry.

166
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
I need to borrow your phonefor just one minute.

167
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
- I'm talking.- I see that.

168
00:08:23 --> 00:08:28
One phone call, I'll be very quick.I'll even pay for it myself.

169
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
You're being a little weirdabout your phone.

170
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
All right. Fine.

171
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
I'll call you back.

172
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
Thank you.

173
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
Machine.

174
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
- Just waiting for the beep.- Good.

175
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

176
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
I'm just calling to say that...

177
00:08:55 --> 00:08:56
...everything's fine.

178
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
And I'm really happy for you...

179
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
...and your cat.

180
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
Who, by the way, I thinkyou should name Michael.

181
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
You see there,I'm thinking of names...

182
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
...so obviously I am over you.

183
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
I am over you.

184
00:09:14 --> 00:09:19
And that, my friend,is what they call "closure".

185
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
It's Sunday morning.I'm not running on a Sunday.

186
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
- Why not?- Because it's Sunday!

187
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
It's God's day.

188
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
If you say stop, then we stop.

189
00:09:41 --> 00:09:41
Stop.

190
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
No, come on! We can't stop!

191
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
We got three more pounds to go!

192
00:09:45 --> 00:09:49
I am the energy trainand you are on board!

193
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
And how was the date?

194
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
I think there was a restaurant.

195
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
I know there was wine.

196
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.

197
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
I just need the cat toys.Did Monica say...

198
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
What? Why are youlooking at me like that?

199
00:10:19 --> 00:10:20
I'm sorry. I don't know, I...

200
00:10:21 --> 00:10:22
I feel like I dreamedabout you last night...

201
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
...but I don't remember.

202
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
There they are.

203
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
Did we speak on the phone?Did you call me?

204
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

205
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
I haven't even been home yet.Do you mind if I check my messages?

206
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

207
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
Rach, I got a message from you!

208
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
Who's Michael?

209
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
Oh, my God!

210
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
Ross, no! Hang up the phone.Give me the phone!

211
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
Give me the...

212
00:11:01 --> 00:11:02
You're over me?

213
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
Oh, God!

214
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
- You're...- Oh, God.

215
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
You're over me?

216
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
When were you...

217
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
...under me?

218
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
Rachel, do you...?

219
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
I mean, were you?

220
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
What?

221
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
Basically...

222
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
...lately, I've...

223
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
I've sort of had feelings for you.

224
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
You've had feelings for me?

225
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
So? You had feelings for me first!

226
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
You know about my...You know I had...

227
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
You know?

228
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
Chandler told me.

229
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
When did he? When did he?When did he?

230
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
When you were in China.

231
00:11:56 --> 00:11:57
Meeting Julie.

232
00:11:57 --> 00:12:01
Julie. That's...Oh, God!

233
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
I need to lie down.

234
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
No, I'm gonna stand.

235
00:12:05 --> 00:12:06
I'm gonna stand...

236
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
...and I'm gonna walk.I'm walking and I am standing.

237
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
Now you're over me?

238
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
Are you over me?

239
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
That's Julie.

240
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
- I've got a cab waiting.

241
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
I'll be right down!

242
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
Wait, so you're going?

243
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
Well, okay, I have to.I can't deal with this right now.

244
00:12:40 --> 00:12:41
I mean, I've...You know, I've got a cab.

245
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
I've got a girlfriend.I'm gonna go get a cat.

246
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
Cat!

247
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
- Hey, Joey.- Hey, Pheebs.

248
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
How come you're watchinga rabbi play electric guitar?

249
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
I can't find the remote.

250
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
Thank you.

251
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
Scott asked me to come overfor lunch and I did.

252
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
- And?- And we did.

253
00:13:20 --> 00:13:21
All right! Way to go!

254
00:13:22 --> 00:13:23
Yea, me!

255
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
So how did it happen?

256
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
I took your advice andasked him what was going on.

257
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
What did he say?

258
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
He understands how sex can bea very emotional thing for a woman.

259
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
And he was just afraidthat I was going to get all:

260
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
"Is he gonna call me the next day?"and "Where is this going?"

261
00:13:39 --> 00:13:44
So he said he wanted to hold offuntil he was prepared to be serious.

262
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please."

263
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
Sex can be just about two peopleright there in the moment.

264
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
If he wants to see me again, he cancall. If not, that's fine too.

265
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
So after a lot of talking...

266
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
...I convinced him.

267
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
Let me get this straight.

268
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

269
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
He got you to sayhe never has to call you again.

270
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
And he got you thinkingthis is a great idea?

271
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
This man is my god!

272
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
I didn't get a cat.

273
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
That's interesting.

274
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
No, it's not "interesting".It's very, very not interesting.

275
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
It's actually 100%the opposite of interesting.

276
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
I got it, Ross.

277
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
You had no right to sayyou had feelings for me.

278
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
I was doing great with Juliebefore I knew!

279
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
I was doing greatbefore I knew about you!

280
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
You think it's easyto see you with Julie?

281
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
You should've said something before!

282
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
I didn't know then.And how come you never said anything?

283
00:15:00 --> 00:15:01
There was never a good time.

284
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
You only had a year.And we only hung out every night!

285
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
Not...

286
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
...every night.

287
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
It's not like I didn't try.But things got in the way.

288
00:15:11 --> 00:15:12
You know, like Italian guys...

289
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
...or ex-fiancés...

290
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
...or Italian guys.

291
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
There was one Italian guy, okay?And do you have a point?

292
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
The point is, I don't needthis right now!

293
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
Okay? It's too late.

294
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
I'm with somebody else. I'm happy.This ship has sailed!

295
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
You're just gonna put awayyour feelings for me?

296
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
I've done it since ninth grade.I'm good at it.

297
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
All right, fine.You go ahead and do that.

298
00:15:35 --> 00:15:36
I don't need your ship!

299
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
- Good.- Good!

300
00:15:38 --> 00:15:42
And you know what?Now I got closure!

301
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
Try the bottom one.

302
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

303
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
We're not working out.It's over.

304
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
No way! With one pound to go?Come on!

305
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
We're in the zone, we're groovin'

306
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
I don't mind the last pound.

307
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

308
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
So don't make me do anythingthat I'll regret.

309
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
What you gonna do, fat boy?

310
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
What?

311
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
Nothing. Except tell you it'swonderful how much energy you have.

312
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
Well, thanks.

313
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
Especially considering how toughit's been for you to find work.

314
00:17:22 --> 00:17:27
You can't tell your parents you werefired, because they'd be disappointed.

315
00:17:29 --> 00:17:33
It's not as if you havea boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

316
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
Well, no. But I...

317
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
If it were me, I'd have difficultygetting out of bed at all.

318
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
You know, I try to stay positive.

319
00:17:46 --> 00:17:47
So you...

320
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
You feel like going for a run?

321
00:17:51 --> 00:17:52
All right.

322
00:17:53 --> 00:17:58
Because you don't have to.You could just take a nap right here.

323
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
For a little while.
