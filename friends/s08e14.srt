00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
- What's up?- I left my guitar here.

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
Okay. No problem.

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
Okay. Here you go.

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
- What?- You want to hang out or something?

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
You caught me at a bad time.

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
- Are you and Chandler...?- Exactly.

7
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
- Can I play for you?- No.

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:31
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?

9
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
You ask an intriguing question,Chandler Bing.

10
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?You never let me massage you.

11
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
- Phoebe, I can explain.- You said you hate massages.

12
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.Don't let Phoebe in.

13
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
How long has this been going on?

14
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
- Well, Alexandra has...- It has a name?

15
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
Phoebe, don't get upset.

16
00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.Come on, Chandler, let's go.

17
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
Well, I thought I'd...

18
00:01:07 --> 00:01:08
Yeah, what the hell.

00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
One more push.Come on, we're almost there.

23
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
I'm happy things worked out for us andwe're having this baby. I love you.

24
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
I love you too.

25
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
I hope it's notan inappropriate time to say...

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
...you're the best sex I've ever had.

27
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
That's always appropriate.

28
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
Okay, come on, one more push.One more push.

29
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05

30
00:02:05 --> 00:02:10
Here is your beautiful baby.Congratulations.

31
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
I hope you're a better fatherthan you are a friend!

32
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
Joey!

33
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
- What's going on?- Come feel my belly.

34
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
- The baby's kicking for the first time.- Really?

35
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
Yes.

36
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
You know what? Maybe you...

37
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
Maybe you should come to me.I'm not wearing any bottoms.

38
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
It's unbelievable!

40
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
Wow, she is kicking so much.She's like...

41
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
Who's that annoyinggirl soccer player?

42
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
- Mia Hamm?- Mia Hamm!

43
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
- It's amazing.- One hand on the sheet, Joe.

44
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
Sorry.

45
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
Hey, babe.

46
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
We got a wedding gift from Bob andFaye Bing. They don't like us, do they?

47
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
Who says you can't geta nice punch bowl for under $6?

48
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
- Maybe we can take it back.- Where would we return it?

49
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
How about to the street,from the balcony?

50
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
Why don't we just find a place for it?

51
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
In that cabinet?

52
00:03:22 --> 00:03:27
That's for canned goods. Have youforgotten everything from orientation?

53
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
How about the closet by the bathroom?

54
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
- Okay. Let me do it.- No, I'll do it.

55
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
You have to relax and let metake care of things once in a while.

56
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
It's locked. You have to help me.Why is it locked?

57
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
No reason.I keep private things in there.

58
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
I've been here a while,and I've never seen what's in there.

59
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
What is in there?

60
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
Feminine stuff.

61
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
Don't try to make me uncomfortablewith feminine stuff!

62
00:03:54 --> 00:03:59
Nothing in there concerns you.If you love me, you'll just let it go.

63
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
- Fine.- Thank you.

64
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
Love you.

65
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
Hello, Chandler.Lovely day, huh? You.

66
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
If it helps, Alexandra's onlybeen massaging her for three years.

67
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
Lf! I said, if it helps.

68
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
Why won't you let me massage you?

69
00:04:27 --> 00:04:31
I'd be self-conscious.You're my friend. I'd be naked.

70
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
We lived together for years.I've seen you naked.

71
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
That's different. We were roommates.And when?

72
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
I'm curious about the human body.

73
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
You can understandwhy this would be weird.

74
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
I'm a professionaland I'm really good.

75
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.Give me a chance. Please?

76
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
If it means that much to you.

77
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
It does. How would you feelif you couldn't share your cooking?

78
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
Or how Ross would feelif he couldn't teach us about dragons.

79
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
- Dinosaurs.- Potato, potahtoe.

80
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
Ross, the baby's kicking.

81
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
What? It is?

82
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
It's not kicking now.

83
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
Although we would loveto see you do that again.

84
00:05:20 --> 00:05:21
When? What happened?

85
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
Last night. I went into Joey's room,and he was sleeping.

86
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
A dreamless sleep.

87
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
My God, the baby's kicking.That's great.

88
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
I wish I would have been there to feelthe kicking for the first time.

89
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
I got some stuff going onif you want to feel.

90
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
I don't want to miss any more babystuff. Here's my pager number.

91
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
Anytime anything pregnancy-relatedhappens, use it.

92
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
I don't care if it's 3 a.m.And you want ice cream.

93
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
Can I get a copy of that?

94
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
- Are you under the sheet?- Yes.

95
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
Great, let's begin.

96
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
How's the pressure?

97
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.

98
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
Stating the obvious, but thank you.

99
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
- And it's not weird, is it?- No.

100
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
That's right, you just enjoy.

101
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
Oh, yeah!

102
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
- Oh, yeah!- Okay.

103
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Oh, God, Phoebe!

104
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
That's it! That's it, right there!

105
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
I wasn't trying to openyour closet, I swear.

106
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,doesn't she? What are you doing?

107
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
Monica has a secret closet.She won't let me see it.

108
00:06:59 --> 00:07:03
- Why not?- I don't know! What's she hiding?

109
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
I don't know.

110
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
I'll bet it's Richard.

111
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
Why would she keep Richard in here?

112
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
Off the top of my head...

113
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
...maybe she's having her cakeand eating it too.

114
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
You being the "cake,"Richard being the "too."

115
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
- Or...- And here we go.

116
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
I saw a movie where there was a door.Nobody knew what was behind it.

117
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
When they finally got it open,millions of bugs came pouring out...

118
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
...and they feasted on human flesh!

119
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
It wouldn't kill youto respect your wife's privacy!

120
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
Stupid closet full of bugs!

121
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
Joey, something feels weirdand not good weird. I don't...

122
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
When my sisters were pregnant...

123
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
...they got weird feelingsand it was always nothing.

124
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
- Really?- Absolutely.

125
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
But we'll stop by the hospitaljust to be sure. I'll page Ross.

126
00:07:57 --> 00:08:02
Rach, look at me. Everything's fine.Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.

127
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
Crushing bones!

128
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
Good thing we're going to a hospital.

129
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
- So?- She's fine.

130
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
She had Braxton Hicks contractions.Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.

131
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
Mild discomfort? I take it you've hadone of these Braxton thingies?

132
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24
- Everything's normal?- Yes.

133
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
- There's no danger?- No.

134
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
Contractions can be unnerving,but she's fine.

135
00:08:29 --> 00:08:33
Thank you, doctor.And thank you for being nice and calm.

136
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
I wasn't calm! I've never beenmore scared in my life.

137
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
- You said everything was okay.- What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

138
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
- But everything is okay. I'm fine.- You sure?

139
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
Yes. I got half a mindto contract that doctor's uterus.

140
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
Mild discomfort!What's he talking about?

141
00:08:50 --> 00:08:51
- Is everything okay?- Yes.

142
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
Your page said, "Come tothe hospital. " What happened?

143
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
Something calledBraxton Hicks contraction.

144
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
That's no big deal.Most women don't feel them.

145
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
No uterus, no opinion.

146
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
What's with the candy?

147
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
I was at the concession standat the movies.

148
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
- You went to the movies by yourself?- Mona!

149
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
- I gotta go back in there.- What's wrong?

150
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
- I just gotta...- No, really, tell me. What's up?

151
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
Look, I forgot my underwear.

152
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
Thanks for bringing herto the hospital.

153
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
Don't worry about it. No big deal.

154
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
But still, it should have been me.I'm the dad.

155
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
- Here's information on Braxton Hicks.- Thanks.

156
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
You did the right thingby bringing her in.

157
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
You'll make a wonderful father.

158
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
Hey, not as good as this guy.He brought Twizzlers.

159
00:09:48 --> 00:09:52
- There has got to be a way.- Easy there, Captain Kirk.

160
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
- Do you have a bobby pin?- Yeah.

161
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
Oh, no, wait.I'm not a 9-year-old girl.

162
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
Then why do you throw like one?

163
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
- Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.- Oh, sure, "Monica."

164
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
So how's the inappropriatecrush on Rachel coming?

165
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
Really good. I should be readyto kill myself any day now.

166
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
Well, you sure found that quick.

167
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
I wish I didn't feel this way aboutRachel. I wish things could be normal.

168
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
I love living with her, andhelping out with the baby is amazing.

169
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
But now I think Ross feels left out.

170
00:10:29 --> 00:10:33
When I took Rachel to the hospital,the doctor thought I was the father.

171
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
You should have seenthe look on Ross' face.

172
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
I have no idea what I'm doing.For all I know, I'm locking it more.

173
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
- You try opening it with a credit card?- That's a good idea.

174
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?

175
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
- I feel terrible.- It's not your fault.

176
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
What are you gonna do, not take her?You're doing nothing wrong.

177
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
Except for harboring lovefor the woman carrying his baby.

178
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
Richard, if you're in there,could you pass me my credit card?

179
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
I gotta tell you, yesterday wasamazing. That massage felt so good.

180
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
No, I got that.

181
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
- Can we make it a weekly appointment?- Okay.

182
00:11:16 --> 00:11:20
You should know though,I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.

183
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
- Okay.- I mean 500.

184
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
- What?- 600.

185
00:11:25 --> 00:11:26
What's going on?

186
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
You make sex noiseswhen you get massaged.

187
00:11:29 --> 00:11:33
It freaked me out. After a while,I tried to hurt you. It spurred you on.

188
00:11:33 --> 00:11:37
You're crazy. There's nothing sexualabout the noises I make.

189
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
There's nothing sexual about this?

190
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
Oh, God!

191
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
What are you looking at?

192
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
I mean, hi.

193
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
This is embarrassing.I'm never getting a massage again.

194
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
Don't let this stop youfrom getting massages.

195
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
I have lots of clientsthat make those noises.

196
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
- Really?- Well, not clients. Lovers.

197
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
We'll try it again. Come back,and we'll work through it.

198
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
- You sure?- Yes.

199
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
- I guess.- Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.

200
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
So did you hear something you liked?

201
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
Hey, Ross, check it out!I learned a new trick.

202
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
Hey, I bought you some lunch.

203
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.

204
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
- Did you put pickles on this?- Well, yeah.

205
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
What? What? Rach, what?

206
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
- What's going on?- I made her tuna with pickle.

207
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.

208
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
Giving her pickle islike giving me salad.

209
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
I'm sorry, I didn't know. You okay?

210
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
I'm fine, but someone make sureit's gone when I get out?

211
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
I'm on it!

212
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
I shouldn't be the onemaking her throw up.

213
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
- It could happen to anyone.- Not to you. You know this stuff.

214
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
I don't know any of itand I'm the father.

215
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
I wish I could bemore involved, you know?

216
00:13:08 --> 00:13:13
Well, if anyone is keeping score,I no longer eat tuna.

217
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

218
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
- Yeah.- What's up?

219
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
Sit down.I wanna talk about our situation.

220
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
Are you breaking up with us?

221
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
The thing is...

222
00:13:29 --> 00:13:33
...because I live with Rachel,I'm here for a lot of stuff.

223
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
And Ross is missing everything. So...

224
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
Yeah?

225
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
You two should live together.

226
00:13:42 --> 00:13:44
Are you asking me to move?You don't want me here?

227
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
No, I love living with you.It just seems that...

228
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
...if you're gonna have a roommate,it may as well be the father.

229
00:13:52 --> 00:13:57
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants meto move in and disrupt his life.

230
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
Or he does.

231
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
I would love to be aroundfor you and the baby.

232
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
We can just try it,like on a temporary basis.

233
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
- But it's you and me.- It wouldn't be anything romantic.

234
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!

235
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
I was supposed to meet heran hour ago. What is wrong with me?

236
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
So, what do you think?

237
00:14:20 --> 00:14:23
- I don't know. Is it crazy?- No.

238
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
Joey, this is a smart idea.

239
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
Well, I was due.

240
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
- Let's do it.- Really?

241
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
Rach, that's great. That's great.

242
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
Not too shabby.I got this all off myself...

243
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
...using my wife's tools.

244
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
Oh, my God.

245
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
How did you get in there?

246
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
You're messy.

247
00:15:01 --> 00:15:06
- No! You weren't supposed to see this!- I married Fred Sanford.

248
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
Chandler, you don't understand.

249
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know.I'm sick.

250
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
No, honey, you're not sick. I don'tlove you because you're organized.

251
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
I love you in spite of that.

252
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
Really?

253
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
- Promise you won't tell anyone?- Yes.

254
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
Now that I know, if I've got extrastuff, can we share the closet?

255
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
Well... It's just...

256
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
I'm afraid you might mess it up.

257
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
So Rachel's all moved out?How you taking it?

258
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
I wanted to have a few beers...

259
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
...but I got rid of those becauseRachel couldn't stand the smell.

260
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
I have thrown back a lotof orange juice with calcium.

261
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
It's a couple weeks past its expirationdate, so it's got a bit of a kick.

262
00:16:02 --> 00:16:06
- Are you okay?- You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.

263
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
I'm better than great. I am good.

264
00:16:10 --> 00:16:15
Now that she's gone, I can do stuffaround here that I couldn't do before.

265
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
Like...

266
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
I can walk around naked again.

267
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
I can...

268
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
I can watch porn in the living room.

269
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
This is good for me.

270
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
I like being on my own.I'm better off this way.

271
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
I'm a lone wolf.

272
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
A loner. Alone.

273
00:16:36 --> 00:16:40
All alone. Forever.

274
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
What's a wolf gotta doto get a hug around here?

275
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
That's it, just relax.

276
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
- Come on, more.- Oh, God!

277
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
You like that, don't you?

278
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
- Yeah, right there.- Want it there? Take it there, baby.

279
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
- Phoebe?- Yeah, say my name. Say it.

280
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
And now I'm goingto cover you back up.

281
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22
And I won't be speaking with youfor several weeks.

282
00:17:27 --> 00:17:28
