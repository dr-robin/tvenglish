1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:04
Friends, family,we're gathered to celebrate...

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
Now Ross, repeat after me.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:11
"I, Ross."

5
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
I, Ross.

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
"Take thee, Emily."

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Take thee, Rachel.

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
Shall I go on?

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
He said "Rachel", right?

10
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
Do you think I should go up there?

11
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
Yes. Yes. Do go on.

12
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
I think we'd better start again.

13
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
Repeat after me.

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:36
"I, Ross."

15
00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
I, Ross.

16
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
"Take thee, Emily."

17
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
Take thee, Emily.

18
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
Like there'd be anybody else.

19
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
"As my lawfully wedded wife,in sickness and in health...

20
00:00:51 --> 00:00:52
...till death parts us."

21
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
As my lawfully wedded wife,in sickness and in health...

22
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
...until death parts us.

23
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
Really, I do. Emily.

24
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
Do you have the rings?

25
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
Place this ring on Ross' finger...

26
00:01:06 --> 00:01:10
...as a symbol ofyour bond everlasting.

27
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
Ross, place this ring...

28
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...

29
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
...of the love thatencircles you forever.

30
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
Happy to.

31
00:01:22 --> 00:01:24
They have madetheir declarations...

32
00:01:24 --> 00:01:29
...and it gives me great pleasureto declare them husband and wife.

33
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
You may kiss the bride.

34
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
This is worse than whenhe married the lesbian.

35
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
Just keep smiling.

36
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
Well, that went well.

37
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
It could've been worse.He could've shot her.

38
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
That was pretty funny, wasn't it?

39
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
The One AfterRoss Says "Rachel"

40
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
You spoiled everything!It's a nightmare!

41
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
My friends and family are out there!How can I face them?

42
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
No matter what happens with them...

43
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
...we still get cake, right?

44
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
That's all right. You take your time.I'll be right out here.

45
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
She's just fixing her makeup.

46
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
I hate you!

47
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
And I love you!

48
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
A bad timeto say the wrong name, huh?

49
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
That's true. Thanks, Dad.

50
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
People should be dancing.

51
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
This is a party! Come on!

52
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
Joey! Dance!

53
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
Yes, Waltham Interiors.

54
00:03:23 --> 00:03:28
This is Ross Geller'spersonal physician, Dr. Filangie.

55
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
Who?

56
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
I discovered that Ross forgotto take his brain medicine.

57
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
Without it, in the brain of Ross...

58
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
...women's names are interchangeable.

59
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
Through no fault of his own.

60
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
Oh, my God! Phoebe.

61
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Filangie.

62
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
Oh, no! You have it too!

63
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
I hope you don't take thisthe wrong way...

64
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
...but I know we had plansto meet up tonight.

65
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
I'm worried about what itmight do to our friendship.

66
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
I know.

67
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
- How could we have let this happen?- Seven times!

68
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
You know, look.We were away.

69
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
In a foreign, romantic country.

70
00:04:16 --> 00:04:17
I blame London.

71
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Bad London!

72
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
So, look...

73
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
...while we're still in London,we can keep doing it, right?

74
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
Well, I don't see thatwe have a choice.

75
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
But when we're back home,we don't do it.

76
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
Only here.

77
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
You know, I sawa wine cellar downstairs.

78
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
I'll meet you there in two minutes.

79
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
Mon? I got to ask you something.

80
00:04:39 --> 00:04:40
Now?

81
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
Ross said my name.I can't just pretend it didn't happen.

82
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
I don't know.

83
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
Monica, what should I do?

84
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
Just do the right thing.

85
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
Tow the line! Thread the needle!Think outside the box!

86
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
I'll talk to Rossabout what he thinks it meant.

87
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
Wait! Rachel, no.

88
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
He's married.

89
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
Married.

90
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
If you don't realize that,I can't help you.

91
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
Okay. You're right.

92
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
You're right.You can't help me.

93
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
Jack, is it all our fault?Were we bad parents?

94
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
Who serves steakwhen there's no place to sit?

95
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
How are you supposed to eat this?

96
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
Hey, what's up?

97
00:05:20 --> 00:05:21
We were supposed to meet.

98
00:05:22 --> 00:05:23
- Forget it. That's off.- Why?

99
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
The next tour of the wine cellar...

100
00:05:26 --> 00:05:31
...will commence in two minutes.

101
00:05:31 --> 00:05:32
Joey, what are you doing?

102
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
You promised, no meattill Phoebe has the babies.

103
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
We're in another country,so it doesn't count.

104
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
- True.- He's got a point.

105
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
I'm sorry things aren't working out.

106
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
It could be better.It'll be okay, right?

107
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
Oh, yeah! Of course.She'll get over this.

108
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
So you said my name.

109
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
You just said itbecause you saw me there.

110
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
If you'd seen a circus freak,you would've said:

111
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
"I take thee, Circus Freak."

112
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
It didn't mean anything.It's a mistake.

113
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
It didn't mean anything.Right?

114
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
Oh, no! Of courseit didn't "mean" anything.

115
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
I can understand why Emilythought it meant something...

116
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
...because it was you.

117
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
But it absolutely didn't.It didn't! It didn't!

118
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
The band's readyfor your first dance with Emily.

119
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
Oh! The band's ready!

120
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
We got to do what the band says.I don't care about the stupid band!

121
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
You spit on me, man!

122
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
Emily is taking kind of a long time.

124
00:06:33 --> 00:06:34
When I locked myself upat my wedding...

125
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
...I was trying to popthe window out of the frame.

126
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
Get the hell out of there.You know?

127
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
I'm coming in!

128
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
Oh, look at that.Same thing.

129
00:06:55 --> 00:07:00
In the middle of everything,if I scream "Yippee!", just ignore me.

130
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
- Oh, my God! Rachel!- Oh, hello, Rachel.

131
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
Ross said my name.

132
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
Okay? My name!

133
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
Ross said my name up there.

134
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
That obviously meanshe still loves me!

135
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
Don't believe me.I know I'm right.

136
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
Do you guys want to goand get a drink?

137
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
Yes, we do.

138
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
But we have to change first.

139
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Yes, I want to change.

140
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
- Go get a table.- We'll only be five minutes.

141
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
Fifteen minutes.

142
00:07:30 --> 00:07:31
Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!

143
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
- Oh, hey, hey.- Oh, great.

144
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
So what happened?

145
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
Well, Ross said my name.

146
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
But I don't thinkthat means anything.

147
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Let's look at this objectively.

148
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
Ninth grade, right?

149
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
The obsession starts.

150
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
Then he sees me ina two-piece for the first time.

151
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
His obsession begins to grow, right?

152
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
Why don't we go change in my room?

153
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
My clothes are...

154
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
Wow, you look...

155
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
No time for that.

156
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
Hey, dude! Let me in!I got a girl out here!

157
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
I got a girl in here!

158
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
No, you don't.I saw you go in with Monica.

159
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
Well, we're hanging out.

160
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
Which one of us will behaving sex in there? Me or you?

161
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
I suppose I wouldhave to say you.

162
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
- What if we're watching a movie?- Which we are!

163
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
And we've paid for it.

164
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
It's "My Giant."

165
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
"My Giant"?

166
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
I love that movie!

167
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
Think this is okay?

168
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Well, Ross and Emilyaren't going to use it.

169
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
Oh, it's so beautiful!

170
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
I don't feel right about this.

171
00:08:55 --> 00:08:56
This is the honeymoon suite.

172
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
The room expects sex.

173
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
The room would be disappointedif it didn't get sex.

174
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
All the other honeymoon suiteswould think it was a loser.

175
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
Nope! Not under here!

176
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
- You didn't find her?- I've looked everywhere.

177
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
You couldn't have,or you would've found her.

178
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
Keep looking!

179
00:09:20 --> 00:09:21
Yeah! For about 30 minutes?

180
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
Or forty-five?

181
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
In 45 minutes,you could find her twice.

182
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
For all I know, she's trying to find mebut couldn't because I kept moving.

183
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
From now on,I'm staying in one place.

184
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
Right here.

185
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
- It's getting late.- We're going to go.

186
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
Do you guys mind staying herefor a while?

187
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
We got to get up earlyand catch that plane.

188
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

189
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
That's cool.

190
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
But we'll stay here with you.

191
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
Thanks, guys!

192
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
I really appreciate this,but you don't need to rub my butt.

193
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
We have to leave in an hour.

194
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
I know. I've been lookingat those doors.

195
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
They look pretty soundproof,don't you think?

196
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
We can't do that.That's insane.

197
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
I mean, A, he could wake up.And B, you know...

198
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
...let's go for it.

199
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
Nope.

200
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
- She's not with us.- We've come for her things.

201
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
Where is she?

202
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
She's in hiding. She's humiliated.She doesn't want to see you again.

203
00:10:46 --> 00:10:51
We're very sad that it didn't work outbetween you and Emily, monkey.

204
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
But I think you'reabsolutely delicious!

205
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
Excuse me,I'm standing right here.

206
00:10:59 --> 00:11:00
Oh, yes.

207
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
There you are.

208
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
Hurry up! Get some!There's a whole cart outside.

209
00:11:06 --> 00:11:07
Goodbye, Geller.

210
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
Now, hold on. Hold on.

211
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
Your daughter and I are supposedto leave tonight for our honeymoon.

212
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
Tell her I'll be at that airport,and I hope she will too.

213
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
I said Rachel's name,but it didn't mean anything.

214
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
She's just a friend.

215
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
Tell Emily I love her and...

216
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
...I can't imagine spending my lifewith anyone else.

217
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
Please, promise me thatyou'll tell her that.

218
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
All right, I'll tell her.

219
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
Come on, bugger face!

220
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
Call me.

221
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
You spend your life in the bathroom.Why do you never go out the window?

222
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
Maybe it's best we nevergot to do it again.

223
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
Yeah, it kind of makesthat one night special.

224
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
Technically, we still areover international waters.

225
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
I'm going to the bathroom.Maybe I'll see you there?

226
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
Can I ask you something?

227
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
Felicity and I watched"My Giant". And I thought...

228
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
...I'll never be as good an actoras that giant.

229
00:12:24 --> 00:12:28
Do you think I'm wasting my lifewith this acting thing?

230
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
The giant's five yearsyounger than me.

231
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
You think I'll ever get there?

232
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
- Thanks, man.- Okay, man.

233
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
But what about how muchtaller he is than me?

234
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
I mean, there's no wayI can make myself taller now.

235
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
Who knows what science willcome up with in the future...

236
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
...but what if I die an unsuccessful,regular-size man?

237
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
You've been in thebathroom for a half-hour.

238
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
I know!

239
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
Had the beef tips, huh?

240
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
You ate meat!

241
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
You had sex!

242
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
No, we didn't.

243
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
I know you didn't.I was talking about Monica.

244
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
I did not have sex.

245
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
This pregnancy isthrowing me all off.

246
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
- I'll say "hi" to the chick and duck.- Me too!

247
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
Why would you need to?You've been feeding them.

248
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
Oh, right.Maybe I'll just go home.

249
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
We certainly are alone.

250
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
Good thing we have that"not New York" rule.

251
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
Listen, since we're on that subject...

252
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
...I just wanted to tell you that...

253
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
I was going througha hard time in London...

254
00:13:56 --> 00:14:01
...with my brother getting married andthat guy thinking I was Ross' mother.

255
00:14:01 --> 00:14:02
Well, anyway, I just...

256
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
That night meant a lot to me.And I'm trying to say thanks.

257
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
You know, that nightmeant a lot to me too.

258
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
It wasn't because I wasin a bad place or anything.

259
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
It just meant a lot becauseyou're really hot.

260
00:14:20 --> 00:14:21
Is that okay?

261
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
That's okay.

262
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
And I'm cute too?

263
00:14:26 --> 00:14:27
And you're cute too!

264
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
Thank you.

265
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
All right, I got to go unpack.

266
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
I'm still on London time.Does that count?

267
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
- Oh, that counts!- Oh, good!

268
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
What are you doing here?

269
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
I've been on standby fora flight home for hours.

270
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
So no sign of Emily?

271
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
Not yet.

272
00:15:11 --> 00:15:12
When do you have to leave?

273
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
for flight 1066 to Athens.

274
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
The last call.

275
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
Pretty soon, I guess.

276
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:23 --> 00:15:24
I don't understand.

278
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
How could she do this?

279
00:15:26 --> 00:15:31
Am I a complete idiot forthinking she'd actually show up?

280
00:15:31 --> 00:15:35
You're not an idiot, Ross.You're a guy very much in love.

281
00:15:35 --> 00:15:36
Same difference.

282
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
to Athens should now be on board.

283
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
I get it!

284
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
Well, that's that.

285
00:15:47 --> 00:15:48
No, you know what?

286
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
I think you should go.

287
00:15:51 --> 00:15:52
I think you should go...

288
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
...by yourself.Get some distance.

289
00:15:54 --> 00:15:57
Clear your head.It would be really good.

290
00:15:57 --> 00:15:58
I don't know.

291
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
Come on.It would be really good for you.

292
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
I could do that.

293
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
I can't even believe her.

294
00:16:08 --> 00:16:09
You know what?I am going to go.

295
00:16:09 --> 00:16:10
- Good.- Why not?

296
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
- Right?- Right.

297
00:16:12 --> 00:16:12
Thanks.

298
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
I'll see you back at home.

299
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
If I ever get a flight out of here.

300
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
What? Wait, what?

301
00:16:21 --> 00:16:22
Why don't you come?

302
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
I mean, I have two tickets.Why not?

303
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
Well, I don't know, Ross.Really?

304
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
Yeah. It'd be great.I mean, you can...

305
00:16:32 --> 00:16:33
You can lay on the beach...

306
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
...and I can cry overmy failed marriage.

307
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
You see how I make jokes?

308
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
Really. I mean...

309
00:16:41 --> 00:16:42
I could use a friend.

310
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
Oh, wow. Maybe.

311
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
Yes, I can do that!

312
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
- Cool.- All right, cool.

313
00:16:52 --> 00:16:53
Okay, we're going to Greece.

314
00:16:54 --> 00:16:55
I forgot my jacket!

315
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
Well, you tell them to wait.

316
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
Wait! Wait!

317
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
I'll have a glass of Merlot...

318
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
...and he'll havea wine spritzer.

319
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
Look!The airport's moving.

320
00:17:28 --> 00:17:29
Are we moving?

321
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
Are we?Why are we moving?

322
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
Does the captain knowthat we're moving?

323
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
Oh, my gosh!
