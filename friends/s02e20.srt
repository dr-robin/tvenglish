00:00:06 --> 00:00:10
- What you guys doing?- Monica's making us watch "Old Yeller".

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
Why are you guys upset?It's "Old Yeller". It's a happy movie.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
- What?- What are you talking about?

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
Frontier fun!

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
Pheebs, what about the end?

9
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
When Yeller saves the familyand everyone's happy?

10
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
That's not the end.

11
00:00:26 --> 00:00:31
That's when my mother wouldshut off the TV and say, "The end".

12
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
What about when he has rabies?

13
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
He doesn't have rabies.He has babies.

14
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
That's what my mom said.

15
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
I don't think she'd want youto see what's about to happen.

16
00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
Why? What's about to happen?

17
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
I've never seen this part.

18
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
Hey, Travis, what you doingwith that gun?

19
00:00:49 --> 00:00:50
Oh, no.

20
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

21
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
No, no, he's your buddy.He's your Yeller.

22
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
No! The end! The end!

23
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
Okay, what kind of a sickdoggy snuff film is this?

24
00:01:03 --> 00:01:05

Have you guys eaten? Richard and Ijust finished, and we've got leftovers.

27
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
Chicken and potatoes.

28
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
What am I wearing?

29
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

30
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
One of these times, you'll reallybe naked and we won't come over.

31
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
I got a leg, three breastsand a wing.

32
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
How do you find clothes that fit?

33
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
Hey, Monica? We got a question.

34
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
All right, yes, I see other womenin the shower at the gym.

35
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
And no, I don't look.

36
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
No, not that one.

37
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
We're figuring out who to bringto the Nicks game.

38
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
Ross can't go, so it's between my friendEric Prower, who has breath issues...

39
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
...and Dan, with the poking."Did you see that play?"

40
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
"You want more beer?Is that Spike Lee?"

41
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
Why don't you ask Richard?

42
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
Richard, if you had an extraticket to the Nicks game...

43
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
...and you had to choose betweena friend who smelled...

44
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
...and one who bruises you,who would you pick?

45
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
Being a huge Nicks fan myself...

46
00:02:43 --> 00:02:47
...I think you should take someonewho's a huge Nicks fan.

47
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
That's Eric.

48
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
Glad to be of help.Matches.

49
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
I meant, why don't youtake Richard to the game?

50
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
What?

51
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
- I don't know.- Come on!

52
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
He keeps his fingers to himself,and he's always minty fresh.

53
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
Richard's really nice.We just don't know him really well.

54
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
Plus, he's old...

55
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
- er than some people.

56
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
But younger than some buildings.

57
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
So what, he's a little older.Big deal.

58
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
He's important to me.

59
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
If you ask him,he might take you in his Jag.

60
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
How do we say yes...

61
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
...and make it seem like it's notjust to ride in the cool car?

62
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
Okay, this could be tough.

63
00:03:34 --> 00:03:39
We'll bring him,but only if he takes the Jaguar.

64
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
You almost had it.

65
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

66
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
Hi, honey.

67
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
You are not gonna believewhat happened!

68
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
We were playing on the floor,and he grabs the table...

69
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
...and he pulls himself up!

70
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
He pulled himself up!

71
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Standing man!

72
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
I'm sorry you missed it,but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

73
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
We know. He already did it last week.

74
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
You can watch our tape if you want.

75
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
See, I don't believe this.I missed the first time of everything.

76
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
The first time he rolled over,the first time he crawled.

77
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
What else? Has he spoken?Is he driving?

78
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

79
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
He is getting closeron the talking thing.

80
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
He can't quite say "mama" yet,but once he said "Yemen".

81
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
See, I don't know.I'm so sick of missing stuff.

82
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
I want him for more than a day.I want him for a whole weekend.

83
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
Listen. I feel...

84
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
That would be great.

85
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

86
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

87
00:04:43 --> 00:04:44
Did you just see that?

88
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
Did you see? He just waved!He just waved!

89
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
He's never waved before!

90
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
Yes, he has. Very good.

91
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
What you got there?

92
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
Terms of Endearment.

93
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
All you need now is "The Killing Fields"and guacamole, and you got a party!

94
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
I talked to my grandmaabout the "Old Yeller" incident...

95
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
...and she said my mom used to notshow us the ends of sad movies...

96
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
...to shield us fromthe pain and sadness.

97
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
You know, before she killed herself.

98
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
Where's Richard?Did you ditch him?

99
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
After we stole his lunch moneyand gave him a wedgie.

100
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
What's the matter?He's parking the car.

101
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
- Did you guys have fun?- Your boyfriend is so cool.

102
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
He let us drive his Jaguar.Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

103
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
He must like you best.

104
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
What about when he tipped the guywho showed us to our seats?

105
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
You never even saw the money.

106
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
Hey, Chandler, thanks forshowing us to our seats.

107
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
You're welcome. Hey, Joey,thanks for parking the car.

108
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
No problem.

109
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
- Hey, Chandler...- I think they get it.

110
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
There's the man!

111
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
Hey, you're getting better.

112
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
I'm gonna keep this.

113
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
He kept my dollar.

114
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
Your first weekend without Ben.What are you doing?

115
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
We're going tocolonial Williamsburg.

116
00:06:08 --> 00:06:12
A woman I went to college with isthe first female blacksmith there.

117
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
They're a little behind the timesin colonial Williamsburg.

118
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
Look, I better gobefore Mommy starts weeping.

119
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
- We love you.- Bye, Mommy.

120
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
Have a good time.

121
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
Look.

122
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Joey, do you knowwe can see you from here?

123
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
How come Richard looks coolerwith one of these?

124
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
You may wanna light itand lose the spatula.

125
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
It's cute, you tryingto be more like Richard.

126
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
Not like him, per se.

127
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
Just not unlike him.

128
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
It's the artist formerly knownas Chandler.

129
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
I'm just trying something here,you know?

130
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

131
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
We flipped for it.

132
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
I got the cigar,he got the mustache.

133
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
If we both grew them,we'd look like dorks.

134
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
You really sidesteppedthat land mine.

135
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
I promised Richardwe'd meet him downstairs.

136
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
You're meeting Richard?

137
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
- Ranger game.- Didn't he tell you?

138
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
He said he was going out with the guys.I didn't know that was you.

139
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
You hear that?

140
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
We're the guys!

141
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
With that mustache,he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

142
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
Thank you!

143
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
Hi. We're visiting.

144
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
It's Ben and his dada.

145
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Can you say "dada"?

146
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
I'm telling your mommies you said it,so you might as well.

147
00:07:44 --> 00:07:45
No luck, huh?

148
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
A while ago,I got a "seh" out of him...

149
00:07:47 --> 00:07:52
...which I thought might turn into"seh-condary caregiver", but...

150
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
Would you hold him for a sec?I gotta take this off.

151
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
Sure. Okay.

152
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
What are you doing?

153
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
I'm holding Ben.

154
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
He's a baby, not a bomb.

155
00:08:11 --> 00:08:12
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

156
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
This is how I would hold a football.

157
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
Here. Here. There we go.

158
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.I haven't been around them.

159
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
I mean, you know, since I was one.

160
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
- It's all right. No big deal.- Really?

161
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
I'm sure you'll feel differentwhen it's our baby.

162
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
- What?- What?

163
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
You think about stuff like that?

164
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
Yeah. I mean...

165
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
Actually, I kind of thinkthat we'll have two babies.

166
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
Two babies?

167
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
You know, a boy and a girl.

168
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
Hopefully, the girl will come first,so Ben won't feel competitive.

169
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Then what's gonna happen?

170
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,so we'll move to Scarsdale.

171
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
We'll be far enough from our parentsso we don't have to see them...

172
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
...but close enoughthat they can baby-sit.

173
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
And yes, I know the taxes area little higher than Nassau County...

174
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
...but the school system's great.

175
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
Wow, that's great! Great!

176
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
Okay, wow! You know what?

177
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
I'm off my break now.

178
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
Here. You take this.

179
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
I'm gonna go pour thesevery nice people some coffee.

180
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

181
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
I don't have a pot.Maybe I've got one at home.

182
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
Or in Scarsdale.Hey, is that a door?

183
00:09:31 --> 00:09:32
Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

184
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
Murder, cancer, soccer teams eatingeach other in the Andes.

185
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
So you watched the movies?

186
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
What is happening to the world?

187
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
I mean...No, no, because E.T. Leaves...

188
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

189
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
Charlotte who?

190
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
With the web. The spider.

191
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
She dies. She has babies and dies.

192
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
It's like, "Welcome homefrom the hospital." Thud!

193
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
You wanna feel better?

194
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
Here. Watch this.

195
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
It's a Wonderful Life.I've heard of this.

196
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
So you can't lose.It's there in the title.

197
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

198
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
Pride of the Yankees.

199
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
I thought I'd see a filmabout Yankee pride.

200
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
And boom! The guy getsLou Gehrig's disease.

201
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
The guy was Lou Gehrig.Didn't you kind of see it coming?

202
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
Watch that. It'll restoreall your faith in humanity.

203
00:10:22 --> 00:10:23
Hey, big guy. Game time.

204
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
- Hey! Be right there!- There's a game?

205
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
I just got my Pik-Up Stiksback from the shop.

206
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
Bring your nerves of steel.

207
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
It's the basketball playoffs.

208
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
I appreciate this, but you don'thave to hang out with them for me.

209
00:10:38 --> 00:10:39
They have each other.

210
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

211
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
I like hanging out with them.They're different than my other friends.

212
00:10:45 --> 00:10:49
They don't start sentences with"You know who just died shoveling snow?"

213
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
All right, that's great.Then just go.

214
00:10:51 --> 00:10:52
Go Nicks!

215
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
It's the college playoffs.

216
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
- Then, go Vassar!- They're not in it.

217
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
Okay, then just go.

218
00:11:00 --> 00:11:01
Why does this bother me so much?

219
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
I'm not one of those people who wantsto spend 24 hours a day together.

220
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
Sure.

221
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
He just doesn't have much free time.What do I do?

222
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
Does it matter? You'll just dieor divorce or blow your pet's head off.

223
00:11:15 --> 00:11:16
Me too!

224
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
Rachel, I got a question. Richardmade plans again with the guys...

225
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
Ross made plans for the century.

226
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
I'm gonna go read "Cosmo".Maybe there's something helpful in it.

227
00:11:24 --> 00:11:29
If not, I can learn how to do a bikiniwax with leftover Christmas candles.

228
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
What happened back there?

229
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
I don't know. You tell me.

230
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
One minute I'm holding Ben,then I've got two kids...

231
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
...I'm living in Scarsdalecomplaining about taxes!

232
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
Well, I'm sorry.I think about stuff.

233
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
You're at work, you're assembling bones,your mind wanders.

234
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
You've planned out the next 20 years.We've dated for six weeks!

235
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
You never think about our future?

236
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
I think about whose apartmentwe'll sleep at tomorrow...

237
00:11:52 --> 00:11:53
...and where we'll have dinnernext Saturday!

238
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
I do not think aboutour children's names!

239
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
You know what ourchildren's names will be?

240
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
No, I mean, you know. I read a book,and there was a girl named Emily.

241
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
And I thought that might be good.

242
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
What book?

243
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
The Big Book of Children's Names.

244
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
Okay, listen.

245
00:12:13 --> 00:12:14
What we have is amazing.

246
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
But I do not wanteverything decided for me!

247
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
I spent my whole life like that.

248
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
It's what I had with Barry.That's a reason I left.

249
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
I like not knowing right now.

250
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
Sorry if that scares you, but if youwanna be with me, deal with that!

251
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
- Okay, fine!- Thank you!

252
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
- We're not done!- I didn't know that.

253
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
You're with a guy who won't stopplanning his future with you.

254
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
He knows we'll end up together.

255
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
If that scares you, tough!You'll have to deal with that.

256
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
- I will!- Good, because I love you!

257
00:12:39 --> 00:12:40
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

258
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
- That's the first time we've said that!- Yes, it is!

259
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
- I'm gonna kiss you!- You better!

260
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
Thanks for the great movie tip.

261
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
- Did you like it?- Oh, yeah.

262
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
I don't know if I was happier whenGeorge Bailey destroyed the business...

263
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
...or Donna Reed cried or whenthe pharmacist made his ear bleed.

264
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
I'll give you the ear thing,but wasn't the ending wonderful?

265
00:13:04 --> 00:13:05
I didn't watch it.I was too depressed.

266
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
It kept getting worse!It should've been called:

267
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When YouThink It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

268
00:13:13 --> 00:13:14
Kick, save! And...

269
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
...denied!

270
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
He gets it back.Pass to the middle, lines it up...

271
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
Yes!

272
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
Could that shot be any prettier?

273
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
Man, you are incredible.

274
00:13:25 --> 00:13:26
We had a table in college.

275
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
Really? I didn't know they hadfoosball in the 1800s.

276
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
Nice mustache. At puberty,that thing will really kick in.

277
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,but dinner's on the table.

278
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
One more point.

279
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
Score!

280
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
Now can we go?

281
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
That's why we don't let her play.

282
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
Is everything all right?

283
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
Don't be mad at him.It's our fault.

284
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

285
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
He's just really greatto hang out with.

286
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
- Well...- No, seriously.

287
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
We just talked about this.He is so much cooler than our dads.

288
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
Our dads are okay and all,but Richard is just...

289
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
What are you kicking me for?

290
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
I'm trying to talk here.

291
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
You guys see me as a dad?

292
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
- Oh, yeah!- No!

293
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
You're just clearly not familiarwith our young persons' vernacular.

294
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
When we say "dad", we mean "buddy".

295
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
We mean "pal".

296
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

297
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
Monica's my dad.

298
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
I've even got some dads down at work.

299
00:14:38 --> 00:14:38
That's fine.

300
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
Well, your other dad and I are gonnago have a romantic evening.

301
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
I'll just see you kids around.

302
00:14:44 --> 00:14:45
Nighty-night.

303
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
You're not a dad!

304
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
I can't believe you got usinto trouble.

305
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
So are you okay?

306
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
Just...

307
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
...I feel like I'm about a hundred.

308
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
I thought I was just one of the guys.

309
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
Come here.

310
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
I'll make you feel likeone of the guys.

311
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
For a really cool guy,you suck at foosball.

312
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
I was killing them.

313
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
Yeah, well they suck too.

314
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
You take the poopy diaperand put it in the poopy diaper pail.

315
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
Calling it a "poopy diaper"doesn't make this process any cuter.

316
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
- It's us.- Come on up.

317
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33
I'll get his stuff together.

318
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
Okay, we can do this now,can't we, Ben?

319
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
Yes, we can.

320
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
Yes, we can.

321
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
There! I did it!

322
00:15:43 --> 00:15:44
I did it!

323
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
Look at that!

324
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
It stays on and everything.

325
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
I'm sorry. What did you just say?Did you just say "hi"?

326
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
Oh, my God! Ross?Ben just said hi!

327
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
- What?- Ben just said hi!

328
00:16:00 --> 00:16:01
What, the word "hi"?

329
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
No, my Uncle Hi.

330
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
Great! And I missed that too.I miss everything!

331
00:16:06 --> 00:16:10
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I justbring it out in him.

332
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
- Where is he?- We missed you.

333
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
We missed you so much!Come here, Ben.

334
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
Guess what?Ben just said his first word.

335
00:16:18 --> 00:16:19
What did he say?

336
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Something about hi.

337
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
That's so exciting!Mommy's so proud of you!

338
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
You know, actually,it's more like, hi!

339
00:16:32 --> 00:16:33
This could go on for a while.

340
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
You're right.We've got a cab waiting.

341
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
Well, this was fun.

342
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
We should do it again sometime, Ben.What do you say?

343
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
- All right, so I've got him...?- Tuesday.

344
00:16:43 --> 00:16:44
Bye, you guys.

345
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
- Take care.- Bye, Ben.

346
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
Did he just say "bye"?

347
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
He said bye!

348
00:16:52 --> 00:16:53
You said bye!He said bye to me!

349
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
Yes, he did!

350
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
Suddenly I'm seeing himgo off to college!

351
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
We've gotta go.We've got that cab downstairs.

352
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
See you later.

353
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
Hey, Bert...

354
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
... isn't this a nice hole here?

355
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buriesBert in the sand and can't find him.

356
00:17:26 --> 00:17:31
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,and he does find him again.

357
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
But before that happens,there's some rough going for a while.

358
00:17:34 --> 00:17:35
But I think we can handle it.

359
00:17:36 --> 00:17:40
And there's just the alphabet,but we know that ends well, so...

360
00:17:40 --> 00:17:41
Here we go.

361
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
Bert? Bert?

362
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
He was here just a moment ago.

363
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

364
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
I'm so glad you're here.

365
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
Bye-bye, baby.
