1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
I'm having dinner with my dadtomorrow. Wanna come?

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
Sure. He's kind of sexy.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
I'll be there too.

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:15
So we'll come up with a signal.If it's going well, you can take off.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
I need your support.I haven't told him I'm pregnant.

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
Oh. Why not?

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
He's gonna flip out.I hate it when he's angry.

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
This is all so "Papa Don't Preach."

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
He's scary.Once, he caught me smoking.

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
He said if I did it again,he'd make me eat the pack.

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Wow. Well, I will be there.

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
I won't let that manmake you eat your baby!

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
Hey, who is that guy?I think I know him.

14
00:00:41 --> 00:00:42
No, you don't.

15
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripperfrom your bachelorette party!

16
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
Her what?

17
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
Your secret bachelorette party.

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
- Bachelorette party?- She untied his G-string with her teeth.

19
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
Somebody stop me!

20
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
We weren't gonna have parties.We agreed that it's a silly tradition.

21
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
It's a grand tradition!

22
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
They surprised me.There was nothing I could do.

23
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
You could've untied itwith your hands.

24
00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
This is so unfair. I wantedto throw a bachelor party...

25
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
...but I wasn't allowed.All we got was dinner.

26
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
You went home with the waitress.

27
00:01:22 --> 00:01:24
Yeah, that was a good night.

28
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
Why didn't you tell me?

29
00:01:26 --> 00:01:30
The two pillars of marriageare openness and honesty.

30
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
I knew giving you that book wouldcome back and bite me in the ass.

00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
- I'll order everyone the chicken.- Oh, I don't eat meat.

35
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
It's chicken!

36
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
- I don't eat that either.- I never understand you lesbians.

37
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
- So, what's new with you?- Well, actually...

38
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
Your '74 Lafite, sir.

39
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
I ordered the '75. That's amagnificent wine. '74 is sewage!

40
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
Why would you bring me sewage?

41
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
Are you an idiot?Is that why you're a waiter?

42
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
This is why I didn't wantto wait on you.

43
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
Oh, come on.Don't be such a baby.

44
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
In case you didn't notice,that is a scary man.

45
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
He's right, though.The '74 is absolute piss.

46
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
This was a huge mistake.I can't tell him. I can't.

47
00:02:50 --> 00:02:51
Rachel...

48
00:02:51 --> 00:02:56
I'm gonna wait a couple of years,and then the baby will tell him.

49
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
- Why? So he can get mad at the baby?- That's the baby's problem.

50
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
- Everything okay with the waiter?- I don't know. I went to the bathroom.

51
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
So, sweetie, you were startingto tell me what's new with you.

52
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
I got TiVo.

53
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
- What's TiVo?- It's slang for "pregnant."

54
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Are you pregnant?

55
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Well, yes and no.

56
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
Except, not no.

57
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
So to sum it up, yeah.

58
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
Who is the father?Please don't tell me it's her!

59
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
No, it's Ross. You like Ross.

60
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
I hope you're okay with this.

61
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
This is a good thing.This is your first grandchild!

62
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
You're gonna be a poppy!

63
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
That's true. I'm a poppy!

64
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
I'm gonna be a poppy!

65
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
- So when is the wedding?- The who?

66
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
The wedding.There's going to be a wedding.

67
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
Young lady, don't you tell me my firstgrandchild is gonna be a bastard!

68
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
- Tell me there's gonna be a wedding!- February 2nd!

69
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
It was cool seeing you lecture today.

70
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
Thanks. Although it seemed likeyou were falling asleep.

71
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
No, I had my eyes closed so I couldconcentrate and take it all in.

72
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
A lot of my students do that.

73
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
- I've got to get going.- I'll see you tonight?

74
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
Thanks for showing me your semipreciousstone collection. It was amazing.

75
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
My God, you must be good in bed.

76
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
So you and Mona. It's been a while.How is it?

77
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
It's going good.

78
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
I mean, we get along great.She's so...

79
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
- Hot?- I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!

80
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
She's okay with the baby?

81
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
I haven't actually told her yet.I don't wanna scare her off.

82
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
You have to be honest, or you maythink you're on the same path...

83
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
...but you're on different ones.

84
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
I'm gonna take that bookand beat you to death with it.

85
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
You are gonna love me so much.

86
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
I felt bad aboutthe bachelorette party...

87
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
...so tonight you're gonna havea bachelor party.

88
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
I got this number from a guy at workand I hired a stripper for you.

89
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
I'm going in the wife hall of fame!

90
00:05:25 --> 00:05:29
- Honey, I don't want a stripper.- Will you let the lady talk?

91
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Come on, it'll be fun.It'll make me feel better.

92
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
I appreciate it, but it's a littlecreepy. I'm not a bachelor anymore.

93
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
Just think of it asa two-month anniversary present.

94
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
Sure. One year is paper,but two months is lap dance.

95
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
Please, I feel so bad.Just watch the hot woman get naked!

96
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
- Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.- Yeah!

97
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
And Joey.

98
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
- Who else do you wanna invite?- Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.

99
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
I can't make it.I'm seeing Mona tonight.

100
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
Why cancel a real dateto go to a fake bachelor party?

101
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
I'm sorry.I gotta cancel tonight, baby.

102
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
I'm sorry I won't make it to yourimaginary wedding. I'm busy that day.

103
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
I already have a unicorn baptismand a leprechaun bar mitzvah.

104
00:06:23 --> 00:06:24
I know. I panicked.

105
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
I didn't want him yelling at melike I was some '74 Latour.

106
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
It's Lafite.

107
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
The '74 Latour is actuallydrinking quite nicely.

108
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
I'm gonna tell him.I'm gonna be strong.

109
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
I just called a friend.

110
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
I think I may be ableto book the Plaza on short notice.

111
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
Really?

112
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
The Plaza?

113
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
Oh, Daddy!

114
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
- Daddy, I need to talk to you.- What is it, sweetie?

115
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
Ross and I aren't getting married.

116
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
- I'm sorry.- I don't believe this!

117
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
- Stay calm, please.- How do you expect me to stay calm?

118
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
This is unacceptable, Rachel.And I wanna know why!

119
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
Is it because that punkwon't marry you?

120
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
- Is that it?- Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.

121
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
You nervous about getting married?

122
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
What are you doing?

123
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
Pretend it's a real bachelor party.It'll be more fun.

124
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
All right. I can't believetomorrow's the big day.

125
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
You're never gonna bewith another woman.

126
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
You have to wake upto the same face every day...

127
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
...until you finally havethe sweet release of death.

128
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
You're right. This is more fun.

129
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
That's her! Okay, come on!

130
00:07:56 --> 00:07:57
Which one of you is Chandler?

131
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
That's me!

132
00:08:00 --> 00:08:01
That's me.

133
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.

134
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
- Is that a bedroom?- Yeah, right over there.

135
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
Whenever you're ready.

136
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
That was weird.

137
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
- Why would she go in the bedroom?- I'm waiting.

138
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
- So she's a...- Yeah, that's one naked hooker.

139
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
I love your place.Where is this guy from?

140
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
That's an 18th-century artifactfrom Calcutta.

141
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
Oh. Wow.

142
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
So you're more than just dinosaurs.

143
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
So much more.

144
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

145
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
Forget it. It's from Pier 1.

146
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
Sorry.

147
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
Think you can knock up my daughterand not marry her?

148
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
I ought to kill you!

149
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
This is actually nota great time for me.

150
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
So come on.Explain yourself, Geller.

151
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
- You got Rachel pregnant!- You got her pregnant?

152
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
- Who did?- You did!

153
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
Yes, but it was a one-night thing.It meant nothing.

154
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
Oh? Really? My daughter means nothing?

155
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
No, sir. She means a lot to me.I love Rachel.

156
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
- What?- But not that way.

157
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
I'm not in love.I love her like a friend.

158
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
So you get her in troubleand refuse to marry her?

159
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
I offered to marry her.But I didn't want to.

160
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
Why not? You wanted to bewith this tramp?

161
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
Tramp?

162
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona.Mona, Dr. Green.

163
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
I can't believe there isa naked hooker in there!

164
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
Maybe she's a hookerand a stripper...

165
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
...but she got confusedabout what to do.

166
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
Maybe. Technically, she stripped.We just missed it.

167
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
Ma'am?

168
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
Are you also a stripper?

169
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
No, but I can pretend to strip.Costs extra.

170
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
Here's the extras:Handcuffs, spanking...

171
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.

172
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
Getting her husband a hooker.That's pretty funny.

173
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
That is funny. Maybe for my birthdayshe'll murder someone.

174
00:10:25 --> 00:10:29
I'll bet Ross was in on it.He was conveniently busy.

175
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
- You mind if I smoke in here?- Actually, I'd rather...

176
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
Go ahead. We're gonna have toburn that room, anyway.

177
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
- How could you hide this?- I wanted to tell you, but...

178
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
You'd get what you wanted,then dump her, like Rachel.

179
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
Hey, I did not dump Rachel.Nor are we still together.

180
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
Can l...?

181
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
We'll just let the machine get that.

182
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
There's a hooker here.

183
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
know something about it.

184
00:11:01 --> 00:11:02
No! No! No!

185
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
No!

186
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
I need to lie down.

187
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
Tonight's the bachelor party?

188
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
- Thanks for that number.- No problem. Who's the party for?

189
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
- My husband.- You hired your husband a hooker?

190
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
- She's a stripper.- No, a hooker.

191
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
- Is that a name for strippers?- Lf they're hookers.

192
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
Stu, I can't believe you did this.

193
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
You're sure she's a hooker?

194
00:11:28 --> 00:11:32
Either that, or she's the best,most expensive date I ever had.

195
00:11:34 --> 00:11:38
- Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.- Why would she do that?

196
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
Maybe she wants youto learn something.

197
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
Is there anythingyou're really bad at, sexually?

198
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
This is the worstbachelor party ever.

199
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
- What's taking you boys so long?- In a minute!

200
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
What's gonna happen in a minute?

201
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
You should ask her to leave.

202
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
- Why me?- It's your party.

203
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
- Which is why you should do it.- No, you do it.

204
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
Rock, paper, scissorsfor who tells the whore to leave.

205
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
- What?- I miss this.

206
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
I don't think we'vedone this before.

207
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17

208
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
- We still hang out.- Not like we used to.

209
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
Remember? We used to be inseparable.

210
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
You know, now it's likethings are different.

211
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29

212
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32

214
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
Yeah, I miss that too.

215
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
From now on,we'll make time to hang out.

216
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
You got it. Come here.

217
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
Oh, God.

218
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
Listen, I am this closeto robbing you guys.

219
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
She's a hooker!She's a...

220
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

221
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
So your dad dropped by.

222
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
He's a pleasant man.

223
00:13:06 --> 00:13:09
- Oh, no.- I better go.

224
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
Just over here.I can't miss the fight.

225
00:13:17 --> 00:13:18
Ross, I am so sorry.

226
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
I'll straighten this outtomorrow in person.

227
00:13:21 --> 00:13:22
Or via e-mail.

228
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
I don't care about your dad.Mona is totally freaked out!

229
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
I'll fix that too.What's her e-mail?

230
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
I'll fix this.I swear I'll talk to her.

231
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
Okay. Thank you.

232
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
That's it?You call that a fight?

233
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
"We were on a break!" "No we weren't!"What happened to you two?

234
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
Thank you so muchfor coming back over.

235
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
Oh, good. You're here.

236
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
And I was worried thatit would be uncomfortable.

237
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
Mona, just hear me out.

238
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
I'm sorry about my fatheryelling at you.

239
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
But you held your own.You have to tell me how.

240
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
- Focus.- Okay.

241
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
Yes, Ross and I used to date.

242
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.

243
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
But we are definitely notgetting back together.

244
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
- How can I be sure?- We drove each other crazy.

245
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
He was possessive, jealous.He couldn't let the little things go.

246
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
Trying to date this woman.

247
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
None of that comparedto how kind and gentle...

248
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
...and thoughtful he is.

249
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
You probably shouldn't touch me.

250
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
I don't want something so complicated.

251
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
But what relationshipis not complicated?

252
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
We all have our baggage.You must too.

253
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
Why else would you still be single?

254
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
I'm so gonna leave right now.

255
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
Should I leave this open?

256
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
I'm not sure.Why didn't you just tell me?

257
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
It has nothing to dowith how I feel.

258
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
- You still should have told me.- I was going to...

259
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
...but I thought you should hear itfrom Rachel's father.

260
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
I made a mistake...

261
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
...but it's only becauseI really like you. Really.

262
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
Okay. I guess you canclose the door now.

263
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
Forgot my purse.Oh, you guys made up.

264
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
Good kisser, isn't he?I'm going!

265
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
I swear I didn't knowshe was a hooker.

266
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
You let her smoke?

267
00:15:41 --> 00:15:46
Her ass-print is still on our quilt.Really want to talk about smoking?

268
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
I'm gonna make this up to you.

269
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
I promised a stripper...

270
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
...and you're gonna get a stripper.

271
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
- Monica, wait.- What?

272
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
Carry on.

273
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
These tennis shoes are so tight.

274
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
- I think I'll take them off.- Could you not narrate?

275
00:16:21 --> 00:16:22
Gotcha, sailor.

276
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
you're not in love...

277
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
- You told your dad the truth.- An hour ago.

278
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
- Wanna go see a movie?- Yes.

279
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
Bye, Dad.

280
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49

281
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
than love.

282
00:16:55 --> 00:16:59
the consequences of your decisions!

283
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
I do think aboutthe consequences of my decisions!

284
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
What gives you the right to...?

285
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
Go to hell!

286
00:17:11 --> 00:17:16
Stupid guy on my phone.
