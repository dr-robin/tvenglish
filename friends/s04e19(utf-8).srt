1
00:00:05 --> 00:00:09
Morning's here

2
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
The morning's here

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
Sunshine is here

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
The sky is clear

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
The morning's here

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
The morning's here

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
Do you have to do that?It's Saturday!

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
Oh, come on!

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
Morning's here!

10
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
I hate this apartment!

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
I hate this wall color!I hate that it still smells like bird!

12
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
I hate that singing guy!

13
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

14
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
Morning's here

15
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Stop it!

16
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
I will kill you.

17
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
I hate that my room is so small.

18
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
I have all the space I need.Do what I did.

19
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
You don't even have a bed.You sleep in a ball on the floor!

20
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
I am tired of your bellyaching.

21
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
I've worked hard to make thisa nice place for us.

22
00:01:10 --> 00:01:11
I know.I'm so sorry.

23
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
I'm sorry, okay?

24
00:01:13 --> 00:01:14
It's a great apartment!

25
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
Shut up!This place is a hole!

26
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
The One with All the Haste

27
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
I still can't believeyou've got an earring!

28
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
I know, I know.Who am I? David Bowie?

29
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
He does that?

30
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
I don't know. Whatever.

31
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
I think it makes you lookreally dangerous.

32
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
Oh, I know.

33
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
You know what?

34
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
I never would've gotten thisif it weren't for you.

35
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
When I'm with you, I'm like...

36
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
...this whole other guy.I love that guy!

37
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
I mean, I love you too.A lot.

38
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
But that guy!

39
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
I love that guy!

40
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
I love both of you.

41
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
I wish I didn't have to go.

42
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
Then don't.

43
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
Stay here.Don't go so soon to London.

44
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
Just one more day.

45
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
Please don't do this to me again.

46
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
I'd stay, but I've already missedso much work. They'll fire me.

47
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
So? Then you could stayas long as you want.

48
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
I wish I could.

49
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
Oh, no. Don't start packing.

50
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
Come on!

51
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
I don't think you understand packing.

52
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
I don't want to leave it till last.Last time, I left my knickers here.

53
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
Yeah, I know.I tried them on.

54
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
You didn't!

55
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
No, I didn't.I didn't want to be "that guy".

56
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
Excuse me?

57
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
Your pants.

58
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
Oh yeah! You like them?

59
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
I went to a used-clothes storeand got maternity stuff.

60
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
These are so comfortable.

61
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
Pheebs, those are Santa pants.

62
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
Santa pants.

63
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
Santa Claus' pants.

64
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
No. They're maternity pants.

65
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
They even came witha list of baby names. See?

66
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
These names are good,and these are bad.

67
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
So, how are the elves?

68
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
I don't know.How are the... you know?

69
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
Your clothes aren't funny.

70
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
What should I wear to a Knicks game?

71
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
A T-shirt that says,"I Don't Belong Here"?

72
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
You have tickets?

73
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
Mom got Dad's season tickets inthe divorce, so she gave them to me.

74
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
Apparently, they're good seats.

75
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
Oh, my God!Those are almost on the floor!

76
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Do you guys want these?

77
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
Yeah, we do!

78
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
Well, you got them!

79
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
Just give us our apartment back.

80
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
Oh, I didn't see that coming.

81
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
Are you serious?

82
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
Come on.We know what these are worth.

83
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
Do you think we're stupid?

84
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
Not stupid.You're meaner than I thought.

85
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
What do you say?

86
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
Forget it. I'm not giving up mybachelor pad for basketball seats.

87
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
Your "bachelor pad"?

88
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
Have you even had a girl here?

89
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
No.

90
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
But Joey has, and I usuallytalk to them in the morning.

91
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
Yeah, you do!

92
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
Come on!

93
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
Gunther, can I gettwo cups of chino, please?

94
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Good one.

95
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
Come on.Season tickets!

96
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
Season tickets!You know what that means?

97
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
I'm not giving up the apartment.

98
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
When I was a kid, my dad's companygave season tickets...

99
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
...to the No. 1 salesmanevery year. My dad never won.

100
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
Of course, he wasn't in sales.But still, I never forgot that!

101
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
Hey guys!

102
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Oh, my God!

103
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
We don't make enoughfun of you already?

104
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Oh, yeah.Emily convinced me to do it.

105
00:05:40 --> 00:05:44
You do know that Wham broke up?

106
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
I like it. Emily likes it.That's what counts.

107
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
So, how are you guys doing?

108
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
Don't try and talk all normalwith that thing in your ear.

109
00:05:55 --> 00:05:56
Where's Emily?

110
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
She's saying goodbyeto her uncle.

111
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
Didn't she, like, just get here?

112
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
Easy, tiger.

113
00:06:03 --> 00:06:04
I just hate this so much.

114
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
Every time I go pick her up atthe airport, it's so great.

115
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right backin a couple of days, dropping her off."

116
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
- So what'll you do?- There's nothing to do.

117
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
She lives there.I live here.

118
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
She'd have to move here.

119
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
She should move here.

120
00:06:20 --> 00:06:20
What?

121
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
- I can ask her to live with me.- Are you serious?

122
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
- I mean, why not?- You've only known her six weeks!

123
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
I've got a carton of milk in my fridgeI've had a longer relationship with.

124
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
Look, guys, when I'm with her,it's like...

125
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
She brings out this great side of me.

126
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
I mean, I love her, you know?

127
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
And I love the milk!

128
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
But I won't ask some British girlto move in with me.

129
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
Joey, you say things now.

130
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
Look, Ross. He's right.Emily's great.

131
00:06:51 --> 00:06:52
She's great!

132
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
But this is too soon.You'll only scare her.

133
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
I don't want to do that.

134
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
You don't want to wreck it.Don't go too fast.

135
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
No. You're right.I know, you're right.

136
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
I'm not going to do it.

137
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
- Thanks guys.- No problem.

138
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
Just remember to wake us upbefore you go-go.

139
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
It's too hard. Too hard!

140
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
All right.Last chance for the tickets.

141
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
Otherwise, I give them to mynew boyfriend, Joshua.

142
00:07:27 --> 00:07:28
No, thank you.

143
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!Let's trade.

144
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
The timing's perfect!I just clogged the toilet!

145
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
I want those seats. But we can't livein the small apartment...

146
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
...after living here!Ever read "Flowers for Algernon"?

147
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
Ever read "Sports Illustrated"?

148
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
No, I didn't read yours!

149
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
We can go to the game tonight!

150
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
The only way I'll consider this is...

151
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
...if they offer morethan just season seats.

152
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
It's the Knicks!

153
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
Screw the Knicks!

154
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
I didn't mean that.I just meant that...

155
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
...the apartment is worthso much more.

156
00:08:07 --> 00:08:08
And the Knicks rule.

157
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

158
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
So? Are you going to do it?

159
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
No, we're not going tobecause it's not an even trade.

160
00:08:16 --> 00:08:16
All right, look.

161
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
What if you could keep the apartmentand the tickets?

162
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
Done!

163
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.Winner takes all.

164
00:08:24 --> 00:08:24
We could get nothing.

165
00:08:25 --> 00:08:26
Or everything.

166
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
I like that.

167
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
What do you say?

168
00:08:30 --> 00:08:31
Just do it!

169
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
Oh! I'm convinced!

170
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
Come on, man!You know I'd do it for you.

171
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
Because you're my best friend.

172
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
All right. But you can'tuse that again for a whole year.

173
00:08:43 --> 00:08:44
I'm in.

174
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
This is so exciting!What are you going to bet?

175
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
We should let Phoebe decide...

176
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
...because she's the only onewho's impartial, and she's so pretty.

177
00:08:55 --> 00:08:56
I have a game!

178
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
- This is great!- What's the game?

179
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
It doesn't have a name.No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

180
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
No, it doesn't have a name.

181
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
What is your favorite thingabout trees?

182
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
- They're green?- Good! Five points!

183
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
Same question.

184
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
- They're tall.- Three points!

185
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
Both fine answers, but we werelooking for leafy. Leafy.

186
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
That's not even a game.

187
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
Shut up. We're winning!

188
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
You want to finish this?We get a deck of cards.

189
00:09:39 --> 00:09:40
High card wins.What do you say?

190
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
- Let's do it!- Oh, I have cards!

191
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
Yeah. Here.

192
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
No, these are the trick deck.

193
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
Here, yes.

194
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
Okay, you guys pick first.

195
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
- Four.- That's a low one!

196
00:09:58 --> 00:09:59
You look.I can't do it.

197
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
What makes you think I can?

198
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
Ace!

199
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
Why are you hugging?

200
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
We won our apartment back!

201
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
What? Ace is high!Jack, queen, king, ace!

202
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
No! Ace is low!Ace, two, three, four!

203
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
I don't know.

204
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
Look it!

205
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
Come on, pick again!

206
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
Come on, apartment!Come on, apartment!

207
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
I know queen is high!

208
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
Not as high as...

209
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
It worked! King!

210
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
We pick again!We pick again!

211
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
- Why?- I don't know.

212
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
Tickets, please.

213
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
Courtside, baby!

214
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
Seriously, good game, though.Good game.

215
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
What are they so mad about?They got the apartment back.

216
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
No, they didn't.

217
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Packed while you were gone.

218
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
I left knickers under your pillow.

219
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
Move in with me?

220
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
What?

221
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,and people will say it's too soon...

222
00:11:23 --> 00:11:28
...but just think.Think how great it would be.

223
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
I don't know.

224
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
Leaving London...

225
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
My whole family lives there...

226
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
- My job.- You'll get a job here.

227
00:11:37 --> 00:11:41
I always hear about them foreignersstealing American jobs.

228
00:11:41 --> 00:11:42
That could be you.

229
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
Yeah, but it's my whole life.

230
00:11:45 --> 00:11:46
You come to England.

231
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
I would. I really would.But my son is here.

232
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
I can't leave him.You don't think there's any way?

233
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
I don't think so.

234
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
It would be different if it wasway into the future...

235
00:11:59 --> 00:12:00
...and we were getting married.

236
00:12:01 --> 00:12:02
What?

237
00:12:02 --> 00:12:07
Right. I shouldn't have said "married".Please don't go freaky on me.

238
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
I didn't mean it.I take it back.

239
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
No. Don't.

240
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
Why don't we?

241
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
Why don't we what?

242
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
Get married.

243
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
You are mad!

244
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
No, I'm not! It's perfect.It's better than you moving here.

245
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
It's us together forever,and that's what I want.

246
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
- We've known each other six weeks!- I know.

247
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
So what? Who's to say?Does that mean we can't do it?

248
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
Look. I was with Carol forfour years before we got married...

249
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
...and I wound up divorcedfrom a pregnant lesbian.

250
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
I mean, this...

251
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
This makes sense for us.

252
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
Our first date, we ended upspending the whole weekend in Vermont.

253
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced.Me!

254
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
This feels right.

255
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
Doesn't it?

256
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
My parents will be really mad.

257
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
Are you saying, "Yes"?Is that "Yes"?

258
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
Yes.

259
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
- We're getting married!- Oh, my God!

260
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
We're getting married!

261
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
Come here, come here.

262
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
Emily, will you marry me?

263
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
It's a bit small.

264
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
Damn! I thought that'd beromantic as hell.

265
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
It was.

266
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
Those were, like,the best seats ever!

267
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
Should we give these to the girls?Like a peace offering?

268
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
That's very nice.Plus, they were free and too small.

269
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
Oh, God!

270
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
Hey, you want a beer?

271
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
I know!

272
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
Open up! Open up! Open up!

273
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
We'll discuss it in the morning.

274
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
What the hell is going on?

275
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
We took our apartment back!

276
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
I had nothing to do with it.

277
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
Okay, it was my idea.But I don't feel good about it.

278
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
We are switching back right now.

279
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
No, we're not.We're not leaving!

280
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
You'll have to.You both have jobs.

281
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
As soon as you do, we'll switch back!You can't stop us.

282
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
Right, Joe?

283
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
I don't know.

284
00:14:56 --> 00:14:57
What?

285
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
I don't want to move again, with...

286
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
This is our apartmentand they stole...

287
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
You stole!

288
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
Our apartment!We won it fair and square. Twice!

289
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
And I am getting it back right now!I'm getting it back right now!

290
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
All right.

291
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
We figured you might respondthis way, so we have a backup offer.

292
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
No more offers.You can't offer anything to us!

293
00:15:20 --> 00:15:25
- Let us keep the apartment and...- As a thank you...

294
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
...Rachel and I will kissfor one minute.

295
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
- Totally worth it!- That was one good minute!

296
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
Good night.

297
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
- Men are such idiots.- I know.

298
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
Can you believe something that stupidactually got us our apartment back?

299
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
If you had just done thatafter the last contest...

300
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
...no one would havehad to move at all.

301
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
Let's pretend that's not true.

302
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
Scarf's done.

303
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
Come on, come on!

304
00:16:06 --> 00:16:06
What's going on?

305
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
Ross has some big thingto tell everyone.

306
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
Emily and I, we decided...

307
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
...to get married.

308
00:16:18 --> 00:16:19
What?

309
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
Oh, are you pregnant too?

310
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
When did...How did you...

311
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
We just decided to go for it.

312
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
We know it's a bit hasty...

313
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
...but it just feels so right.

314
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
I was just telling the guys...

315
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
Yeah, I heard.

316
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
I think it's great!

317
00:16:48 --> 00:16:49
I'm so happy for you!

318
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
Well, yeah!Congratulations!

319
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
I can't believeyou're getting married!

320
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
Monica and Rachel made out.

321
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
Morning's here

322
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18

324
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22

325
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
The morning's here

326
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
- Hey, get into gear

327

Breakfast is near

328
00:17:29 --> 00:17:33
