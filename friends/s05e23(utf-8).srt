1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
Could you get that?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:09
Why? Just because you're too lazyto get up off your tushy?

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
All the people in the entire world thatI would wanna talk to are right here.

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Sucker!

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
- Hey, Pheebs.

6
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
Can you do me a favor?

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
I forgot the PIN to my ATM card.Can you get it for me?

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
Sure. Where is it?

9
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
I scratched it on the ATM machineon the corner.

10
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
So you're 5-6-3-9?

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
That's it! Thanks.

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
- Wanna talk to Chandler?- Let me talk to him.

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
He didn't believe in my movie...

14
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
...which is a big mistake,because it is real. Real.

15
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
Tribbiani, get back to work.Break time's over.

16
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
Who was that?

17
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
My stunt double. He's gettingtoo familiar for my taste.

18
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
I've tried to apologize.

19
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
If I can't do it on the phone,I'll go and do it in person.

20
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
I heard that. Can you put him on?

21
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
Don't come out here.

22
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
I support you 100% and I wanna provethat to you in person.

23
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
I got that. I forgive you.Don't come out here.

24
00:01:08 --> 00:01:09
You haven't takenmy calls for a week.

25
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
I'm totally over it. Friends forever.Don't come out here.

26
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
Would you mind doinga picture with us?

27
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
What was that?

28
00:01:17 --> 00:01:20
Entertainment Tonight.

29
00:01:20 --> 00:01:24
Good talking to youand don't come out here.

30
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
The One in Vegas

31
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
I'm sorry I'm late.

32
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
I'm so sorry.Have you been here long?

33
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
That's okay.

34
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
What the hell took you so long?

35
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
You can't tell Chandler.I ran into Richard.

36
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
- Which Richard?- The Richard.

37
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!

38
00:02:28 --> 00:02:32
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.You know, the tall guy, mustache.

39
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
Okay, that actuallymakes more sense.

40
00:02:34 --> 00:02:34
How was it?

41
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
It was really nice. We talkedand I had lunch with him.

42
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
That's weird. I dreamedyou had lunch with Richard.

43
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
- Really?- Again, Richard Simmons.

44
00:02:43 --> 00:02:43
Go on.

45
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
The strange part washe was really nice...

46
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
...and he looks great,but I didn't feel anything.

47
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
So why can't we tell Chandler?

48
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's ouranniversary. I don't wanna spoil it.

49
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
I can't believe you guyshave lasted a whole year!

50
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Wow, I owe Rachel twenty bucks.

51
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
On a totally different bet.

52
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
- It's almost our anniversary!- I know.

53
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
One year ago today, I was justyour annoying friend Chandler.

54
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
Now you're justmy annoying friend Chandler.

55
00:03:14 --> 00:03:14
I got you a gift.

56
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
- It's not till tomorrow.- I know, but you have to open it today.

57
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
Okay! There you go!

58
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
It's two tickets to Vegas!

59
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
Yeah! For this weekend!It'll be perfect.

60
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll startour celebration on the plane.

61
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
We can call it our "Plane-a-versary".

62
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
We have to?

63
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
This is great, but Joey didn't wantany of us there.

64
00:03:47 --> 00:03:50
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.He'll be excited when we surprise him.

65
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
Plus, we get to haveour own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!

66
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
"Anna-vada-versary!"

67
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
I think we should see other people.

68
00:04:00 --> 00:04:01
We can go, right?

69
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
Great idea.

70
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
I'm gonna go too!

71
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
Pheebs, it's kind ofour anniversary.

72
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
You won't ditch melike you did with London.

73
00:04:11 --> 00:04:12
Ditch you?You were pregnant...

74
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
Great story. I'm going.

75
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna goto Las Vegas to surprise Joey!

76
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Including me!

77
00:04:24 --> 00:04:25
Do you wanna go?

78
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
I can take a couple days off work.

79
00:04:27 --> 00:04:31
Of course you can take a couple daysoff, because this trip includes me!

80
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
I've got a presentation tomorrow.I can't miss that.

81
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
I've got tickets to the Van Goghexhibit. I waited a year for this.

82
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Art lover.

83
00:04:43 --> 00:04:44
What?

84
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
I said, "Art lover."

85
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
Is that an insult?

86
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
I don't know. I'm very tired.

87
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?

88
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
Sounds great.

89
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
I'll call the airlines.

90
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
That'll be nice to havethe apartment to myself.

91
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
To walk around naked.

92
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
No, so I can be by myself.Have a little alone time.

93
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
Naked alone time.

94
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
Just because I'm alone doesn't meanI wanna walk around naked.

95
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
You live alone,you don't walk around naked.

96
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
Why does it takes me so longto answer the door?

97
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
So far, is this trip to Las Vegasbetter or worse than the trip to London?

98
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
So far, it's pretty muchthe same, Pheebs.

99
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
What about after I give youthese candies?

100
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
I guess it's a little better now.

101
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
Las Vegas, 1.London, 0.

102
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
I'll be back.

103
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
Happy Plane-a-versary.

104
00:05:43 --> 00:05:44
I love you.

105
00:05:44 --> 00:05:48
- Can I give you your present now?- Okay!

106
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
Oh, don't tell me I did this.

107
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!

108
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
How about "I did forget the present,forgive me" not fake-out?

109
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
You can give it to mewhen we get back.

110
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
This is the worst thingthat could happen.

111
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
You decided to tell himabout the Richard thing.

112
00:06:08 --> 00:06:09
What "Richard thing"?

113
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Oh, no.

114
00:06:13 --> 00:06:13
What "Richard thing"?

115
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
Simmons. Go with Simmons.

116
00:06:21 --> 00:06:22
I ran into Richard yesterday.

117
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
He asked me if I wanted to gofor a bite and I did.

118
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
I didn't tell youbecause you'd get mad...

119
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
...and I didn't wanna spoilour anniversary.

120
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
I'm not mad.

121
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Really?

122
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
So you bumped into Richard.You grabbed a "bite".

123
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
No big deal.

124
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
Great.

125
00:06:47 --> 00:06:51
Okay, London, 1.

126
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
Oh, look what happened.

127
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
Check me out.

128
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
I'm in my kitchen...

129
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
... naked.

130
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
I'm picking up an orange.

131
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
I'm naked.

132
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
I'm lighting the candles.

133
00:07:31 --> 00:07:35
Naked. And carefully.

134
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!

135
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
I am looking at this.

136
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
expressive brush strokes.

137
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
to be looking at that.

138
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
She knows I'm home.

139
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
She knows I can see her.

140
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
What kind of game is she playing?

141
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.

142
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
Dr. Geller.

143
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
Stop it. You're being silly.

144
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
Or am I?

145
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
Love to love you baby

146
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
Love to love you baby

147
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
Love to love you baby

148
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
Darn it!

149
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
May I come in?

150
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
Yeah, if you want to.

151
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
Do you want me to?

152
00:08:52 --> 00:08:53
Yeah, sure?

153
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
So do I.

154
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...

155
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
...I wanna lay down a coupleof ground rules.

156
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
This is just about tonight.

157
00:09:06 --> 00:09:11
I won't go through with thisif it'll raise the question of "us".

158
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
I just want this to be...

159
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
...about what it is.

160
00:09:20 --> 00:09:21
And...

161
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
...what is that, Ross?

162
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
The physical act of love.

163
00:09:26 --> 00:09:27
What, are you crazy?

164
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
So you weren't trying to entice mejust now with your nakedness?

165
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
Oh, God. You saw me?

166
00:09:38 --> 00:09:42
You weren't trying to entice mewith your nakedness?

167
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
You actually thoughtI wanted to have sex with you?

168
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
I'm sorry, but, Ross,you kicked off your shoes!

169
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
Can we just forget this ever happened?

170
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
Of course, you're right.I'm sorry.

171
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
Thank you.

172
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
I guess I'll go pack.

173
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
Wait, one more thing.

174
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
Do we still need to settlethe question of "us"?

175
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
Hey, you guys, wait!

176
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
You guys.

177
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
This place is much better than London.

178
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
A lady dressed like Cleopatragave me this.

179
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
Ninety-nine centsteak and lobster dinner.

180
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
You don't eat animals.

181
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.

182
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
I can totally settle down here.

183
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
It's got everything I could ever want.Including Joey! Look!

184
00:10:52 --> 00:10:53
Look! Hey!

185
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
Oh, my God.

186
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
Love your condoms, my man.

187
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
Why are you here?I told you not to come.

188
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?

189
00:11:07 --> 00:11:12
Because I'm shooting a scene right now.I play a gladiator.

190
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
Hold on a second. Can we cut?

191
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
My friends are here.I'm gonna take a break.

192
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
Who are you talking to?

193
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
The director.

194
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
Her.

195
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.I work here.

196
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
Why? What happened?

197
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
The movie shut down.Ran out of money.

198
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
I'm working here till it starts up,if it ever does.

199
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
- I'm so sorry.- Such a drag.

200
00:11:34 --> 00:11:35
Sorry I didn't tell you.I'm sorry.

201
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
Apparently there'sa new policy of not sharing.

202
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
- I knew you weren't okay with that.- So you're a gladiator!

203
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
What's going on?

204
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
Monica had lunch with Richard.

205
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
Dawson?

206
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
But that would've been so cool!

207
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
Her boyfriend Richard.

208
00:11:51 --> 00:11:55
It meant nothing. After all this time,how can you not trust me?

209
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
When you go lunching with hunky menand don't tell me!

210
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
You're right. I'm sorry.I should've told you.

211
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
Thanks.

212
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
- There we go.- Now I love Vegas.

213
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
I promise you next timeI absolutely will tell you.

214
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
"Next time"?

215
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
So close.

216
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
There won't be a next time.You cannot see him again.

217
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
I cannot see him?You can't tell me what to do.

218
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
That's funny, I think I just did.

219
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
If you act like this,I won't be around you.

220
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
- Fine.- Happy anniversary!

221
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
Guys, please! Come on, come on.

222
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
This is obviouslya misunderstanding.

223
00:12:31 --> 00:12:32
No, it is not.

224
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
Don't look at me.I just work here.

225
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
Okay, Ross? I'm a little warm,so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.

226
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
Now, I'm just letting you know...

227
00:12:45 --> 00:12:50
...this is not an invitationto the physical act of love.

228
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
Yep, that's hilarious.

229
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.

230
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
You know, last night wasembarrassing for you too.

231
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
No, not really. You've seen menaked hundreds of times.

232
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
But it was the firstfor the rest of my building.

233
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
That's true. But you know,I just don't embarrass that easily.

234
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
What? You totally get embarrassed.

235
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm justa more secure person than you are.

236
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
- Is that so?- Yeah.

237
00:13:15 --> 00:13:16
Hey, lady!

238
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
I don't care how muchyou want it, okay?

239
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
I am not gonna have sexwith you in the bathroom!

240
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
You know, in Roman times,this was more than just a hat.

241
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
Really?

242
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
Yeah, sure, sure.

243
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
They would scrub the floors.

244
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
They'd use it to get the mudoff their shoe.

245
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
Sometimes underneaththe horse would get dirty.

246
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
So they would stick it right...

247
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
I can't believe this is howI'm spending my anniversary.

248
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
I'll take you someplace nice.A guy tipped me $100.

249
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
He was playing blackjackfor an hour and he won $5000.

250
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49
Can you believe that?

251
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.

252
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
Build up my upper body...

253
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
...and hit Richard from behindwith a stick.

254
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
Wait! Why don't I justdo what that guy did?

255
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
I'll take this $100,turn it into $5000...

256
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
...and I'll turn that into enoughto get my movie going!

257
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
Good luck.

258
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
I don't need luck.I've thought this through.

259
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
I see.

260
00:14:15 --> 00:14:16
Thanks.

261
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
I can't believe this.This is like the worst night ever.

262
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
You had a minor setbackin your relationship.

263
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
Big deal.It's only Chandler.

264
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
I am so sorry.

265
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
This is crazy havingsuch a stupid argument.

266
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
I don't wanna see Richard.

267
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
So go fix it.

268
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
Find Chandler.He's probably in your room.

269
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
Tell him sorry and you love him.

270
00:14:39 --> 00:14:40
You're right, Phoebe.

271
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
- Thank you.- Sure.

272
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!

273
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
Anybody lose this?

274
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
Coming out.

275
00:14:56 --> 00:14:57
Place your bet.

276
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
Dice her out.

277
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
Yellow 11. Pay the front line!

278
00:15:09 --> 00:15:13
So I'm on my way back to the bathroom.

279
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
All right, all right.Just keep walking, all right?

280
00:15:25 --> 00:15:26
What are you...I am sorry, sir.

281
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
I think he just really likes you.

282
00:15:33 --> 00:15:38
You know that teacher who had a babywith her student?

283
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47
- Can I help you?- Yes.

284
00:15:47 --> 00:15:52
Do you have any extra pants? My friendseems to have had a little accident.

285
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
- Can I change $100?- Changing $100.

286
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
- Good luck, sir.- Thanks.

287
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
That's right.

288
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
- Thirteen.- Hit me!

289
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
Oh, man!

290
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
Wait!

291
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
You are not gonna believe this!

292
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
I have found my identical hand twin.

293
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
What?

294
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
My identical hand twin!

295
00:16:28 --> 00:16:29
What's an identical hand twin?

296
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
What does it sound like?

297
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
It's a guy with my identical hands.

298
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
It was incredible. The dealer's handswere exactly like mine.

299
00:16:36 --> 00:16:40
It was like lookingat my hands in a mirror!

300
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
You sure you weren'tlooking at your hands in a mirror?

301
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
Don't you see what this means?I can forget about that stupid movie.

302
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

303
00:16:49 --> 00:16:50
How?

304
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
I don't have it all worked out yet.

305
00:16:52 --> 00:16:56
But it's gotta mean big money.Come on, identical hands!

306
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
Again, I must go back to...

307
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
...how?

308
00:17:00 --> 00:17:05
This is Vegas, man.People will pay to see freaky stuff!

309
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
How much would you payto see this hand...

310
00:17:07 --> 00:17:10
...twice?

311
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
I can't really put a price on that.

312
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
Are you un-supporting me again?

313
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
I support you 100%.I just didn't get it right away.

314
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
Now I'm caught up.

315
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
Identical hand twins.

316
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
It's a million-dollar idea!

317
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
I found my identical hand twin!

318
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
Oh, you're so lucky!

319
00:17:37 --> 00:17:41
So where's Monica?Did you guys make up?

320
00:17:41 --> 00:17:42
But she just came up here.

321
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
That was Joey.

322
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
I wonder where she is?It's so weird.

323
00:17:46 --> 00:17:48
She's probably talking to Richard.

324
00:17:48 --> 00:17:49
Would you stop that?

325
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
You know what she saidafter her lunch with Richard?

326
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
She didn't feel anything for him.She loves you.

327
00:17:56 --> 00:17:57
- Really?- Yes.

328
00:17:57 --> 00:18:02
She feels terrible. She really wantsto make up. You've gotta find her.

329
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
Good.

330
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
I should really start wearing hats.

331
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
Welcome to Las Vegas.

332
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
- Did you enjoy your flight?- I did.

333
00:18:53 --> 00:18:56
Thank you very much.It was excellent.

334
00:18:56 --> 00:19:01
- I hope you had a nice flight.- Oh, it was the best.

335
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
I think the check-in is that way.

336
00:19:13 --> 00:19:16
Kids love me.

337
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
Hi, you guys are here!

338
00:19:18 --> 00:19:21
What'd you do?Did you go to a costume party?

339
00:19:21 --> 00:19:22
Let me guess.

340
00:19:22 --> 00:19:24
Pancho Villa.

341
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
And you're Bob Saget.

342
00:19:28 --> 00:19:30
Pancho Villa?

343
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
What are you talking about, Pheebs?I don't...

344
00:19:35 --> 00:19:37
Oh, my God! You drew on me?

345
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
Hey, you wet my pants!

346
00:19:40 --> 00:19:42
What kind of party was this?

347
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
I've been walking around like this?You have so crossed a line.

348
00:19:46 --> 00:19:49
Rach, wait.The men's room is that way.

349
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
It's the third time she's wonon a machine I was playing.

350
00:19:57 --> 00:19:59
I bet she's one of those people.

351
00:19:59 --> 00:20:01
Mole people?

352
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
What? No, a lurker.

353
00:20:03 --> 00:20:04
What's that?

354
00:20:04 --> 00:20:06
When you're playing a machineand it hasn't paid out...

355
00:20:06 --> 00:20:08
...a lurker waits for youto give up and then...

356
00:20:08 --> 00:20:10
Kills you?

357
00:20:11 --> 00:20:14
They swoop in and steal your jackpot.

358
00:20:15 --> 00:20:18
- How do you know about this?- My nana used to do it.

359
00:20:18 --> 00:20:20
That's how she paid for my dance...Karate lessons.

360
00:20:21 --> 00:20:22
Dance karate?

361
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
Yes, it's a deadly...

362
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
...but beautiful sport.

363
00:20:29 --> 00:20:30
- It won't come off.- What?

364
00:20:31 --> 00:20:31
It won't come off.

365
00:20:32 --> 00:20:33
Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?

366
00:20:34 --> 00:20:37
I took it offand then I drew it back on.

367
00:20:37 --> 00:20:39
You made it!

368
00:20:41 --> 00:20:43
Who's your friend?He's hot.

369
00:20:43 --> 00:20:44
Thanks, man.

370
00:20:44 --> 00:20:47
Listen, I talked to Chandler.And I'm sorry about the movie.

371
00:20:47 --> 00:20:48
Don't be sorry.

372
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
I don't need it anymore.I found my identical hand twin.

373
00:20:52 --> 00:20:52
Your what?

374
00:20:53 --> 00:20:55
My identical hand twin.The person whose hands are like mine.

375
00:20:56 --> 00:20:57
This is a gold mine.

376
00:20:57 --> 00:20:59
What?

377
00:20:59 --> 00:21:01
That won't make you any money.

378
00:21:01 --> 00:21:02
Well, fine.

379
00:21:02 --> 00:21:06
None of you will live with mein my hand-shaped mansion.

380
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
Except you.You can live in the thumb.

381
00:21:11 --> 00:21:13
All right, baby, come on!

382
00:21:13 --> 00:21:14
I am on fire!

383
00:21:15 --> 00:21:16
See you later.

384
00:21:16 --> 00:21:17
What are you doing?

385
00:21:17 --> 00:21:19
What's it look like?Going home.

386
00:21:19 --> 00:21:21
Why?

387
00:21:22 --> 00:21:23
Wait.

388
00:21:23 --> 00:21:25
Sorry, I was just playingfor one second.

389
00:21:25 --> 00:21:28
If you don't want me to seeRichard again, I won't.

390
00:21:28 --> 00:21:29
He means nothing to me.

391
00:21:30 --> 00:21:33
Oh, come on. I was there.

392
00:21:34 --> 00:21:36
I know he's the love of your life.

393
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
Not anymore.

394
00:21:38 --> 00:21:40
Really?

395
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
Really.

396
00:21:44 --> 00:21:45
All right?

397
00:21:45 --> 00:21:49
Let's forget about going homeand celebrate our anniversary.

398
00:21:50 --> 00:21:51
Okay, this is empty.

399
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
I wanted to make a dramatic scene,but I hate packing.

400
00:22:00 --> 00:22:01
Where's the other guy?

401
00:22:01 --> 00:22:02
Which guy?

402
00:22:02 --> 00:22:05
Tall, dark hair, hand looksexactly like this?

403
00:22:05 --> 00:22:09
I don't know about the hands,but he went to the restroom.

404
00:22:13 --> 00:22:15
How you doing?

405
00:22:15 --> 00:22:16
Very busy.

406
00:22:16 --> 00:22:19
Right. Okay.

407
00:22:21 --> 00:22:23
Yes, hello. I have a question.

408
00:22:24 --> 00:22:27
I used your pen to drawon my friend's face.

409
00:22:28 --> 00:22:30
A beard and a mustache.

410
00:22:31 --> 00:22:33
Thank you.

411
00:22:34 --> 00:22:36
No, she didn't think so.

412
00:22:36 --> 00:22:39
I know. It's like...Anyway...

413
00:22:39 --> 00:22:42
Makeup didn't cover it, we've triedeverything and nothing's worked.

414
00:22:42 --> 00:22:45
What do we do?

415
00:22:49 --> 00:22:51
Thank you.

416
00:22:51 --> 00:22:53
Yeah, it's not coming off.

417
00:22:53 --> 00:22:55
What? What else did he say?

418
00:22:55 --> 00:22:59
He said he thought I was funny.

419
00:22:59 --> 00:23:01
Okay, look.Let's just go downstairs...

420
00:23:02 --> 00:23:04
...we'll have some funand you will forget all about it.

421
00:23:04 --> 00:23:07
There's no way I am leavinglooking like this!

422
00:23:07 --> 00:23:09
Come on, Rach. It's not that bad.

423
00:23:09 --> 00:23:11
Ross, I am a human doodle!

424
00:23:12 --> 00:23:15
Just because some idiot drew on yourface doesn't mean you can't have fun.

425
00:23:15 --> 00:23:17
Besides, no one willeven look at you.

426
00:23:17 --> 00:23:21
This is Vegas. Hello?There are tons of other freaks here.

427
00:23:21 --> 00:23:26
There are tons of freaks here.No other. No.

428
00:23:26 --> 00:23:29
Come on. No one will notice. I swear.

429
00:23:34 --> 00:23:37
There was some staring and pointing.

430
00:23:37 --> 00:23:39
I need a drink.

431
00:23:39 --> 00:23:42
They really overcharge youfor that stuff.

432
00:23:43 --> 00:23:46
But who cares,because it's all on me.

433
00:23:49 --> 00:23:51
That is one big drink.

434
00:23:51 --> 00:23:53
Macadamia nut?

435
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
Wow! That's some pricey nut.

436
00:23:57 --> 00:23:59
Really like those macadamia nuts?

437
00:23:59 --> 00:24:01
Nope.

438
00:24:12 --> 00:24:13
Get out of here, you lurker!

439
00:24:14 --> 00:24:16
Go on, get!

440
00:24:17 --> 00:24:19
You made up.

441
00:24:19 --> 00:24:21
I couldn't be mad at himfor too long.

442
00:24:21 --> 00:24:24
She couldn't livewithout the "Chand love".

443
00:24:26 --> 00:24:27
Get a room.

444
00:24:28 --> 00:24:28
We have one.

445
00:24:28 --> 00:24:30
Use it.

446
00:24:35 --> 00:24:37
That's right.Take good care of those babies.

447
00:24:37 --> 00:24:38
Excuse me?

448
00:24:38 --> 00:24:39
It's me. Joey.

449
00:24:39 --> 00:24:41
Do I know you?

450
00:24:41 --> 00:24:44
Joey?

451
00:24:45 --> 00:24:47
Yeah, the hand guy.

452
00:24:47 --> 00:24:51
So what are we gonna doabout this hand twin thing?

453
00:24:51 --> 00:24:52
Nothing.

454
00:24:53 --> 00:24:55
Look, you and I have been given a gift.

455
00:24:55 --> 00:24:58
We have to do something with it.Like hand modeling. Or magic.

456
00:24:59 --> 00:25:02
And you know NASA'sgonna want to talk to us.

457
00:25:02 --> 00:25:04
I have to get back to work.

458
00:25:04 --> 00:25:05
We can have our own show.

459
00:25:05 --> 00:25:09
We can clap our hands together.People will love it!

460
00:25:10 --> 00:25:11
And I wrote a song for us.

461
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
This hand is your hand

462
00:25:14 --> 00:25:16
This hand is my hand

463
00:25:17 --> 00:25:20
Oh, wait, that's your hand

464
00:25:20 --> 00:25:23
No, wait, it's my hand

465
00:25:24 --> 00:25:25
That's okay.

466
00:25:25 --> 00:25:28
But you haven't even heard the chorus!

467
00:25:29 --> 00:25:30
Oh, my God.

468
00:25:30 --> 00:25:33
I look like my great-aunt Muriel.

469
00:25:33 --> 00:25:34
All right, you know what?

470
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
We don't have to go downstairs.

471
00:25:36 --> 00:25:38
We can bring Vegas up to us.

472
00:25:38 --> 00:25:39
All right, come on.

If you get this,we buy everybody a steak dinner.

488
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
Eight it is.

489
00:26:21 --> 00:26:22
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?

490

00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
Come on!

500
00:26:48 --> 00:26:50
I love you!I can't remember why we fought.

501
00:26:50 --> 00:26:51
Because I had lunch with Rich...

502
00:26:51 --> 00:26:53
Me neither!

503
00:26:53 --> 00:26:55
- What now?- Another hard eight.

504
00:26:55 --> 00:26:57
Hard eight?Let's call it easy eight!

505
00:26:57 --> 00:27:00
I'll tell you what.You roll another hard eight...

506
00:27:00 --> 00:27:03

507
00:27:06 --> 00:27:09
Shut up!

508
00:27:09 --> 00:27:12
It just got interesting!

509
00:27:16 --> 00:27:18
What did you say?

510
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
You roll another eight,we get married tonight.

511
00:27:21 --> 00:27:22

513
00:27:23 --> 00:27:26
I've never loved anybodyas much as I love you.

514
00:27:26 --> 00:27:28
I've never loved anybodyas much as I love you.

515
00:27:29 --> 00:27:32
So if an eight comes up,we take it as a sign and we do it.

516
00:27:32 --> 00:27:34

517
00:27:40 --> 00:27:40
That's a four.

00:27:43 --> 00:27:47
Nobody move!You look that way, I look this way.

521
00:27:50 --> 00:27:52
Here it is, here it is.

522
00:27:52 --> 00:27:55
That could be 4 or 5.

523
00:27:56 --> 00:27:58
It's your call.

524
00:28:00 --> 00:28:02
It's a four.

525
00:28:04 --> 00:28:06
I think so too.

526
00:28:27 --> 00:28:30
Oh, well, lost again.

553
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
Look, I need some help, okay?

554
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
Someone has to convincemy hand twin to cooperate.

555
00:29:56 --> 00:29:57
I'll do it.

556
00:29:57 --> 00:30:02

564
00:30:30 --> 00:30:32
No, something else.

578
00:31:33 --> 00:31:35
This lady played my quarter.This is my money.

Is that true, miss?

580
00:31:37 --> 00:31:40

00:31:41 --> 00:31:43
She sells drugs to kids.

582
00:31:43 --> 00:31:45
It was my quarter.

583
00:31:45 --> 00:31:46
Was it her quarter?

584
00:31:46 --> 00:31:49

585
00:31:49 --> 00:31:52
- Okay, lady, you're out of here.- No, you can't arrest me!

586
00:31:52 --> 00:31:55
I won't go back to that hellhole!

587

I'm just taking you outside.

588
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06

00:32:11 --> 00:32:12
- Let's go.- No, wait!

592
00:32:12 --> 00:32:13
We need something old.

593
00:32:13 --> 00:32:18
I have a condom in my walletthat I've had since I was twelve.

594
00:32:18 --> 00:32:19
That'll work.

595
00:32:19 --> 00:32:22
I don't think so.

596
00:32:22 --> 00:32:24
Now something borrowed.

00:32:24 --> 00:32:26
Here, just take this.

00:32:56 --> 00:32:59
Not yet, anyway.

604
