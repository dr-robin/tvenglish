1
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
Wow! That ripped!

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
That ripped real nice!

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
How many times do I have to tell you?You turn and slide.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
Turn and slide.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
You don't turn and slide.

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
You throw it out!

7
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
I get tetanus shotsevery time I get dressed!

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
We're not throwing it out.I built it with my own hands!

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
How about we sell it?

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
All right.

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
But you'll have to tell them.

12
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
Can we stick you in another cabinet?They seem all right with it!

13
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
The One with the Cat

14
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
It's Chip.

15
00:01:20 --> 00:01:21
Who's Chip?

16
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
into you today.

17
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
Give me a call.

18
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
"Chip" is Chip Matthews.

19
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
The guy who took Rachel to the prom?Why's he calling you?

20
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
Because I ran into him at the bank.He is still so cute.

21
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38
You're so lucky! He's likethe most popular guy in school!

22
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
I know!

23
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.

24
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
Oh, my God!We just had the best conversation!

25
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
I was just leaving.

26
00:02:00 --> 00:02:01
Good.

27
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
I've got a report to read.

28
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
It's eight pages.I hope I don't fall asleep.

29
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
Why? Did you write it?

30
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
Look at that!

31
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
Chip Matthews called.I wonder what he wants.

32
00:02:16 --> 00:02:17
Well, actually...

33
00:02:17 --> 00:02:22
I bet he sensed that I was readyto have sex with another guy.

34
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
Why don't you give him a call?

35
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
- Are you sure you want to hear this?- I'm sure.

36
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
Chip!Hi, it's Rachel.

37
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
Rachel Greene.

38
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
You left me a message?

39
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
Yes, you did.My roommate wrote it down.

40
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
Monica Geller?

41
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
Oh, that's right!

42
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
He called to ask out Monica.

43
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
That's got to be embarrassing.

44
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
Dumb drunken bitch

45
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
Thank you!

46
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
Here's a question.

47
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
Where'd you get the "finest oakeast of the Mississippi"?

48
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
First tell us where you gotthe prettiest lace in the land.

49
00:03:31 --> 00:03:31
It's your ad.

50
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
Looks good?

51
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
"Stunning entertainment center, fine...

52
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
Fine Italian craftsmanship."

53
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
You're sellingthe entertainment center?

54
00:03:43 --> 00:03:44
Why? I love it.

55
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
You want it?

56
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
Gepetto?

57
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
Five thousand dollars?

58
00:03:52 --> 00:03:53
Are you insane?

59
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
The ad alone cost $300.

60
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
I'm changing itto $50 or your best offer.

61
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
What kind of profit is that?And you call yourself an accountant?

62
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
What do you do?

63
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
I can't believe you don't know.

64
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
I actually don't know.

65
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
Oh, my God, no!Shoo, kitty!

66
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
Come on, you!

67
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
Crazy!

68
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
Oh, my God!

69
00:04:29 --> 00:04:30
Nothing.

70
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
What's wrong?

71
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
I just have this really strong feelingthat this cat is my mother.

72
00:04:39 --> 00:04:40
The mom you met in Montauk?

73
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
She was a cat?

74
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
No. She was a human lady.

75
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly.The one that killed herself.

76
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
Have you been taking your grandmother'sglaucoma medicine again?

77
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
No, Dr. Skeptismo.

78
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
I'm sure.First of all, there's the feeling.

79
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
And for another,she went into my guitar case...

80
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
...which is lined with orange felt.

81
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
My mother's favorite fishwas orange roughy.

82
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
Cats like fish.

83
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
Hi, Mommy!

84
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
I haven't seenthis smile in 17 years.

85
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
- Pheebs' mom's got a huge pair of...- Let it go!

86
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
When were you going to tell methat you're dating Chip?

87
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Now?

88
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
Can I go out with him?

89
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
No. I can't believe you'd want toafter what he did to me.

90
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
That thing at the prom?

91
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
I couldn't find him for hours!He was having sex with Amy Welsh!

92
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
That was in high school.How can it still bother you?

93
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
Why do you haveto go out with Chip?

94
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
We went to different schools.

95
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
We went to the same school.

96
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
You went to one where you were popular.

97
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
You rode on Chip's motorcycleand wore his letterman jacket.

98
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
I went to one where I wore a banduniform that was specially made.

99
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
They had that specially made?

100
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
It was a Home Ec project.

101
00:06:14 --> 00:06:18
Oh, my God! They saidit was for the mascot.

102
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
Back then I thought that I'd neverget to go out with a Chip Matthews.

103
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
Now he's called me upand asked me out.

104
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
The fat girl inside me reallywants to go. I owe her this.

105
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
I never let her eat.

106
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
- You go out with him.- Really?

107
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
If possible, could you leave himand have sex with another guy?

108
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
I'll try.

109
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
Any luck getting rid ofthe entertainment center?

110
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
There were a couple calls,but they won't work out.

111
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
Joey has a very carefulscreening process.

112
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
Not everyone is qualifiedto own wood and nails.

113
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
Stop it!

114
00:06:56 --> 00:07:01
She keeps trying to get away.Just like when she was alive.

115
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
How long is your momgoing to be with us?

116
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
I'm not sure.

117
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
I guess until she gets used tothe fact that there's...

118
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
...a new mom.

119
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
Now she's worriedthat she'll be replaced.

120
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
That's not going to happen, is it?

121
00:07:17 --> 00:07:18
I have to go make a call.

122
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
Why not use this phone?

123
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
I'm returning a call froma certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.

124
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
I just spelled the wrong word.

125
00:07:28 --> 00:07:33
So am I crazy, or does Pheebs' momremind anyone else of a cat?

126
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
Ross, don't start.

127
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
You actually believethere's a woman inside that cat?

128
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
I believe it.

129
00:07:42 --> 00:07:42
No, you don't.

130
00:07:43 --> 00:07:43
Yes, I do.

131
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
No, you...

132
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
You know what?

133
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
You won't suck me into this.

134
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
Sure I will.Because you always have to be right.

135
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
I do not always have...

136
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
"Jurassic Park" could happen.

137
00:08:09 --> 00:08:10
That's pretty nice.

138
00:08:11 --> 00:08:12
"Pretty nice"?

139
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
Pardon my roommate.He wanted to marry this.

140
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
We don't have $50.But would you trade for it?

141
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
We got a canoe.

142
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
I don't think we need a canoe.

143
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
You got to take it.

144
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
Just take the entertainment center.

145
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
Then when you get home,throw the canoe away.

146
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
We're not throwing it away.I built it.

147
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
Good for you!

148
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
You won't believewhat I found on a telephone pole.

149
00:08:48 --> 00:08:49
Look familiar?

150
00:08:49 --> 00:08:54
Apparently Pheebs' motheralso goes by the name "Julio".

151
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
A little girl's looking for this cat.Know what that means?

152
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
Yeah! $200 reward split five ways!

153
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
Do we have to tell her?

154
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
- Yes, we do.- But it's made her so happy.

155
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
Little girl misses her cat.

156
00:09:09 --> 00:09:13
Crazy lady thinksher mother is in a cat.

157
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
I have to go havedinner with my son.

158
00:09:15 --> 00:09:19
Can I trust that when you see Pheebs,you will tell her?

159
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
Thank you.

160
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
I hate when Ross is right.

161
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
He is right, isn't he?

162
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
This might be one timewhen he's wrong.

163
00:09:28 --> 00:09:28
You think?

164
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
He's right.

165
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
About your mom.

166
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
How's that going?

167
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
So great.We took a nap together today.

168
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
Mom fell asleepon my tummy and purred.

169
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
That's so sweet.

170
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
I'll go get some coffee.

171
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
What'd you say, Joe?I'll be right there.

172
00:10:06 --> 00:10:07
I just feel so...

173
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
- All right!- I'm coming already!

174
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
Not yet, not yet, not yet!

175
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
- Hello, Chip.- How you doing?

176
00:10:23 --> 00:10:24
I'm great!

177
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
Got a great job.I have wonderful friends.

178
00:10:27 --> 00:10:32
Though I'm not seeing anyone now,I've never felt better about myself.

179
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
So, Monica ready yet?

180
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
She'll be out in a second.

181
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
So, Chip, how's Amy Welsh?

182
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
Amy Welsh?I haven't seen her since...

183
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
So, Monica about ready?

184
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
This is the unit for you.

185
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Sturdy construction,tons of storage.

186
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
Some big enough to fit a grown man.

187
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
Yeah, I got in there myself once.

188
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
My roommate bet me $5 I couldn't.

189
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
Then he stuck a boardthrough the handles and locked me in.

190
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
It was funny till I feltlike it was a coffin.

191
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
No, you can't fit in there.It's not deep enough.

192
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
If I can't...

193
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
...I'll knock $5 off the price.

194
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
You have yourself a deal.

195
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
See?I told you.

196
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
Sometimes I come in herejust to get away from it.

197
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
Hey, a nickel!

198
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Here we are.

199
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
You still have the Chipper!

200
00:11:40 --> 00:11:41
The what?

201
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
That's what we calledyour motorcycle in high school.

202
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
A motorcycle's a chopper.

203
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
And you're Chip.

204
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
Never mind.

205
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
I think it's cute.

206
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
A lipper from Chipper.

207
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
Are you still in touch with anyone?

208
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
There's Rachel...

209
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
...and that's it.How about you?

210
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
I still hang with Simens and Zana.I see Spindler, Levine, Kelly.

211
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
I run into Goldie...

212
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...

213
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
...J.T., Beardsley.

214
00:12:15 --> 00:12:16
Is that all?

215
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
After high school,you kind of lose touch.

216
00:12:20 --> 00:12:21
I ran into Richard Dorfman.

217
00:12:21 --> 00:12:25
- How is he?- Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.

218
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
Isn't he an architect?

219
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
They still wear underwear.

220
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
Oh, my God!

221

224
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
Oh, man, he promisedhe wouldn't take the chairs!

225
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57

226
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
This guy came byto look at the unit...

227
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
...and he saidit won't fit a grown man.

228
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
So you got in voluntarily?

229
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
I was trying to make a sale!

230
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
If I ever run into him,you know what I'll do?

231
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
Bend over?

232
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
And then Zana just let one rip!

233
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Not that I don't enjoytalking about high school...

234
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
...because I do.

235
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
Maybe we can talkabout something else.

236
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
I don't know where you work.

237
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
- You know where I work.- I do?

238
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35

239
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
Still at the Multiplex?

240
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39

244
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46

245
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
Yeah, but I can stay outas late as I want.

246

253
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17

254
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
Tonight, I actually went outwith Chip in high school.

255
00:14:21 --> 00:14:22
Honey, I'm sorry.

256
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
Not only did I getto go out with Chip...

257
00:14:25 --> 00:14:26
...I got to dump Chip.

258
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
That's so great!

259
00:14:31 --> 00:14:32
What did the insurance company say?

260
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
They said, "You don't have insurance.Stop calling us."

261
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
You didn't tell her?

262
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
Okay, fine.

263
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
Listen...

264
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
...this cat belongs to a little girl.

265
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
There are flyers all over the place.

266
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
I'm sorry, sweetie.

267
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
We can take herback with you if you want.

268
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
But, you know, she chose to find me.

269
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
I have to respect her decision, right?

270
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
- That's a good call.- That's right.

271
00:15:12 --> 00:15:13
Enough is enough.

272
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
I'm sorry you feel guilty aboutspending time with your new mom.

273
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
But this isn't your old mom.

274
00:15:18 --> 00:15:19
This is a cat.

275
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
Julio the cat.

276
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
Not Mom! Cat.

277
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
Ross, how many parents have you lost?

278
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
None.

279
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
Then you don't know how it feelswhen one of them comes back.

280
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
I believe this is my mother.

281
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?

282
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
Just be a friend, okay?Be supportive.

283
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
I don't know what to say.

285
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
You could say...

286
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
...you're sorry to her mom.

287
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
I think she would like that.

288
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
Come here. Here, come here.

289
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
Mrs. Buffay?

290
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Sorry about what I said.

291
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
It was insensitive of me to say...

292
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
...that you were just a cat...

293
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
...when, clearly, you are also...

294
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
...the reincarnated spirit...

295
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
...of my friend's mother.

296
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
Thank you.

297
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
We both forgive you.

298
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
What will you do aboutthe little girl?

299
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
Listen.

300
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
Mom, I hope you knowyou still mean a lot to me.

301
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
You're welcometo come back anytime.

302
00:16:58 --> 00:17:02
If she'd come back as a couch,we'd really appreciate it.

303
00:17:03 --> 00:17:04
Come on.I'll take you home.

304
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
- I'll go with you.- Me too.

305
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
I got an extra futon.

306
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
Dude, you don't have to brag.We got nothing here.
