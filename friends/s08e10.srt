00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
- Hey.- Hey. So, what do you think?

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Boots? Boots!

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:16
They're a little more than I usuallyspend on boots or rent.

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
- Oh, my God.- I know.

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
- I'll miss being able to buy food.- They just looked so good.

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
The saleswoman was like:

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
- "These are too pricey for you."- She had a point.

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
- Hey.- Hi. Oh, my God.

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
- Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.- They're mine!

11
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
- Too bad we'll have to return them.- Return them? They're gonna hear you.

12
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
I'm not returning them.I'll wear them all the time.

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
I love the compliments.

14
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
Have you ever had somethingso beautiful, everyone wants it?

15
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53

00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
And I'm gonna play with youall the time.

21
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
How can you let him talkto your crotch like that?

22
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
- He's talking to the baby.- Oh! Okay.

23
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
When he said, "I can't waitfor your first words"...

24
00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
...I thought, "There's a trick."

25
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
I gotta go, you guys.I'll see you later.

26
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
- Okay. Bye.- Bye.

27
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
Can you do me a favor? My sisterknows you work at Ralph Lauren...

28
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
I am not sendingmore clothes to prison.

29
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
- It is a waste.- Not her.

30
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
My youngest sister Dinais interested in fashion.

31
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
She wants to talkto someone successful.

32
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
- I'll talk to my supervisor.- She wants to talk to you.

33
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.

34
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
- Would you meet with her?- Have her come by.

35
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
You'll love her. She's the smartestof all the Tribbiani children.

36
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
Yeah, you know the SATs?She took them.

37
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
- Doesn't Ben go to Smithfield School?- Yeah. Why?

38
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
- Sting's son goes there.- He's in Ben's class.

39
00:02:31 --> 00:02:36
You knew and said nothing? With allthe stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?

40
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.Can I talk about fossils?

41
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
"Sting's son, 7." There's a picture.

42
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
What are you reading, "The Kidnapper'sGuide to Manhattan Schools"?

43
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
It's an article aboutthe city's best schools.

44
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
- So how well do you know Sting?- I haven't met him.

45
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
That's too bad. I wanna go to hisconcert Friday, but it's sold out.

46
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
I know! Why don't youmeet him and get tickets.

47
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
If you get two, I'll take you.

48
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
Maybe he'll be there tomorrow.

49
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
There you go. You're so lucky.You might meet Sting tomorrow.

50
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
That's why you have kids.

51
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
- Hey, guys.- Hey.

52
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.

53
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
See? I'm getting a lot of useout of them already.

54
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
You can wear themwith dresses, skirts...

55
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
Wear them with shorts on the cornerand earn money to pay for them.

56
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
- Wow, they're beautiful.- They hurt so much.

57
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
- What?- The guy who made these...

58
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
...hates feetand wants to see them die.

59
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
Give them to me.I haven't felt my feet in years.

60
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
I can't. I told ChandlerI'd wear them all the time.

61
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
- Then return them.- I can't do that either.

62
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
The soles are scuffed up, and theinsides are filled with my blood.

63
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
Hey, I just picked up Benfrom school.

64
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
I don't think you dida very thorough job.

65
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
I dropped him off at Carol's.

66
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
Anyway, I'm not gonnaget those tickets.

67
00:04:12 --> 00:04:13
Oh, no. Why not?

68
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
It turns out Ben and Sting's sondo not get along.

69
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
- How come?- Sting's son made fun...

70
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
...of Ben's moms being "lesbenims."

71
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
If they don't get along, smooththings over. Make them be friends.

72
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
- You can't force kids to be friends.- Sure you can.

73
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
Give them some blocks.Put them in a playpen.

74
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
- Playpen? Ben's 7.- Your kid is 7?

75
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
He's really small.

76
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
- Please get the tickets.- I just can't do it.

77
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
- Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.- What?

78
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
Ross can

79
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
Look, I'm sorry...

80
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
Ross can

81
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
- Ross can get me the tickets

82
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
Ross can get me the tickets

83
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
Here she is: Future fashion superstar.

84
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
- Oh, Joey, I'm hardly...- My little sister Dina.

85
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.

86
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
- Thanks so much for meeting with me.- This is so exciting for her.

87
00:05:16 --> 00:05:21
Well, I'll let you two "fashists"get down to business.

88
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
Okay. All right, Dina.

89
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
Let's talk about the differentareas of fashion...

90
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
...you could get involved in.

91
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
There's design. But you mayneed another degree for that.

92
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
- Sales is great. You get to travel.- I don't care about fashion.

93
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
I'm pregnant. You are too.You gotta help me.

94
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
Then there's marketing.

95
00:06:00 --> 00:06:04
- What's wrong?- Nothing. I just was yawning.

96
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
Don't forgetmy office party's tonight.

97
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
We don't have to go, do we?

98
00:06:09 --> 00:06:14
I know that you don't like my parties,but you can wear your new boots.

99
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
See? Every cloud hasa supple leather lining.

100
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
- I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.- Why not?

101
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
Your bosses will thinkthey pay you too much money.

102
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
Or your assistant will see themand want a raise.

103
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
Do you think I workat a boot-pricing company?

104
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
I picked out this outfitthe boots don't go with.

105
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
You said those boots gowith skirts, dresses and pants.

106
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
Fine, I'll wear the boots.

107
00:06:40 --> 00:06:45
In fact, I'll go into my roomright now and try the outfit on.

108
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
Christmas party in my boots!

109
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.

110
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
It's gonna be okay.He's been incredibly supportive of me.

111
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
And if he gets upset,that's what the meatball sub is for.

112
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
- Thank you.- Okay.

113
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
Hey! It's my fashion girls.

114
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
- What's wrong?- Why don't you sit down?

115
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
Dina has somethingshe wants to tell you.

116
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
What's going on?Is it Mom? Is she sick?

117
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
Is it Dad's heart?

118
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
Is that a sandwich?

119
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
- Mom and Dad are fine.- Is that a sandwich?!

120
00:07:29 --> 00:07:34
Joey, there's somethingthat you should know. Dina?

121
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
- I'm pregnant.- What?

122
00:07:38 --> 00:07:39
Now. Give him the sandwich!

123
00:07:40 --> 00:07:44
Obviously, this is a mistake.You can't be pregnant.

124
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
You have to have sex to get pregnant.

125
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
Joe, I tried to wait untilI was 25, like you did.

126
00:07:50 --> 00:07:51
What? Dina...

127
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
I can't believe this. You'rethe good one who went to college!

128
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
- Both years! Who did this to you?- Bobby Corso. He's a real nice guy.

129
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
- I like him a lot. He's real funny.- You got pregnant for "funny"?

130
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
Dina, if he's funny, laugh!

131
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
- I'll be back in a while. Stay here!- Why?

132
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
I can't look at you right now.

133
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
- Wow.- I know.

134
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
- Oh, there you are, Ben.- Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?

135
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
I heard you have a problemwith one of the boys.

136
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
I thought I'd sit you both downand make it all okay.

137
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.

138
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.

139
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
Sometimes people may seemlike jerks on the outside...

140
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
...but they have famous fathers.

141
00:08:57 --> 00:09:02
- My friend Doug is waiting for me.- Him, you're friends with.

142
00:09:06 --> 00:09:11
- Can I help you with something?- Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.

143
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
- Are you with a student?- I'm with Ben.

144
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
- Are you one of Ben's mothers?- I am one of Ben's mothers.

145
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
I'm a lesbian.

146
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
It was difficult coming outto my parents.

147
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.I'm a new teacher here.

148
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
- I've only met your partner, Carol.- That would make me Susan.

149
00:09:30 --> 00:09:35
Are you looking for Jack's parentsto discuss his problems with Ben?

150
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
I think the parentsshould sit down together.

151
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
Yeah, let's do that!

152
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
That sounds good.

153
00:09:42 --> 00:09:46
We should sit down and talk.Me, Carol and the Stings.

154
00:09:46 --> 00:09:51
- How will I get in touch with them?- Their number's on the contact sheet.

155
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
Could I get a copy of that?Carol threw it out. She lost ours.

156
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
She's such a scatterbrain.But, man, what a hot piece of ass.

157
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
- That party wasn't bad.- I didn't know there'd be dancing.

158
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
That was a fun surprise.

159
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
- I don't see a cab. We should walk.- No, we can't walk.

160
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
It's 15 blocks to the subway.Let's go.

161
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
Do you think we can get to the subwayif we climb through that manhole?

162
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
- What's going on?- I can't walk, okay?

163
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
- These boots were a huge mistake.- What?

164
00:10:25 --> 00:10:29
You were right. I never should'vebought them. They're killing me.

165
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
So I was right. This is whatit feels like to be right.

166
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
It's oddly unsettling.

167
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
How will we get home?A piggyback ride?

168
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
- Hop on.- Okay, wait.

169
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
Let me just get my boots off first.

170
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
Oh, God.

171
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56
I know you're in pain right now,but I'm a little turned on.

172
00:10:59 --> 00:11:03
Do you worry that you'll be walkingand your baby will slip out?

173
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
What college was that, Dina?

174
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
Oh, my God. Bobby?

175
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

176
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
- Joey, what are you doing?- Just what needs to be done.

177
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
- Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...- This is crazy.

178
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
Don't interrupt mewhen I'm talking to God!

179
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
- Where were we? Do you take this man...- No!

180
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
- You'll take him.- I won't!

181
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
- You don't get a say.- I do.

182
00:11:30 --> 00:11:34
- I heard "I do." We're halfway there.- All right, Joey, that is enough!

183
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
As moving as this is,this is not legal.

184
00:11:37 --> 00:11:42
They don't have a marriage license orwitnesses, and the groom has one shoe.

185
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
Yeah, he took the other one offand hit me with it.

186
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
What am I to do?

187
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
They are adults and can maketheir own decisions.

188
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
No, they can't. They werestupid enough to get knocked up!

189
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
Contraceptives are notalways effective. Right?

190
00:11:59 --> 00:12:04
- Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.- Come on, kids, a little help here!

191
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
Wow! This place is incredible!

192
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
Sting's pen...

193
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
...that he gave to Phoebe.

194
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
Come on, secret passageway.

195
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
- Hi.- Hi.

196
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.

197
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
- Why else would I be here?- Why don't you sit down?

198
00:12:32 --> 00:12:37
They haven't been getting along.I'm sure there are two sides to this.

199
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
But all I've heardis that Ben's a "poo-poo-head."

200
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
Won't Jack's father be joining us?

201
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
I'm sorry.Jack's father's not available.

202
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
Then, could we reschedulefor Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?

203
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
Oh, no, my husband's in concert.

204
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
Concert. Yeah.That just put us in quite a pickle.

205
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
I'm busy before and afterthe concert, and he's busy during.

206
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
So you and I should talk aboutJack and Ben right now.

207
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
Unless... Unless...

208
00:13:06 --> 00:13:09
Okay, I would be willingto go to the concert...

209
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
...all the while thinkingabout the children.

210
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
- Are you here for tickets?- Thank you. Four would be great.

211
00:13:16 --> 00:13:20
I'm not giving tickets to someonewho'd use their son like this.

212
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.

213
00:13:23 --> 00:13:26
I've pressed a buttontriggering an alarm.

214
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
- Any minute the police will be here.- The Police? Here?

215
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
A reunion?

216
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.

217
00:13:40 --> 00:13:45
- Oh, wait! Stop, stop, stop!- Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?

218
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
My boots in tan!Can I see the price?

219
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
I can see it from right here.It'll cost you one husband.

220
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
I can walk the rest of the way now.Just give me my boots.

221
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
- I don't have your boots.- Where are they?

222
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
Why don't you check in oneof my saddlebags while I chew on hay?

223
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
Okay. My God, we gotta go backand get them!

224
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
Are you ever gonnawear the boots again?

225
00:14:10 --> 00:14:15
I'll never wear them again. I justdidn't get a chance to say goodbye.

226
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
You can say goodbye to the tan ones.

227
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
- Okay. All right.- Okay.

228
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!

229
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
Just because they're not gettingmarried doesn't mean it's a disaster.

230
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
- Maybe they have a plan.- Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.

231
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
What's the future look likefor Dina and Bobby?

232
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
I really have high hopes for my band.

233
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
- You were right. He is funny.- Now wait a minute.

234
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
I bet when you told people you wantedto be an actor they laughed.

235
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
Tell us a bit about your band.

236
00:14:51 --> 00:14:56
It's just me and my pal Rooster.The band's name is Numbnuts.

237
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
Really?

238
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
If you're having a baby,you should be married.

239
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
Even if it is to Bobby.Dude, that's not a compliment.

240
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
- I knew you wouldn't be supportive.- What are you gonna do?

241
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
Have the baby and raise itwithout a husband?

242
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
You can't be a single mother!You'll ruin your life!

243
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
- Am I ruining my life?- No, it's different for you.

244
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
You're not some kidwho doesn't know what she's doing.

245
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
- Excuse me?- One pregnant woman at a time, please!

246
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
- I just want you to be okay.- By forcing her to marry?

247
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
Maybe.

248
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
Yeah. So, what kind of musicdoes Numbnuts...

249
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
Ah, forget it! I can't!

250
00:15:42 --> 00:15:47
I am scared to death about this. But Ican do it. I just need some help.

251
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
- Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.- You bet.

252
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
To answer your earlier question,we're straight up gangster rap.

253
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
Rachel's told me how easyyou've made this on her.

254
00:16:00 --> 00:16:05
- Why can't you do that for me?- Because you're my baby sister!

255
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
And you're my big brother,my favorite guy in the whole world.

256
00:16:09 --> 00:16:14
I'm not even scared to tell Momand Dad. I was scared of telling you.

257
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
I'd be scared of them, but all right.

258
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
I can't stand having this babywith you mad at me.

259
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
I want him to have his uncle.

260
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?

261
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
Of course he's gonna havehis Uncle Joey.

262
00:16:30 --> 00:16:35
We'll be all right. Even if we're notmarried, this baby will be so loved.

263
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
- And not just by us.- That's right.

264
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
By his uncle too.

265
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
And by you.

266
00:16:45 --> 00:16:49
Bobby, come over here and let themhave a little moment, okay?

267
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
Come here.

268
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?

269
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
You're gonna love me so much.I got Sting tickets!

270
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
Oh, my God, I do love you!How did you do it?

271
00:17:08 --> 00:17:09
Well, let's just say:

272
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
Ross can

273
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
- Where are the seats?- Balcony.

274
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
Is that more than 50 yards away...

275
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
...from Sting, his wifeor a member of his family?

276
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
- Yeah.- Then that's not breaking the law!

277
00:17:27 --> 00:17:28
