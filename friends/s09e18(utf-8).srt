1
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Monica?Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
- Okay.- All right!

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:11
But what is it not?

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
A place to entertain my lady friends.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
- And what else is it not?- A place to eat spaghetti.

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
Very good. What do you needit for anyway?

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
The Powerball lotteryis up to 300 million...

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
...and they don't sell tickets here.- So you're driving up to Connecticut?

9
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
Yeah, Connecticut.Not West Virginia.

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
Maybe I'll drive you up there.I'd like to buy some tickets myself.

11
00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid,we could really use $300 million.

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
Yes, because if I was at my old job,we'd say, "300 million? No, thank you."

13
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
- Will you get me tickets too?- Yeah, me too.

14
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
- Sure.- I have an idea.

15
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks,we'll pool our money together...

16
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
...and then if we win, we'll split it.- That's a great idea!

17
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
No, thanks.

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
- You don't want to win the lottery?- Sure I do.

19
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
I also want to be kingof my own country...

20
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
...and find out what happenedto Amelia Earhart.

21
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
- Still on Amelia Earhart?- The woman just vanished!

22
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
Seriously, you don't want in on this?

23
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
No. Do you know what your oddsare of winning the lottery?

24
00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
I mean, you have a better chanceof being struck by lightning 42 times.

25
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
But there's six of us, so we'donly have to get struck 7 times.

26
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
I like those odds!

27
00:01:17 --> 00:01:20
Seriously, you guys, I can't believeyou're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.

28
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
I mean, that's such a bunchof boo-hockey.

29
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
I'll ask.

30
00:01:27 --> 00:01:28
"Boo-hockey"?

31
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
Oh, we think Emma's aboutto start talking...

32
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
...so we're trying to be careful aboutwhat words we use in front of her.

33
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
So get ready to hear a lotof boo-hockey...

34
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
...gosh darn itand brother pucker.

35
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
How do you knowshe's gonna start talking?

36
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
When I talk to her, I almost feellike she understands what I'm saying.

37
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
Kind of like Joey.

38
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
What's that now?

42
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
God, look at all these tickets.It's so exciting.

43
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
I haven't won anythingsince sixth grade.

44
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
Pie-eating contest?

45
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
You assume because I was heavy that'sthe only way I could win something?

46
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
No, I saw a pictureof you covered in blueberries.

47
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
- That was a good day.- Yeah.

48
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
- They're towing your car!- I'm parked in a garage on Morton.

49
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
They're towing a car.

50
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
And I am seeing spots.

51
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Ross, you don't have Emma!Rachel, you don't have Emma!

52
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
- Where's Emma? Who has Emma?- Joey, relax.

53
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
My mother picked her up two hours ago.You were there.

54
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
- I was?- Yes, and you talked to her.

55
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
- I did?- She dropped off a casserole.

56
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.

57
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
Did you come by to watchus win the big bucks?

58
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
Yeah. And then I figured after you win,we can all go out to the balcony...

59
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
...and see a night rainbowwith gremlins dancing on top of it.

60
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
Don't touch the phone!I'll get it!

61
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
- You think he washed his hands?- Hello?

62
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
- Hey, Charlie, what do you know?- What's going on?

63
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
Chandler's supposed to find out if he'sgetting a job at his agency.

64
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
But out of 15 interns,they're only hiring three.

65
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
- Tough odds.- Yeah.

66
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
If only it were a sure thinglike your 24-state lottery.

67
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
Yeah, look who's coming around!

68
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
Damn it. All right, call mewhen you know more.

69
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
- Did you get it?- One of the slots got filled.

70
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
- By you?- Sense the tone.

71
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
- No, that kid Nate got it.- Oh, I hate that guy.

72
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
I mean, come on, kid,pull up your pants!

73
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
Well, there's two spots left, right?

74
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Yeah. I mean, I want this so much.I want to get one.

75
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
I want my friend Charlieto get one.

76
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
Except I don't care about Charlie.

77
00:04:08 --> 00:04:09
- Hey, you guys.- Hey!

78
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
You are not gonna believe this.I just saw my psychic...

79
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
...and she said I was definitelygonna win the lottery tonight!

80
00:04:16 --> 00:04:17
I thought we could usesome extra luck...

81
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
...so I brought a wishbone homefrom work.

82
00:04:19 --> 00:04:24
A psychic and a wishbone?Guys, give someone else a chance.

83
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
- All right, who wants to do it?- Can I?

84
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
Vegetarians never getto do the wishbone.

85
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
It's really not fair. Just becausewe don't eat the meat...

86
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
...doesn't mean we don't liketo play with the carcasses.

87
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
All right. Rach?

88
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
I don't want that turkey smellall over my hands.

89
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
I'll do it! Lt'll get the casserolestink off of mine.

90
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
- I hope I win.- Well, it doesn't really matter.

91
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
You're both wishingfor the same thing.

92
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for,or else, you know, it won't come true.

93
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
Right. But we knowwhat you're wishing for.

94
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
- I can't really say.- I understand.

95
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
But you're wishingfor what we think, aren't you?

96
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
I'm not really comfortablewith these questions!

97
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
- Please!- Just do it!

98
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
Okay. One, two, three.

99
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
I won! Hey!

100
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
You know what? I'm sure yourwish is gonna come true.

101
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
But, you guys, just in case, maybe agenie will come out if we rub this lamp.

102
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
That thing gets hot!

103
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
Ross, just keep making your jokes.

104
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
How are you gonna feelif we actually do win?

105
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
- You're not gonna win.- I know the odds are against us...

106
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
...but somebody has to win, and it couldbe us. And then how you gonna feel?

107
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
We're gonna be like, "Everybody, let'stake our helicopters up to the Cape."

108
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
And you're gonna be all,like, "Oh, I can't, guys.

109
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
I'll have to meet you up there.I gotta gas up the Hyundai."

110
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
Okay, I've heard myself on tape,and I sound nothing like that.

111
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
I can see the headline now:"Lottery Winners' Friend...

112
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
...Filled With Regret,Eats Own Arm."

113
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
Why would I eat my own arm?

114
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
Well, you wouldn't, but we own thepaper. We can print whatever we want.

115
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
You know what? I'm gonnathrow in 50 bucks for you.

116
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
- Why?- Because I know that you think...

117
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
...that the lottery is boo-hockey...

118
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
...but we're all here, and we're gonnawatch the numbers and have fun.

119
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
And you're my brother,and I want you to be a part of this.

120
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
You don't have to do that.I mean, I'll pay for myself.

121
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
But just the fact that you want me tohave fun with you guys, that's so sweet.

122
00:06:09 --> 00:06:10
Come here.

123
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
Get a room.

124
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
So now that you're in,what are you gonna do if we win?

125
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
- I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.- Calm down.

126
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
Seriously, that's your fantasy?To invest it?

127
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, "invest it"?I meant, "Be cool and piss it all away."

128
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
I know! We should pool allour money and buy the Knicks!

129
00:06:33 --> 00:06:34
I don't really care about the Knicks.

130
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
You will when I pick youas starting forward.

131
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
You would do that?I never get picked!

132
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
I'm not sure a sports teamis the way to go.

133
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
You won't let me buy the Knicks?I can't believe you're taking this away.

134
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
You're right, it has been your dreamfor over 15 seconds.

135
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
How long until they announcethe numbers, Mommy?

136
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
I'll take this one too."Mommy"?

137
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
Oh, I've gotten into the habitof calling Rachel...

138
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
..."Mommy" when we're around Emma.

139
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
Which I now realize we are not.

140
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough,it'll be her first word.

141
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
Although if we're gonna do that,we should probably call me "Daddy" too.

142
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
I like that, Daddy.

143
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
I was just talking about Rachel.

144
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
Is Daddy getting angry?

145
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
Is Daddy gonna spank me?

146
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Well, that depends.

147
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
Have you been a bad...?No, I can't.

148
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.Did anybody else hear?

149
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
What? Susan got it? How?

150
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Oh, man, I would've slept with him!

151
00:07:42 --> 00:07:43
All right, bye.

152
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
Dude, I'm sorry.But hey, there's one spot left, right?

153
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
- Well, Charlie's gonna get that.- Hey, don't say that.

154
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
You've got just as good a chanceof getting that job.

155
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
He is the boss' son.

156
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
- Come on, lottery!- Yeah!

157
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
- It starts in, like, 20 minutes.- Okay, here we go.

158
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
We need to sort through the ticketsquickly to see if we've won.

159
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
So does anybody have any ideashow to organize this?

160
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
Okay, how about this:

161
00:08:05 --> 00:08:06
We divide theminto six groups of 40.

162
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
The remaining 10 can be readby whoever finishes first.

163
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
- I have another idea.- I'm sorry, idea time is over.

164
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
- Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?- Yeah.

165
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
- What about the ones on the nightstand?- There are no tickets there.

166
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
Yes, there are.I just saw them a few minutes ago.

167
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
No, you didn't.You must be mistaken.

168
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
- There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.- Chandler, sense the tone.

169
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
Well, well, well.Look what Mommy found.

170
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
Okay, fine. I bought 20 extratickets for me and Chandler.

171
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
The psychic also said thatI would be betrayed.

172
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
I can't believe this.I thought we were all in this together.

173
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
- Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!- Three minutes ago!

174
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
I don't know why that's important.

175
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
I was with you the whole time.When did you even get those?

176
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
When you were reading the dirtymagazines without taking off the plastic.

177
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
I'll show you how.

178
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Okay. Well, Monica, suppose oneof your special tickets wins?

179
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
How are you gonna feel when you winand lose your friends?

180
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
Please. If I win the lottery,you guys are not gonna leave me.

181
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
Someone gave me muffins last week, andI couldn't get rid of you for three days!

182
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
Chandler, would you just tell herwhat she did was wrong?

183
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
She's right. You shouldn't havebought tickets just for us.

184
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
Let me finish.

185
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
However, it doesn't look likeI'm gonna get this job...

186
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
...so I can't afford to have principles.So screw you! The tickets are ours!

187
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
There's the man I married.

188
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
All right. Believe me,if you win the lottery...

189
00:09:26 --> 00:09:27
...it's the last you're gonna hearfrom us.

190
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
Fine. Don't be my friends.I'll buy new friends.

191
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plasticsurgery so they look just like you!

192
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
You know what?I want my share of the tickets.

193
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
I want my tickets too!And I'm buying the Knicks!

194
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
And Steffi Graf!

195
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
Cool. Then I want mine too!And if I win...

196
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
...I'm gonna put it allinto a very low-yield bond!

197
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
No. You guys, we gotta keepall the tickets together.

198
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
No. No, we should divide them up...

199
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
...and I should get extra becausewe used my car!

200
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,it should be me!

201
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
- This whole thing was my idea!- Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!

202
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
Just give them to me,and I'll split them up!

203
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
Hey, hey!

204
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
God, I can't take it anymore!I'm putting an end to this!

205
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
- Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!- Wait, no, no! Hey!

206
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
If we're not doing this together,we're not doing it at all.

207
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
- Say goodbye to your tickets.- No! No! No!

208
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
Do not come any closer!

209
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
Can I come a little bit closer?Valuable things are getting squished.

210
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
Now, what's more important,your friends or money?

211
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
- Friends!- Money!

212
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
Friends.

213
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
Hey, Monica,what about your extra tickets?

214
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
They're all in there.

215
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
- Even these five that I hid in my bra.- Monica!

216
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.

217
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
There is no way I wasgonna dump this...

218
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
God! No!

219
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
I think I broke your bowl.

220
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Go! Go! Go!

221
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
What a beautiful night to be runningaround the street, looking for tickets.

222
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
And the wind sure made it fun.

223
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
- Phoebe, we lost half of them.- So what?

224
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
Monica, we have the winning ticket.

225
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
My psychic said I wasgonna win, remember?

226
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
Weird your psychic didn't mentionanything about the scary pigeon.

227
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
As a matter of fact, she saidthat's how I'm going to die.

228
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
So excuse mefor being a little skittish.

229
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
There's two messages.This could be from work.

230
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
- Oh, play them.- Okay. Here we go.

231
00:11:34 --> 00:11:39
the balcony calling to apologize.

232
00:11:39 --> 00:11:43
out of the pretty lady's hand.

233
00:11:44 --> 00:11:48
Not hers. Bye.

234
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
Well, I bet that was very hardfor him to do.

235
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
"Hey", "Chandler", "it's Charlie."

236
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
This is it.

237
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
out I got the last spot.

238
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
It was a lot of fun working with you.

239
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
Give me a call if you want.

240
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.

241
00:12:10 --> 00:12:11
Sorry, Chandler.

242
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
It is so unfair. It's like that time theypromoted Saundra over me at work.

243
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
Was she related to Ralph Lauren?

244
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
No, she was just much betterat her job than me.

245
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
You guys, the drawing'sabout to start.

246
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
We should call my mom'sand say good night to Emma...

247
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
...before she goes down.- Good idea.

248
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
Honey, you're being really strongabout this.

249
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
I know how badly you wanted that job.

250
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
Yeah, you know, I reallythought I deserved it.

251
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
But let's go win the lottery. I mean, westill have a 130 chances to win, right?

252
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
Hundred and thirty-one.

253
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
Yeah, good night, sweetheart.I love you.

254
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
And remember,you're Daddy's little girl.

255
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.

256
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.

257
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
Rach, they're announcingthe numbers!

258
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
My God, I can already feelmyself changing.

259
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
numbers. We have 53.

260
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
- I've got that.- We have one too!

261
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
We are on the road, people!

262
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
Come on!

263
00:13:08 --> 00:13:13
Mom, please, I know you love your newlips, but I can barely understand you.

264
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
Would you please just let mesay good night to my daughter?

265
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
The Powerball is seven.

266
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
All right, check your numbers!Make me rich.

267
00:13:22 --> 00:13:23
You guys,you're not gonna believe this.

268
00:13:23 --> 00:13:26
I was just saying good nightto Emma, and she said her first words.

269
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
- What?- Well, what did she say?

270
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
She said, "Gleba"!

271
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
Make me rich!

272
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
- Isn't that amazing?- Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.

273
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
Why aren't you more excited?

274
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
Rach, gleba is not a word.

275
00:13:44 --> 00:13:47
- Well, of course it is.- Okay. What does it mean?

276
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
Well, I don't know all the words.

277
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
You know, I'm just glad I didn'tmiss my daughter's first word.

278
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
- Yes you did! Gleba is a word!- Okay. Use it in a sentence.

279
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
Okay. Emma just said, "Gleba."

280
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
- It's not a word.- Okay, fine. I'm gonna look it up.

281
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
Okay, great.

282
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
While you're at it,she said another word the other day.

283
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
Why don't you look up:

284
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba.Gleba. Gleba. Gleba!

285
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
Here it is! "The fleshy, spore-bearinginner mass of a certain fungi."

286
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
She's gonna be a scientist.

287
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
- Damn it. Anybody got anything?- No.

288
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
I'm still looking through mine.

289
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
Just double-checking.No.

290
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
No. No.

291
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
No!

292
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
Hello? Hold on.

293
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
It's your boss.

294
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
The "I'm sorry I rejected you"phone call.

295
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
I'm not used to getting thesefrom guys.

296
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
- Hey, Steve.- Chandler, hi.

297
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
I'm sure you've heardwe filled the three positions.

298
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
We felt that with yourmaturity and experience...

299
00:15:07 --> 00:15:09
...you wouldn't be happybeing someone's assistant.

300
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
I'd love to be somebody'sassistant. Answering phones...

301
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
...getting coffee,I live for that stuff.

302
00:15:13 --> 00:15:17
And I'm not too mature.Farts, boobies, butt cracks!

303
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
Chandler, you were the strongestperson in the program.

304
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
We're offering you the positionof junior copywriter.

305
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
Me? That guywho just said, "butt cracks"?

306
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
"Yes", "that's right."

307
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
We're excited about the levelof sophistication...

308
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33

00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
Thanks. Does that meanI get the good loving tonight?

314
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
You bet. No TV or anything.

315
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
- Hey, that is so great about the job.- Thanks, man.

316
00:16:03 --> 00:16:04
I'd like to think I hadsomething to do with it.

317
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
- Really? Why?- Well, before with the wishbone.

318
00:16:07 --> 00:16:12
I didn't wish we would win the lottery.I wished you'd get the job.

319
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
Oh, yeah?

320
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
Listen, don't tell Monica.She'll rip your heart right out.

321
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Well, you know what?There was a little part of me...

322
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
...that really thoughtwe were gonna win.

323
00:16:23 --> 00:16:28
Me too. So much for mydinosaur/ Amelia Earhart theme park.

324
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
You guys? What was the Powerballnumber again?

325
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
- Seven.- We won.

326
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
- What?- We won!

327
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
- Let me see! Let me see!- Don't tear it!

328
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
Phoebe, you don't have anyof the first five numbers!

329
00:16:42 --> 00:16:47
I know that, but look, we gotthe Powerball number. We won $3!

330
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
Wow, you think we should get that over20 years or go for the big payout?

331
00:16:51 --> 00:16:55
I don't care. I've never wonanything before. I can't believe this!

332
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna dowith your $3?

333
00:16:57 --> 00:17:01
Well, it's not all mine.We all get 50 cents.

334
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
You know what?You can have mine.

335
00:17:03 --> 00:17:04
- Me too.- Me too.

336
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
Me too.

337
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
Well, I guess if everybody else is.

338
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
Hey, guys. So I just calledthe Powerball hot line.

339
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
- Can you believe it? Nobody won.- I beg to differ.

340
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
Maybe nobody won the jackpot,but there was this guy in here earlier...

341
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
...and he found a ticket on the streetright outside and won $ 10,000.

342
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
Again, don't blame the pretty lady.

343
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
It was not her fault.It was me, the pigeon.

344
00:17:53 --> 00:17:56
Seriously, stop staring at her.

345
00:18:06 --> 00:18:07
