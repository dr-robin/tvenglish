1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
We are so in luck!

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
Treeger said we could haveall this cool stuff!

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
Wait right there.

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
Oh, no. I'm paddling away.

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
Really? We got all thisrusty crap for free?

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:22
This and a bunch of bubble wrap.And some of it is not even popped.

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Could we be more white trash?

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
The One with the 'Cuffs

9
00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
How desperate am I?

10
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
Good thing Chandler's not here.He always wins at this game.

11
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
I just told my momI'd cater her party.

12
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
How come?

13
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
I need the money.

14
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
It'd be a great way to get rid ofthat last smidgen of self-respect.

15
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
I think this is a good thing.

16
00:01:24 --> 00:01:27
Mom wouldn't have hired youif you weren't good.

17
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
You don't have to stick up for her.She can't hear you.

18
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33
Do you have any juice?

19
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
Just pickle.

20
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
Funny story.I bumped into Joanna yesterday.

21
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
My boss, Joanna?That must have been awkward.

22
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
Actually, she asked meif I wanted a drink.

23
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
You didn't say yes to that,did you?

24
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
Hello, Rachel.

25
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
Well, not at first.

26
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
What is she doing here?

27
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
Last time you went out with heryou said she was a dud!

28
00:02:06 --> 00:02:12
I judged her too quickly.This time, we took it to the next level.

29
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
Last time I almost got fired.You must end it. You must end it now.

30
00:02:17 --> 00:02:18
It's not an everyday occurrence!

31
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
Usually I'm in there by myself.

32
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
Promise me you will end it.

33
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
- I promise. I'll end it.- Thank you.

34
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
I hope you know what I'm giving up.

35
00:02:33 --> 00:02:38
She's not just the boss in your office.You know what I mean?

36
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
Sorry.I knew what he meant.

37
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
How's the hired help?

38
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
Doing great.Quiches are coming along.

39
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
What's this?Blue nail polish?

40
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
I thought it was cute.

41
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
It's what your grandmother's handslooked like when we found her.

42
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Let me ask you a question.

43
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
Why did you hire me?

44
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
Richard raved aboutthe food at his party...

45
00:03:05 --> 00:03:06
...but you were sleeping with him.

46
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
Then I heard the food at thatlesbian wedding was nice.

47
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
I assume you didn't sleepwith anyone there.

48
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
At least that would be something.

49
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
Oh, my God!Did you hear that?

50
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
She hired me becauseshe thinks I'm good.

51
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
I didn't hear that.

52
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
She didn't hire me out of pity.

53
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
It wasn't so she could pick on me.She actually thinks I'm good.

54
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
And hey, it's coolif you're a lesbian.

55
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
Good afternoon. Are youthe decision-maker of the house?

56
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
Do you currently owna set of encyclopedias?

57
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
No, but try the classifieds.People sell everything in there.

58
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
Actually, I'm not buying.I'm selling.

59
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Let me ask you one question.

60
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
Do your friends ever havea conversation...

61
00:04:04 --> 00:04:09
...and you just nod along,not sure what they're talking about?

62
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
I'm telling you,it's totally unconstitutional.

63
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.

64
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
It was like theAlgonquin kids' table.

65
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

66
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
You haven't said anythingfor about two minutes.

67
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Are you at all interested?

68
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
Come on in.

69
00:04:38 --> 00:04:39
- That's weird.- What?

70
00:04:40 --> 00:04:40
Your nails.

71
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
I wore fake ones so my mom wouldn'tgive me grief about biting them.

72
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
I meant, it's weird thatyou only have nine now.

73
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
Oh, my God!

74
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
Wait a minute.

75
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
I had them when I put...

76
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
Oh, my God!It's in the quiche!

77
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
- Oh, my God!- Okay, don't panic.

78
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
I'll go buy you a new set of nails.

79
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
No one will know,and you'll look great!

80
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
It's because they're going to eat...That's the problem.

81
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
Honey, don't bite your nails.

82
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Please don't freak out.

83
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
There's a blue fingernailin one of the quiche cups.

84
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
And there's no way to know which one.

85
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
And whoever finds it wins the prize!

86
00:05:25 --> 00:05:26
I'm not freaking out.

87
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
- Why are you laughing?- Now your father owes me $5.

88
00:05:30 --> 00:05:31
You bet I'd lose a nail?

89
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
Don't be silly.I just bet that I'd need these.

90
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Frozen lasagnas?

91
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
You bet that I'd screw up?

92
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
All that stuff about how I was good...

93
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
No, that was all true.

94
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
This was just in caseyou "pulled a Monica".

95
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
You promised Dr. Weinbergyou'd never use that phrase.

96
00:05:48 --> 00:05:49
Come on.Have a sense of humor.

97
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
You're never able tolaugh at yourself.

98
00:05:52 --> 00:05:53
That's right.

99
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
My mom has no faith in me!That's hilarious!

100
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
I don't get it.

101
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
No. I have faith.

102
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
No. You have lasagnas!

103
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
The ruined quiches are ready!

104
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
It just doesn't feel likewe're breaking up.

105
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
No, we are.I'm sad.

106
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
Can you wait till tomorrow?All right.

107
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Unbelievable!

108
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
Thanks.

109
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
That was my boss.I have to go.

110
00:06:40 --> 00:06:41
What are you doing?

111
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
- I'm getting dressed.- Why?

112
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
When I walk outside naked,people throw garbage.

113
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
Wait.I want to show you something.

114
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
What is it?

115
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Just a little gag giftsomebody gave me.

116
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
Put your hands together.

117
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
You're not the boss of me.

118
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
Yeah, you are.

119
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Saucy!

120
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
I'll be back in two minutes.

121
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
You're going to leave me like this?

122
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
Knowing you're here waiting for me.I think it's exciting, don't you?

123
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
If you don't come back soon...

124
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
...there's pretty muchnothing I can do about it!

125
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
I brought you back a macaroon.

126
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
Great. I'll keep it inmy butt with your nose.

127
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
That's weird.She locked the door.

128
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
You know why? She's gotthe bonus list in there.

129
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
I saw her working on it today.

130
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
Swear you won't tell.

131
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
When Mark left, he gave mea key to her office.

132
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
You want to see the list?

133
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
How are you?

134
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
Hello, Joanna...

135
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
- office.

136
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
I'll be a little longer.

137
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
- A couple hours.

138
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
This isn't funny.Get back here now!

139
00:08:29 --> 00:08:30
- I can't!- Why not?

140
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
I'm in my boss' car.

141
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
- Tunnel!

142
00:08:48 --> 00:08:48
What?

143
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
for a moment?

144
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
Okay, here's the situation.

145
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
The keys to the cuffsare on the door.

146
00:09:01 --> 00:09:02
Could you be a doll...

147
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
...and grab them andscoot on over here and unlock me?

148
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
And on a totally separate subject,that's a lovely pantsuit.

149
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
You promised you wouldbreak up with her.

150
00:09:13 --> 00:09:18
I did break up with her!She just took it really, really well!

151
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
Jeopardizing my careernever entered your mind?

152
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
It did enter my mind.

153
00:09:22 --> 00:09:27
But then something happenedthat made it shoot right out.

154
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
You got yourself into those cuffs,you get yourself out.

155
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
I can't get myself right out of them.

156
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
You must have me confused withthe "Amazing Chandler"!

157
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
Unlock me! She could be gonefor hours, and I'm cold and...

158
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
All right! This is it!

159
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
Never see her again.

160
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
Never!

161
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
Never come in here again.

162
00:09:49 --> 00:09:50
Fine!

163
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
Give me back my Walkman!

164
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
I never borrowed it.

165
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
Then I lost it.Buy me one!

166
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
You got it! Here we go!Come on. This is great!

167
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
Does it hurt?

168
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
No, I always see guys do thiswhen handcuffs are taken off.

169
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Hello, sweet pants!

170
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
Wait!What will you tell Joanna?

171
00:10:13 --> 00:10:13
About what?

172
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
She'll see you're gone and knowI let you out, and I'll get fired!

173
00:10:18 --> 00:10:19
I'll tell a lie!I'm good at lying!

174
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
I actually did borrow your Walkman!

175
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
She'll know I havea key to her office.

176
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
I've got to lock you back up.

177
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
I don't think so.

178
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
This is much better.

179
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
Here's somebody interesting.

180
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
What do you know about Van Gogh?

181
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
- He cut off his ear.- And?

182
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
I'm out.

183
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
He painted that.

184
00:10:51 --> 00:10:52
That's pretty nice.

185
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
I thought he cut off his earbecause he sucked.

186
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
- What else you got in there?- Let's see...

187
00:10:57 --> 00:11:01
- Where does the Pope live?- In the woods.

188
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
Wait, that's the joke answer.

189
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
Actually, it's Vatican City.

190
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
Now, what do you know aboutvulcanized rubber?

191
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
Spock's birth control.

192
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
You need these books.

193
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
This used to be your room?

194
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
You must have been inreally good shape as a kid.

195
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
I'm such an idiot!

196
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
I can't believe I thoughtshe could change.

197
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
Who cares what your mom thinks?

198
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
So you "pulled a Monica".

199
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
I'm glad that's catching on.

200
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
Why does that have to be a bad thing?Just change what it means.

201
00:11:41 --> 00:11:42
Prove your mother wrong.

202
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
You finish the job, andwe'll call that "pulling a Monica".

203
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
What?

204
00:11:48 --> 00:11:53
If a kid gets straight A's, hisparents say, "You pulled a Monica".

205
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
A fireman saves a baby,and they go, "He pulled a Monica".

206
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
Someone hits a homer, and they say,"That one's out of here".

207
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
Because some things don't change.

208
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
All right.I'll go down there.

209
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
I won't serve the lasagna.I'll serve what I make.

210
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
My breasts are really strong.

211
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
I have to get you locked back up.I'm so going to lose my job!

212
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
She's very private about her office!

213
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
Now I know why!

214
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
You're in trouble either way.

215
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
If she sees me locked to this...

216
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
...she'll know you were here.You might as well let me go.

217
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
- I'll clean your bathroom for a month.- Still won't be clean.

218
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
All I want is my freedom.

219
00:12:47 --> 00:12:48
- Foot rubs for a month!- Freedom!

220
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
- I'll put all your photos into albums!- I want my freedom!

221
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
Why won't you hear me!Sophie, help me!

222
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
Sophie, sit!

223
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
Would you just calm down?!

224
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
I'm going to say thisfor the last time.

225
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
Would you please just...

226
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
There's a lot I didn't knowabout vomit.

227
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
In a minute.

228
00:13:20 --> 00:13:21
So what do you say?

229
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
You get the whole setof encyclopedias for $1200.

230
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
That works out tojust 50 bucks a book.

231
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
$1200?

232
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
You think I have $1200?

233
00:13:32 --> 00:13:33
I'm home during the day...

234
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
...and I got patio furniturein my living room.

235
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
There's a few thingsyou don't get from book learning.

236
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
Well, what can you swing?

237
00:13:42 --> 00:13:46
How about zero down and zero a monthfor a long, long time?

238
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
You don't have anything?

239
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
You want to see what I got?

240
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
I got a baby Tootsie Roll...

241
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
...a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...

242
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
...a rock...

243
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
...and an army man.

244
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
Okay, I get the picture.Thanks for your time.

245
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
And a fifty.

246
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
These must be Chandler's pants.

247
00:14:09 --> 00:14:10
For $50 you can get one book.

248
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
What will it be?A? B? C?

249
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
I'll stick with the V.

250
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
I want to see howthis bad boy turns out.

251
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
I will buy and wrapall of your Christmas gifts!

252
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
I'll squeeze you fresh orange juiceevery morning!

253
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
With extra pulp?

254
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
I've got it!

255
00:14:34 --> 00:14:35
You don't have it.

256
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
I have so got it!

257
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
There will be rumors about this.No way to stop it.

258
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
Sophie, Monica and Phoebe know.

259
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
- How do they know?- I called them.

260
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
When they ask me what I saw...

261
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
...I can be very generous...

262
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
...or very stingy.

263
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
Go on.

264
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
I can make you a legend.

265
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
I can make youthis generation's Milton Berle.

266
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
- And Milton Berle has...- Not compared to you.

267
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
They're not eventouching the lasagna.

268
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
They love your casserole!

269
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
It's hard to believea while ago this was just ingredients.

270
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
Everyone seems to like your dish.

271
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
And you?

272
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
I thought it was...

273
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
...quite tasty.

274
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
So if everyone liked it,and you liked it...

275
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
...that would make this a success.Which would make you...

276
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
A bitch?

277
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
I meant "wrong",but we can use your word.

278
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
Yes, well, I was wrong.

279
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
And I have to say...

280
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
...you really impressed me today.

281
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
You might even say that she"pulled a Monica".

282
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
She doesn't know we switched it.

283
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
And the next time you cater for me...

284
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
...there will be nothing but icein the freezer.

285
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
That really means a lot.

286
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
Mom, don't bite your nails!

287
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
Hello, Chandler.

288
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
I love you.

289
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
What's going on?

290
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
No, he doesn't!

291
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
Two hours, that lasted.

292
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
So did you break up with Joanna?

293
00:16:26 --> 00:16:27
I think so.

294
00:16:27 --> 00:16:31
It's good you got out,before she blew up like Vesuvius.

295
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
The volcano?

296
00:16:33 --> 00:16:38
Speaking of volcanoes, man, are theya violent igneous rock formation!

297
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
Lava spewing, hot ash.

298
00:16:41 --> 00:16:42
Of course, some are dormant.

299
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
Why are you talking about volcanoesall of a sudden?

300
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
We don't have to.

301
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
What do you want to talk about?Vivisection?

302
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
The vas deferens?

303
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
The Vietnam War?

304
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
Did anyone see that documentaryon the Korean War?

305
00:16:58 --> 00:16:59
Korea's a beautiful country.

306
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
With such a sad history.

307
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
Could there be more Kims?

308
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
- Who's out there?- Me! Good morning!

309
00:17:13 --> 00:17:14
Could you come in here, please?

310
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
Sure! They didn't havepoppyseed bagels...

311
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
...so I have sesame...Oh, my word!

312
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
I've had a slight office mishap.

313
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
Could you get the key for me?

314
00:17:32 --> 00:17:33
So sorry!

315
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
Tell your friend Chandler we'redefinitely broken up now!
