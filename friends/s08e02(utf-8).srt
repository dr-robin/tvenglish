1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
Listen, I don't carewhat the computer says.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
We didn't take a bagof Meshugga Nuts.

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:11
Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
- Were you in our room last night?- No.

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
I was told the movie's namewouldn't appear on the bill.

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
- Checking out of the bridal suite.- Right, I'm no longer a bride.

7
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
I'll never be a bride again.Now I'm just someone's wife.

8
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
And I'm the happiest guyin the world.

9
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
- We have so much to look forward to.- Yeah, right.

10
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
- The honeymoon.- That's not till Thursday.

11
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
- Wedding pictures.- It takes weeks.

12
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
- Not the disposable cameras.- I knew I married you for a reason!

13
00:00:51 --> 00:00:54
I'll go get them developed,and you can go home.

14
00:00:56 --> 00:01:01
- What did you take a picture of?- Nothing. It was something.

15
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
Ross has the cameras.Is he checked out yet?

16
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
Are you joking?Checkout is not till noon.

17
00:01:06 --> 00:01:10
- And he has a good 11 minutes left.- So?

18
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
He never checks out a minutebefore he has to.

19
00:01:13 --> 00:01:18
Once we got a late checkout, he gotso excited, it was our best sex ever.

20
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
Until he screamed out "Radisson"at the end.

21
00:01:22 --> 00:01:26
Okay, I'll get Ross, get the camerasand get them developed.

22
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
Thirty-two, Joe. You're 32!

23
00:01:31 --> 00:01:33
- Here's your bill.- Thanks.

24
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
Champagne, strawberries...

25
00:01:36 --> 00:01:41
Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandlerordered porn on our wedding night.

26
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
Yeah, that's sad.Meshugga Nut?

30
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
Soaps, shampoos.Are you really taking all this?

31
00:02:23 --> 00:02:28
- Why not? It's included in the price.- Yeah, but you don't need...

32
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
- What is this?- Thread.

33
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
Score!Where are the disposable cameras?

34
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
- What cameras?- Last night I asked you to take them.

35
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
- No, you didn't.- Yes, before we cut the cake, I said...

36
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
Yeah, you asked me for a favor. Thenmy Uncle Murray gave you a check.

37
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
Then you said, "Why is it calleda check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"

38
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
- Yeah, then you did that.- So you don't have the cameras?

39
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
- No, sorry.- They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!

40
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
They're here somewhere.I'll help you look.

41
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
- Great.- In three minutes.

42
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
You're gonna open the presentswithout Chandler?

43
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
They're calling out to me.This guy even crawled into my lap.

44
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
He wouldn't mind if I opened one.What do you think it is?

45
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
A mirror that when you look into it,you see yourself as an old woman.

46
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
A tiny salt shaker!

47
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

48
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
Oh, wow! Okay, that was fun.

49
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
Okay, I'll wait for Chandlerto open up the rest.

50
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
Although, you know, this ispart of a salt-and-pepper set.

51
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
It's only half a present.What do you think?

52
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
It's okay to open one more ifit's a set. It's probably this one.

53
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
Or this one!

54
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
- Got any morning sickness?- The guys don't know, do they?

55
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
No. Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

56
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Right. Chandler still thinksI'm pregnant.

57
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
He hasn't asked me how I feel,or offered to carry my bags.

58
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
I feel bad for the womanwho ends up with him.

59
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
After you, of course.

60
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
You'll only be pregnant a few morehours. I'll tell the father today.

61
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
Is it that tall guyfrom the first floor?

62
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
- No!- What? I think he's cute.

63
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
- Then you have his baby.- I'm trying.

64
00:04:40 --> 00:04:45
It's so weird. You're gonna tellthis guy today, and he has no idea.

65
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
You'll just knock on his doorand change his life forever.

66
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
You're like Ed McMahon,except without the big check.

67
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
Or the raw sexual magnetism.

68
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
- Yeah, I guess it's pretty big news.- Pretty big? It's huge!

69
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
God, this guy is walkingaround thinking:

70
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
"I had sex with Rachel Green.I rock!"

71
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
Then, bam! He's a father,everything's different.

72
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
Only if he wants it to be.I won't ask for anything.

73
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
Okay, now he's walkingaround thinking:

74
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
"Do I want to be a dad?"Then, bam!

75
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
- What was that "bam"?- I don't know. He's hit by a bus.

76
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
Joey, what would you do if someone youslept with told you she was pregnant?

77
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
Who called here?

78
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
Did she sound blond? Any accent?I gotta make a call.

79
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
Should have never walkedinto that Sunglass Hut!

80
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
It's not you!You didn't get anyone pregnant.

81
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
Why would you scare me like that?What the hell's going on?

82
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
Is somebody pregnant?

83
00:05:53 --> 00:05:54
Oh, yeah! That's me.

84
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
Oh, my God, Pheebs!You're gonna have a baby?

85
00:05:59 --> 00:06:03
Yes, I am.Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!

86
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
- Wait, who's the father?- You don't know him.

87
00:06:06 --> 00:06:10
He wants nothing to dowith me or the baby.

88
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
Who is this guy? Because I'll trackhim down and kick his ass!

89
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
- David Linn.- David Linn!

90
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
- Who's David Linn?- Some annoying guy from my gym.

91
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
- Chandler?- Did you find the cameras?

92
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
- No. Did you?- Yes, that's why I'm under the table.

93
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
I checked in the lost and found.No one's turned them in.

94
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
Great. Those cameras were the onlything that will cheer Monica up.

95
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
You just got married.Why is she depressed?

96
00:06:47 --> 00:06:52
I'm not going to ask that question.I can't believe I screwed this up!

97
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
I'm sorry, man.

98
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
Here's a thought.This is the same ballroom.

99
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
There's a band.There'll be dressed-up people.

100
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Are you suggestingwe dance our troubles away?

101
00:07:04 --> 00:07:09
No, we buy more of these, throw ourtuxes on and take a few pictures.

102
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
We make sure notto get people's faces.

103
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
Are you serious?

104
00:07:13 --> 00:07:18
I'm thinking about your new bride.Do you really want to let her down?

105
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
Marriage advice? Really?

106
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
This looks just like your wedding.

107
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
- Same flowers?- I don't know. Monica picked them.

108
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
- The chairs?- Those too.

109
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
- The place settings?- Her.

110
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
- What did you do?- I took care of the cameras.

111
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
Gift shop?

112
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
- Did you do it yet?- Not yet.

113
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
Then what are you doing here?Are you about to do it?

114
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
Is it Gunther?

115
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
- It's not Gunther!- Thank God. That hair on a baby?

116
00:07:53 --> 00:07:58
The father is not here. I haven'ttold him, and I don't think I can now.

117
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
Why not?

118
00:07:59 --> 00:08:04
I was walking and thinking, "I'm gonnatell the father. " And then, bam!

119
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
Bus?

120
00:08:06 --> 00:08:11
No, you! You freaked me out.You kept saying how huge this is.

121
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
- But it is huge.- I know.

122
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
But I was thinkinghow huge it is for me.

123
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
I didn't think about the father.

124
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
You're thinking about it too much.Tell him and get it over with.

125
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,quick and painless.

126
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
Oh, mother of...!

127
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
See?

128
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
- Are we opening presents?- No. I shouldn't be opening these.

129
00:08:38 --> 00:08:42
Joey, I am out of control!You have to do me a favor.

130
00:08:42 --> 00:08:47
No matter what I say,do not let me open another present.

131
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
Give me one more.

132
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
Good, you're here. Pheebs?Listen...

133
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
Sit down,I got something I want to say.

134
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
It's a scary world out there,especially for a single mom.

135
00:09:10 --> 00:09:15
I always felt that youand I have a special bond.

136
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
So, Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

137
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
Oh, my God!

138
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.

139
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
- You can't marry him!- Your day's over, it's my turn.

140
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
- Why can't she marry me?- I can and I will.

141
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
She's not pregnant.Rachel's the one who's pregnant.

142
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
Oh, my God!

143
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
He'd noticewhen you didn't have a baby!

144
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
It's Joey!

145
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
I can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant?Who's the father?

146
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
We don't know.

147
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
- I wonder if it's that dude.- There's a dude?

148
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
Who is it?

149
00:10:01 --> 00:10:07
A month ago this guy spent the night.I didn't see who it was, but...

150
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
Was that story over?

151
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
The guy left this.

152
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
Oh, my God!I know who the father is.

153
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
People have gotto finish their stories.

154
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
- Could you take a picture of us?- Of course.

155
00:10:37 --> 00:10:42
- Would you take one of us?- Yeah, sure.

156
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
Click.

157
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
- It didn't click.- I heard it.

158
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
- There was no flash.- You won't take our picture?

159
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
Yeah, I'll take your picture.

160
00:10:53 --> 00:10:58
- Your finger was covering the lens.- Who are you, Ansel Adams? Scram!

161
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
I feel really bad about howI freaked you out before...

162
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
...so I asked the fatherto come here.

163
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
What? Wait a minute.How do you know who it is?

164
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
I may play the fool at times...

165
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
...but I'm more than a pretty blondwith an ass that won't quit.

166
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
I believe this belongs to the father.

167
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
Oh, God. He's in there right now?

168
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
You can turn around,or go in and rip the Band-Aid off.

169
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
- Let's rip.- Are you sure?

170
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
- Phoebe!- Sorry.

171
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Hey, Rach.

172
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
Go on-stage. I'll get a pictureof you doing the speech.

173
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
Will the owner of a 1995 LeSabresee the front desk?

174
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
Your car is about to be towed.

175
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
That's my car!

176
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
- A '95 LeSabre?- Yes.

177
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
- A green LeSabre?- Yes!

178
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
- I'm sorry, I meant blue.- Yes, green-blue.

179
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
Well, go. Go move it!

180
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
Ready for the last picture?Get ready to run.

181
00:12:35 --> 00:12:38
Congratulations on your wedding.

182
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
What's this about?

183
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
Rachel has something to tell you.

184
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
And I believe thatthis is your red sweater.

185
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
No, this is my red sweater.

186
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
Oh, no.

187
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
Could I get anyone a coffee?

188
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

189
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
What's going on?

190
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
Nothing.Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

191
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
But you wear that sweater a lot.Is it some kind of dare?

192
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
I'm actually glad Phoebe called.

193
00:13:21 --> 00:13:27
I was immature, but I've grown up.I think we should get back together.

194
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
It's not the right time.

195
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
It is the right time.I'm ready for more.

196
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
Let's give it another try.

197
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
I'm having a baby.

198
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
- You can go.- Thank you.

199
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
I don't know howany of these got opened!

200
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
- You opened them all?- I know, I am a terrible person.

201
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
Chandler won't trust me ever again.

202
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
- You got my parents' gift.- What is that?

203
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
I think it does somethingto salami.

204
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
- How'd it go?- What did Tag say?

205
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
Tag is not the father.And Joey knows now?

206
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16

207
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
Wow, you didn't even tryto unhook my bra.

208
00:14:23 --> 00:14:27
- Will you ever tell whoever it is?- I will, just not tonight.

209
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
No matter what he says,you're not gonna be alone.

210
00:14:30 --> 00:14:31

211
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
No. Listen...

212
00:14:35 --> 00:14:40
It's a scary world out there,especially for a single mom.

213
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
I've always felt likeyou and I have a special bond.

214
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46

00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
- Pheebs, give me the ring back.- No!

00:14:51 --> 00:14:56
Joey, you're so sweet, honey,but I'm not looking for a husband.

217
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
I understand.

218
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
If you'll excuse me,I'm going to go and lie down.

219
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
I can't say that didn't hurt.

220
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
- But I'll take you back, Joey.- About that, l...

221

00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
And interesting, because I foundthe cameras in one of our bags.

230
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50

Okay, this isn't our first kiss...

232
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
...but it is my first kisswith this lady.

233
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
Which I'm sure you'll remember,so there's no need...

234
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
- I'll take these to get developed now.- Good idea.

235
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
