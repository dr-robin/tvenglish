00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
Guys! Guys! I've got greatnews. Guess what.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
- Monica's pregnant!- Really?

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
Let's get past the moment.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
- What's your news?- Thank you.

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
I got a job in advertising.

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
Honey, that's incredible!

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
Gosh, what's the pay like?

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
Oh, come on, people.

9
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
If I don't know who makes the most...

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
...how do I know whoI like the most? Hi, Joey.

11
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
It pays nothing. It's an internship.

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
We have interns at "Days of Our Lives".

13
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
Right. So it'll be the same,except less sex with you.

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
What do you think they'llhave you do there?

15
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
It's a training program, but theyhire the people they like.

16
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
- That's great!- There's gonna be some grunt work...

17
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
...which will stink. A grown mangetting people coffee is humiliating.

18
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
Humiliating and noble.

19
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
Thank you.

20
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
You know, if I didn'talready have a job...

21
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
...I would've been good in advertising.

22
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
Ross, you did not come up with:"Got Milk?"

23
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
Yes, I did! I did!

24
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
I should've written it down.

00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
Where's Chandler? I want to wishhim good luck on his first day.

29
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
And I smelled bacon.

30
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
- He just left.- Who did?

31
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
Joey, you're never gonnabelieve it! She called!

32
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
- She did?- You got it!

33
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
- I did?- What is she talking about?

34
00:02:00 --> 00:02:01
I don't know, but it sounds great!

35
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
Your agent called.You got that audition!

36
00:02:03 --> 00:02:04
- With Leonard Hayes?- Yes!

37
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
Oh, my God, that is great!It's for a play on Broadway.

38
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
And in a real theater. Not that littleone underneath the deli like last time.

39
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
- Is it a good play?- It must be.

40
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
I read it and didn'tunderstand a single word!

41
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
- Leonard Hayes is starring in it.- Yeah, and directing.

42
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
He was so good inthat movie of "Macbeth".

43
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
- You saw that?- No, but I saw the previews.

44
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
They played it right before "Jackass".

45
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
- He's done some amazing work.- Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
I loved him in those phone commercials.

47
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
When the monkey hits him in the facewith the giant rubber phone...

48
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Maybe the monkeywill be at the audition.

49
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
Don't make me more nervousthan I already am!

50
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
- Good morning.- Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?

51
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
Oh, no, no. I'm an intern,just like you guys.

52
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
Except for the tie, the briefcaseand the fact that I can rent a car.

53
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Seriously, you're an intern?

54
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
I'm heading in a new career directionand you gotta start at the bottom.

55
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Dude.

56
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
I know I'm a little older than you guys,but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.

57
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
The comedian. USO.

58
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
It's U.S.A., sir.

59
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
This is Joey Tribbiani.Joey, these are the producers.

60
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
And as you probably alreadyknow, this is Leonard Hayes.

61
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
It is so amazing to meet you.I am such a big fan of your work.

62
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
I've been blessed witha lot of great roles.

63
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
Tell me about it, huh?"Unlimited nights and weekends!"

64
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
Are you making fun of me?Because I am not a sellout.

65
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
I didn't do it for money.I believe in those phones!

66
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
I almost lost a cousin becauseof bad wireless service.

67
00:03:47 --> 00:03:50
No, I wasn't making fun of you. I thinkyou were great in those commercials.

68
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
- Really?- Yeah.

69
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
Well, I do bring a certaincredibility to the role.

70
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Are you kidding? When they shootyou out of that cannon...

71
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
"Hang up that phone!"

72
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
- One take.- Wow.

73
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
- So shall we read?- Oh, yeah, sure.

74
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
Top of Act 2. This is my entrance.You got it?

75
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
What the hell are you still doing here?

76
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
- I think you know.- Bastard!

77
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
I am what you made me.You know what? I could go right now.

78
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
- Go! Go!- I can't.

79
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
Oh, I want to, Long Pause...

80
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
...but I can't.

81
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
So sorry. You're not supposedto say "long pause."

82
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
Oh! Oh, I thought that was yourcharacter's name. You know?

83
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
I thought you were, like, an Indianor something, you know, with the...

84
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
No. Thank you so much for coming in.We appreciate it. Thank you.

85
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
You don't want me to do it again?

86
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
- I could do an accent.- No.

87
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
You know, Southern."I could go right now, mon!" Huh?

88
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
My God in heaven.

89
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
Joey, hang on. Leonard, canwe talk to you for a moment?

90
00:05:03 --> 00:05:08
Yes? You've got to be kidding.He can't act.

91
00:05:08 --> 00:05:09
I don't care if you think he's hot.

92
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
If you want to sleep with him,do it on your own time. This is a play.

93
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
If you insist on this...

94
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
...I will call my agent so fast...

95
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
...on a cell phone connection so clear,he's gonna think I'm next door!

96
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
Hi, thank you so much forwhispering for my benefit.

97
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
Tell me what I did wrong. I'd love towork on it and try it again for you.

98
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
And also, how you doing?

99
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
Give me another chance.I really want to get better. Please?

100
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
If you want to come back today...

101
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
...here are my notes. Ready?- Yeah.

102
00:05:42 --> 00:05:47
- You're in your head. Thinking too much.- I really doubt that.

103
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
No, no. It's that you're notconnected with anything in your body.

104
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
There's no urgency.The scene is a struggle.

105
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
It's a race.Also, what you did was horizontal.

106
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.

107
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
And don't learn the words.Let the words learn you.

108
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?

109
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Hey, do you want to goto dinner tonight?

110
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
I can't. I've got a datewith that waitress, Katie.

111
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
I know we've only gone out,like, twice, but I don't know...

112
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
...I have a good feeling about her.- Oh, I hear divorce bells.

113
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
Give me your wallets,and there won't be a problem.

114
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
- What?- I have a gun.

115
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
Okay, relax, Phoebe.Just stay calm.

116
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
Oh, my God, I can't find my wallet!

117
00:06:33 --> 00:06:36
- All right, lady, now give me your purse.- No.

118
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
What do you mean "no"? I knew you'dbe my death, Phoebe Buffay!

119
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
- Lowell, is that you?- Phoebe?

120
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
- Oh, my God!- Unbelievable! Oh, my God!

121
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
I'm sorry. Ross, this is my old friend,Lowell, from the streets!

122
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
- Lowell, Ross.- Ross, nice to meet you.

123
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Yeah, a real pleasure.

124
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
It's been so long! Oh, so long.

125
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
- I can't believe you're still doing this.- I know. But I quit smoking.

126
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
Good for you.

127
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
You look like you're doing well.

128
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
I guess your mugging daysare behind you.

129
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
Oh, my God.Phoebe, you used to mug people?

130
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
Excuse me, Ross,old friends catching up.

131
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
- How'd the audition go?- They want to see me again, but...

132
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
...Leonard Hayes did not like me.

133
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
- What happened?- He said I wasn't urgent enough.

134
00:07:25 --> 00:07:30
Everything I did was horizontal,and I should be more vertical.

135
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
- He said that I should think less.- Well, so far so good.

136
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
Honey, I'm old!

137
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
What's wrong?

138
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
I am so much older than these otherinterns. I can't compete with them.

139
00:07:43 --> 00:07:44
So you're a little older.

140
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
Look at the positive.You have all this life experience.

141
00:07:46 --> 00:07:51
Yes, but I don't think life experienceis gonna help me with these.

142
00:07:51 --> 00:07:56
Wow! It's like they're on fire!

143
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
- What are they?- Prototype sneakers.

144
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
I need ideas on how to sell them.Which I can't do...

145
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
...because no self-respectingadult would ever wear these.

146
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
I'll give you $500 for them.

147
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
- What am I supposed to do?- Come on, sneakers are easy.

148
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
- You wear them all the time.- They're not called sneakers anymore.

149
00:08:16 --> 00:08:21
They're called "kicks" or "skids."I think I heard somebody say "slorps."

150
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
They've got wheels that pop out fromthe bottom so you can roll around...

151
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
...because apparentlywalking is too much exercise.

152
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
"Kids! Kids! Roll yourway to childhood obesity!"

153
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
Would you help me try to sell these?

154
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
Okay. Have you consideredusing a girl with huge knockers?

155
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
That's not what they're looking for.

156
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
Hey, that would work on me.

157
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
Why do you think I buyMrs. Butterworth's?

158
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
You'll never guess what just happened.

159
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
- Phoebe and I got mugged!- Are you okay?

160
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.

161
00:09:01 --> 00:09:02
How do you know a mugger?

162
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
I'm sorry, I have friendsoutside the six of us.

163
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
Know how she knew him?Because Phoebe used to mug people.

164
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
Seriously?

165
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
Well, I'm not proud of it,but, you know...

166
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
...when I was living on the street andI needed money for food and stuff...

167
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
- That is awful.- I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?

168
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.

169
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
I had a hard life.My mother was killed by a drug dealer.

170
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
- Your mother killed herself.- She was a drug dealer.

171
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
It was a good thing she knew him.I was about to do some serious damage.

172
00:09:36 --> 00:09:37
Okay.

173
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
This must have brought backsome bad memories for you, Ross.

174
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
- Why?- Ross was mugged as a kid.

175
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
- You were?- Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.

176
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.

177
00:09:48 --> 00:09:52
I was minding my business, seeing whatkind of trouble Spider-Man was into.

178
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
Wonder Woman.

179
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
Anyway, I was headingtowards this bakery...

180
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
...to pick up a couple of dozenlinzer tortes for someone...

181
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
...when out of nowhere, this thugwith a pipe jumps out and says:

182
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
- "Give me your money, punk!"- Oh, my God.

183
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
I know. And the worst partwas, they took my backpack...

184
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
...which had all the original artwork I didfor my own comic book, "Science Boy".

185
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
Oh, yeah! What washis super power again?

186
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
A super-human thirst for knowledge.

187
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
I better get to class.

188
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
Are there any more of yourfriends I should look out for?

189
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
No. Actually, you might want to stayaway from Jane Street.

190
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
That's where Stabby Joe works.

191
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
- I think we have a problem here.- What?

192
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
Back in my mugging days,I worked St. Mark's Comics.

193
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
- Yeah?- A pipe was my weapon of choice...

194
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
...and preteen, comic-book nerdswere my meat.

195
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
So?

196
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
There was one kid who hada sticker on his backpack that said:

197
00:10:51 --> 00:10:52
- "Geology rocks!"- "Geology rocks!"

198
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
- Oh, my God!- I know! I mugged Ross!

199
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
- You're late.- I know. I'm sorry.

200
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
But can I just run to the bathroom?

201
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
- No. Leonard doesn't wait.- But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!

202
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Joey, here we go!Let's go. Very quickly.

203
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
- I really need...- We must go now, quickly.

204
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
- Yeah. Yes, sir.- Ready?

205
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
- What the hell are you still doing here?- I think you know!

206
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
- Oh, you sick bastard!- I am what you made me! Know what?

207
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
- What?- I could go right now.

208
00:11:29 --> 00:11:34
- Then go. Go!- Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!

209
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
Cut. That was good!

210
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
- Very good. You did everything I asked.- I did?

211
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
Yes. Plus which, you've got this,I don't know, this squirmy quality...

212
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
...you bring to the characterI couldn't have imagined.

213
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
Here's what we're gonna do:

214
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
Come back tomorrowfor the final callbacks.

215
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
Do all of this, what you gotgoing now. But you know what?

216
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
More. More. Can you do that?

217
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
Sure. I don't have time to saythank you because I really gotta go!

218
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
Look at that! Still in character.I like him.

219
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
I plant seeds. I can't explain it.I don't know.

220
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
- Hey. What are you doing?- Putting on the sneakers...

221
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
...to get in the young mindset,see if it sparks anything.

222
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
- Oh, anything yet?- Yes, how's this?

223
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
"They're so uncomfortable, it's likegetting kicked in the nuts for your feet."

224
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
You're probably wonderingwhat I'm doing.

225
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
No, that seems about right.

226
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.Apparently, that makes me a good actor.

227
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
I got a callback, so I'm drinkingeverything. Oh, by the way...

228
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
...that eggnog in our fridge was great!

229
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
- Joey, that was formula.- We gotta get more of that.

230
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
These aren't half bad. You shouldsuggest these to Ralph Lauren.

231
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
Okay, first of all, that's stupid.Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.

232
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
All right. I feel younger already.

233
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
Yeah, I think I broke my hip.

234
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
- Hey, you!- Hey.

235
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
Hey. How was class?

236
00:13:11 --> 00:13:12
No one asks me that. What's wrong?

237
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
- Nothing. I really want to know.- Oh.

238
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
Well, there was actually a rather livelydiscussion about the Pleistocene...

239
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
All right, nothing is worth this.

240
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
I have a confession to make.

241
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
Okay, you know that girl thatmugged you when you were a kid?

242
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
What are you talking about?It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.

243
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
You don't have to lie anymore.I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.

244
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
- No, it wasn't.- Yes, it was.

245
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
You don't think I would have defendedmyself against a 14-year-old...?

246
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
- "Give me your money, punk!"- Oh, my God, it was you!

247
00:13:44 --> 00:13:47
I can't believe it. You mugged me?

248
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.I'm sorry.

249
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
But, you know, if you thinkabout it, it's kind of neat.

250
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
I mean, well, it's just that I'vealways felt kind of like an outsider.

251
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
You know, the rest of you haveconnections that go way back...

252
00:14:01 --> 00:14:05
...and, you know, now youand I have a great one.

253
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
It's not the best!

254
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
I know. Please forgive me.I don't know what to say.

255
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
There's nothing you can say! That wasthe most humiliating thing ever.

256
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
- Even more humiliating than...- Let's not do this!

257
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
And then, at the end of the commercial,the girls get out of the hot tub...

258
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
...and start makingout with each other.

259
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
That's interesting.

260
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
Just one thought: You didn'tmention the shoes.

261
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
Who's next? Chandler.

262
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
You start with a guyputting on the shoes.

263
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
- He's about my age.- Your age?

264
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
He's rolling down the streetand he starts to lose control.

265
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
Maybe he falls.Maybe he hurts himself.

266
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
Just then, a kid comes flyingby wearing the shoes.

267
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
He jumps over the old guy and laughs.And the line reads:

268
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
"Not suitable for adults."

269
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
- Well, Chandler, that's great.- Thank you, sir.

270
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
Or, man who's twoyears younger than me.

271
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
You see, that has a clear selling point.It appeals to our key demographic.

272
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
- How did you come up with that?- I don't know! I don't know!

273
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
I was just trying to get into a youngmindset, and stuff started to flow.

274
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
- That is great. Good work.- Thank you.

275
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
We'll see all of you tomorrow.

276
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
The cold weather hurts my hip.

277
00:15:32 --> 00:15:37
Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad atme, but can I just talk to you for a sec?

278
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.Sure, go ahead.

279
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
I just really wanted to apologize again.

280
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
And also show you somethingI think you'll find very exciting.

281
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Oh, my God! "Crap from the street!"

282
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
Look, Ross. In this box...

283
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
...are all the things I got from muggingthat I thought were too special to sell...

284
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
...or smoke.

285
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
Anyway, I was lookingthrough it, and I found...

286
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
..."Science Boy."

287
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
Oh, my God!

288
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
I never thought I'd see this again.

289
00:16:18 --> 00:16:19
It's all here!

290
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
What made you saveit all these years?

291
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
I guess I just thoughtit was really good.

292
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
And maybe it would beworth something one day.

293
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
You really thought "Science Boy"was worth saving?

294
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
Yeah. But you should know I also have ajar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.

295
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
Still, this is amazing!

296
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.

297
00:16:41 --> 00:16:45
You're welcome. Thank you forScience Boy. I learned a lot from him.

298
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
You're welcome.

299
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
- I need an answer!- I can't tell you something I don't know.

300
00:16:52 --> 00:16:53
- You know!- I don't know!

301
00:16:53 --> 00:16:58
- I need an answer now!- You want an answer? The answer is...

302
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
She never loved me.She only loved you.

303
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
You knew this all alongand you never told me?

304
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
I can never forgive you, or myself. I havenothing to live for. Bang! And scene!

305
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
Absolutely amazing.

306
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
- The part is yours.- Thanks! Now I really gotta go.

307
00:17:21 --> 00:17:25
No, wait! Congratulations!You did it.

308
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.

309
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
Wow! That's a big cable bill.

310
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
You don't have a job,but you have no problem ordering porn.

311
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
On a Saturday afternoon?

312
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
I was in the house!

313
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
Hey. Phoebe didn't by anychance mention that...

314
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
She was the huge guy thatmugged you? Yeah.

315
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
I see. You didn't happen to tell...

316
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
- Everybody we know? Yeah.- Great. Thanks.

317
00:18:04 --> 00:18:05
