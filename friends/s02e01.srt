I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
This is pretty muchwhat's happened so far.

4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
with Rachel since forever.

5
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
something got in the way...

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
... like cats, Italian guys.

7
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
like, "Forget about her".

8
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.

9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
She was, like, "Oh, my God!"

10
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
So she went to the airport to meet him.

11
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
off the plane with another woman.

12
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
That's pretty much everythingyou need to know.

13
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
But enough about us.How have you been?

00:00:29 --> 00:00:32

00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
from Beijing now arriving.

17
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
Oh, my God!

19
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
Excuse me.

20
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
Move, move, move!Emergency, please!

21
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
Excuse me, excuse me.

22
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
There you are!

23
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
So, so...

24
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
How was China? You!

25
00:01:37 --> 00:01:38
It was great.

26
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
What happened?

27
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
- You're bleeding.- I am?

28
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

29
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
Enough about me,Mr. Back From The Orient!

30
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
Come on, I wanna hear everything!Everything!

31
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
Well, where do I start?

32
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
This is Julie.Julie, this is Rachel.

33
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
These are...

34
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
These are...

35
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
...aren't for you.

36
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
These are for you.

37
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
Welcome to our country.

38
00:02:07 --> 00:02:11
Thank you. I'm from New York.

39
00:02:11 --> 00:02:15
No problem. We'll use themto stop the bleeding.

40
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
Baggage claim?

41
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
She went to the airport, andshe's gonna go for it with Ross.

42
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
Oh, my God! This is huge!

43
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
This is bigger than huge.This is...

44
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
All right, what's bigger than huge?

45
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
This?

46
00:02:37 --> 00:02:38
Guys, you got new haircuts!

47
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
Yes, we did.Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

48
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
Because, you know, "If you don'tlook good, we don't look good."

49
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
I love that voice!

50
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
You guys!

51
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
Airport. Airport. Ross.

52
00:02:51 --> 00:02:52
Not alone.

53
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
Julie.

54
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Arm around her!

55
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

56
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
I think she's tryingto tell us something.

57
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
Quick, get the verbs.

58
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
You! You!

59
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
You said he liked me!

60
00:03:06 --> 00:03:06
You!

61
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
You slowpokes!

62
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
That's all right.We got the bags.

63
00:03:14 --> 00:03:15
This is my sister, Monica.

64
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
This is Chandler.

65
00:03:17 --> 00:03:18
Phoebe, hi.

66
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
Joey.

67
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
Everyone, this is Julie.

68
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
Julie.

69
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
But I'm not here,you haven't met me.

70
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
I'll make a better impression whenI don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

71
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
- And bus.- Oh, my God!

72
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
- With the screaming guy...- And the spitting.

73
00:03:36 --> 00:03:37
You gotta hear this story.

74
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
We're on this busthat's 200 years old.

75
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
Two hundred, at least.

76
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
And the chicken poops in her lap!

77
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
I'm so sorry.

78
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

79
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
I just heard this story in the cab...

80
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
...and it is all I can think about.

81
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
This is amazing.

82
00:04:01 --> 00:04:02
How did this happen?

83
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
We were in grad school together.

84
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
We haven't seen each other since then.I land in China...

85
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
...guess who's in charge of the dig?

86
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
Julie!

87
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
Isn't that great?

88
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

89
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
It's an expression.

90
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

91
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
- Then we'll see the baby.- Then get some sleep.

92
00:04:24 --> 00:04:25
It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

93
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
Don't tell us what's gonna happen.I like being surprised.

94
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Bye!

95
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
- Can I get some coffee?- Sure.

96
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
- Did you talk to him yet?- No.

97
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
Then, no.

98
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
What the hell happened to you in China?

99
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
When last we left you,you were in love with, you know.

100
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
I know I was.

101
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
But there was always this voiceinside that kept saying:

102
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
"It's never gonna happen. Move on."You know whose voice that was?

103
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
God?

104
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
It was you, pal.

105
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
Maybe it was God doing me.

106
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
You were right. She looks at meand sees a friend. That's all.

107
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
And then I met Julie...

108
00:05:22 --> 00:05:23
...and we're having a great time.

109
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
I never would have gone for it,if it hadn't been for you.

110
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

111
00:05:30 --> 00:05:31
Your lemonade.

112
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
I didn't order it.

113
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Then go take that back.They'll charge you for that.

114
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40
Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

115
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
So what did you find out?

116
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
He said...

117
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
He said...

118
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
They're having a great time.

119
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
But the silver lining,if you wanna see it...

121
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
...is that he made this decisionall by himself...

122
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
...without any outside help whatsoever.

123
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
How is that a silver lining?

124
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
You have to really wanna see it.

125
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
Ironically, these guyswere picked last in gym.

126
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
Hey, Pheebs.

127
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
You know what I'm thinking?

128
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
How...

129
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
...it's been so longsince you've had sex...

130
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
...you're wonderingif they've changed it?

131
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
No. Although nowthat's what I'm thinking.

132
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
So what were you thinking?

133
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
You gave the guys great haircuts.I thought you'd like to do mine.

134
00:06:35 --> 00:06:36
No.

135
00:06:36 --> 00:06:37
Why not?

136
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
Because I'm just...

137
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
I'm incredibly anal andan unbelievable control freak.

138
00:06:42 --> 00:06:43
No, you're not.

139
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
I know I'm not, but you are.

140
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
I was trying to spare your feelings.

141
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
Hold on.

142
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
Ross, Julie for you.

143
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
Anybody know a good tailor?

144
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
You need clothes altered?

145
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
No, I'm just looking for a manto draw on me with chalk.

146
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
Go see Frankie. My family'sbeen going to him forever.

147
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
He did my first suit when I was 15.

148
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
No, wait, 16.

149
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
No, excuse me, 15.

150
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
All right, when was 1990?

151
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
You have to stop the Q-Tipwhen there's resistance!

152
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

153
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
Okay, bye.

154
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
That is so sweet.

155
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
Okay. No, you hang up.

156
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
No, you...

157
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
One, two, three.

158
00:07:45 --> 00:07:46
You didn't hang up either.

159
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
She didn't hang up.

160
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
No, you hang up.

161
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
You. You.

162
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
Sorry, I thoughtyou were talking to me.

163
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
Rachel.

164
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
I'll just call her back.

165
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.We got disconnected.

166
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
No, you hang up.

167
00:08:14 --> 00:08:15
How did this happen to me?

168
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

169
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

170
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

171
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
...this really great guythat I can't have.

172
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

173
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
I know you did.

174
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
I'm just gonna deal with it.

175
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
I gotta get out of here!

176
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
I don't care what you guys say,something's bothering her.

177
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
You know, I think I was 16.

178
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
Please, just a little bit off the back.

179
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
I'm still on "no".

180
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
Morning.

181
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

182
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
No, no, no. I'm notfalling for that again.

183
00:09:04 --> 00:09:05
What's going on?

184
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

185
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
What stupid thing did you do?

186
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
Why don't you just go get dressed...

187
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
...then you'll be on your way.Bye-bye.

188
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
How did this happen?

189
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
I kind of ran into him last night.

190
00:09:26 --> 00:09:27
- Where?- At his apartment.

191
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
Is this juice?

192
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
And the fact that you dumped himbecause he hit on Phoebe?

193
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
Oh, God, I know.I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

194
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
Honey, you're not pathetic.You're just sad.

195
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
People do stupid thingswhen they're upset.

196
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
My God, if I had a nickelfor every guy I wish I hadn't...

197
00:09:45 --> 00:09:49
But this is about your horrible mistake.

198
00:09:51 --> 00:09:52
Sorry we're late.

199
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
We were...

200
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
Well, there was touching.

201
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
Hey, Ross!

202
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
What a...

203
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
What are you doing here?

204
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
I do Raquel!

205
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
So he's back?

206
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
Yeah, he's back.Is that a problem?

207
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
No, not a problem.

208
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

209
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

210
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
Despite the yummy bagelsand palpable tension...

211
00:10:29 --> 00:10:30
...my pants need to be altered.

212
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
When you see Frankie,tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

213
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
He'll know what it means.

214
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
You sure he'll crack that code?

215
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
It's funny. The last time Paolowas here, my hair was so much cuter.

216
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
All right.

217
00:10:45 --> 00:10:49
But you have to promise that youwill not be all controlly and bossy...

218
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
...and all Monica about it.

219
00:10:52 --> 00:10:52
I promise.

220
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
All right, let's see.

221
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
Now, some of you are gonna get cutand some of you aren't.

222
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
But I promise, none of youwill feel a thing.

223
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
- That's it. I quit.- What? I didn't say anything!

224
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
But this isn't the face ofa person who trusts a person.

225
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
This is the face ofa person who, you know...

226
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
...doesn't trust a person.

227
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

228
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
It's just a little shorterthan what we had discussed.

229
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
Would you relax?I know what I am doing.

230
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
This is how he wears it.

231
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
How who wears it?

232
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
Demi Moore.

233
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
Demi Moore is not a "he".

234
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
Well, he was a "he"in "Arthur" and in "10".

235
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
That's Dudley Moore!

236
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

237
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
Oh, my God!

238
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
Oh, God!

239
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

240
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
Which one is Demi Moore?

241
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

242
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
She's got gorgeous hair.

243
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
I know!

244
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
How long do you want the cuffs?

245
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
At least as long as I have the pants.

246
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
I just got that.

247
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
Now we'll do your inseam.

248
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
How is she?

249
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
It's too soon to tell.

250
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
She's resting, which is a good sign.

251
00:12:37 --> 00:12:38
How's the hair?

252
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
I'm not gonna lie to you.It doesn't look good.

253
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
I put a clip on one side, which seemsto have stopped the curling.

254
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
Can we see her?

255
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
Your hair looks too good.It'd upset her.

256
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
Ross, you come on in.

257
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
Well, how you doing?

258
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
I'm okay.

259
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
That bad, huh?

260
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
Look, I can sense when womenare depressed and vulnerable.

261
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
It's one of my gifts.

262
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
Joey, when I saw himget off that plane with her...

263
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
...I really thoughtI just hit rock bottom.

264
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
But today, it's likethere's rock bottom...

265
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
...50 feet of crap...

266
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
...then me.

267
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
Tell Ross how you feel.

268
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
Come on, how can I just tell him?What about Julie?

269
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
What about her? They've onlybeen going out for two weeks.

270
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
Ross has been in lovewith you for 10 years.

271
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
I don't know. I don't know.

272
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
I've been with my share of women.

273
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
I've been with a lotof people's share of women.

274
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
But the point is...

275
00:13:42 --> 00:13:47
...I've never felt about anyonethe way Ross felt about you.

276
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
Really?

277
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56
Yo, paisan!

278
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
Can I talk to you for a sec?

279
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
Your tailor...

280
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
...is a very bad man!

281
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
What are you talking about?

282
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
Hey, what's going on?

283
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
Joey's tailor...

284
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
...took advantage of me.

285
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
No way! I've been goingto the guy for 12 years.

286
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

287
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
Then he ran his hand up my legand then there was definite...

288
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
What?

289
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
Cupping.

290
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
That's how they do pants!

291
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
First they go up one side,they move it over.

292
00:14:39 --> 00:14:44
Then they go up the other side,move it back, then they do the rear.

293
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
Ross, tell him. Isn't thathow a tailor measures pants?

294
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
Yes, yes, it is.In prison!

295
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
What's the matter with you?

296
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
What?

297
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
That's not?

298
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
Oh, my God!

299
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
Even Mary Tyler Moorewould've been better.

300
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
I like it.

301
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
I do. I think it's a 10!

302
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
Thank you.

303
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
My hair is very amused.

304
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Come on, things could be worse.

305
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
You could "get caught betweenthe moon and New York City.

306
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
I know it's crazy, but it's true."

307
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
Thank you.

308
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

309
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
Bye, Rach!

310
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
Wait, are you leaving?

311
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
That's what I meant by "bye".

312
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
Can I talk to you for a sec?

313
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
When the doctor doesthat hernia test...

314
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
That's okay.

315
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
What's going on?

316
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
Well, okay, first of all...

317
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
...Paolo and I are not back together.

318
00:16:03 --> 00:16:04
That was a stupid thing I did.

319
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
If I could go back in timeand do it again...

320
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
...well, I wouldn't.

321
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
Second of all...

322
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
What?

323
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
Is this one of those thingswhere you break up with a guy...

324
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
...I tell you what I think...

325
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
...and the next dayyou get back together with him...

326
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
...and I look likea complete idiot?

327
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

328
00:16:29 --> 00:16:33
I hate him. I mean, I actually...I physically hate him.

329
00:16:33 --> 00:16:34
I always have.

330
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
And you are way too goodto be with a guy like that.

331
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
Really?

332
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
You deserve to be with someonewho appreciates you...

333
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
...and who gets how funny...

334
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
...and sweet and amazing...

335
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
...and adorable and sexy you are.

336
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
You know? Someone who wakes upevery morning thinking:

337
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"

338
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
You know? Someonewho makes you feel good.

339
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
Like the way I do with Julie.

340
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
Was there a "second of all"?

341
00:17:10 --> 00:17:14
No, I think that was the whole "all".

342
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
I gotta go.

343
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
Thanks.

344
00:17:24 --> 00:17:25
No, I swear to God, Dad!

345
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
That's not how they measure pants!

346
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
I was thinking of doing it shorter,like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

347
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
- Yeah, I could do that.- Really?

348
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
- You wanna do it now?- Great!

349
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
See you.

350
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
I just wanna makereally sure this time.

351
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
Andie MacDowell is the girl from"Four Weddings and a Funeral", right?

352
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
No.

353
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
That's Roddy McDowall.

354
00:17:57 --> 00:18:00
Andie MacDowell is the guyfrom "Planet of the Apes".

355
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
- Thank you.- You're welcome.
