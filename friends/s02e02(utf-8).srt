00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
These were expensiveand he'll grow out of them...

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
...in 20 minutes,but I couldn't resist!

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Look at these.

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
Hey, Ben.

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
"Just do it"!

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:21
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
Was that too muchpressure for him?

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
- Is he hungry already?- I guess so.

11
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
You know, it's...

12
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
Something funny about sneakers.I'll be right back.

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
I gotta get one too.

14
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
Hey, what are you guys doing?

15
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
We're just hanging outby the spoons.

16
00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
Ladle?

17
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
Will you guys grow up?

18
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
This is the most beautifulthing in the world.

19
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
Yeah, we know.But there's a baby sucking on it.

20
00:00:51 --> 00:00:56
This is my son having lunch, okay?It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

21
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
If you're uncomfortable,just ask questions.

22
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
Carol's fine with it.

23
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
Carol?

24
00:01:05 --> 00:01:10
I'm wondering, could Joey ask youa question about breast-feeding?

25
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
Sure.

26
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
Does it hurt?

27
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
It did at first, but not anymore.

28
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
Chandler?

29
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
So, how often can you do it?

30
00:01:23 --> 00:01:24
As much as he needs.

31
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
Okay, I got one, I got one.

32
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
If he blows into one,does the other one get bigger?

42
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32

43
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
Anyone want to cometake advantage of it?

44
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38

47
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49

00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
You can't go shopping with her.What about Rachel?

49
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Will it be a problem?

50
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
You're going toBloomingdale's with Julie.

51
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
It's like cheating on Rachelin her house of worship.

52
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
Monica, she will kill you.

53
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
She will kill youlike a dog in the street!

54
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
So Jules tells me you guysare going shopping tomorrow.

55
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
It's actually not that big a deal.

56
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
It's a big deal to me.This is great.

57
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
I really appreciate this.

62
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
Did you hear about the new guy?

63
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
Nobody knows his name. Me andthe girls call him "The Hombre Man".

64
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
Hombre?

65
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
What's he doing in my section?

66
00:04:00 --> 00:04:01
I guess he doesn't know.

67
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Well, he's gonna.

68
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06

73
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
...from young men's tothe escalator is my territory.

74
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
"Your territory"?

75
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
- Bijan for men?- No, thanks.

76
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
Hombre?

77
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
Yeah, all right.

78
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
You were saying?

79
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,and we were shopping all day.

80
00:04:40 --> 00:04:41
We shopped and we had lunch.

81
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
What did I have?

82
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
- You had a salad.- No wonder I don't feel full.

83
00:04:47 --> 00:04:47
Hi. What's up?

84
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
I went shopping with Monicaand I had a salad.

85
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
Good, Pheebs.What'd you buy?

86
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
We went shopping for...

87
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
For...

88
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
For fur.

89
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
You went shopping for fur?

90
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
And then I realizedthat I'm against that.

91
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
So then we bought some...

92
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Boobs.

93
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
You bought boobs?

94
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
Bras!

95
00:05:22 --> 00:05:23
We bought bras!

96
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
We bought bras.

97
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
Bijan for men?

98
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
Bijan for men?

99
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
Bijan for...

100
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
Hey, Annabel.

101
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
I was wondering if after workwe could grab a cup of coffee?

102
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
Actually, I sort of have plans.

103
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
You ready, Annabel?

104
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
You bet.

105
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
Maybe some other time.

106
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
It's not the first time I lost a girlto a cowboy spraying cologne.

107
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Bijan for men?

108
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
Bijan for men!

109
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
And this is Funny Clown.

110
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
It's only for after his naps,not before, or he won't sleep.

111
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
We've been through this before.We have a good time.

112
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
We laugh, we play.It's like we're father and son.

113
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
Honey, relax.Ross is great with him.

114
00:06:20 --> 00:06:25
Don't look so surprised.I'm a lovely person.

115
00:06:25 --> 00:06:26
This is so cute!

116
00:06:27 --> 00:06:28
I got that for him!

117
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
"My Mommies Love Me."

118
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
That's clever.

119
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
Oh, hi, Jul...

120
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
Hi, Jew!

121
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
Okay, sure.

122
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
That'd be great.See you then. Bye.

123
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?

124
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Yes, I did.

125
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

126
00:06:59 --> 00:07:03
Yeah, he likes it.Reaffirms his faith.

127
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
Ben, dinner!

128
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

129
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
Did you microwave that?You can't do that to breast milk.

130
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
I think I knowhow to heat breast milk.

131
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
What did you just do?

132
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
I licked my arm, what?

133
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
It's breast milk!

134
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
So?

135
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
Phoebe, that is juicesqueezed from a person.

136
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
What is the big deal?

137
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
What did you just do?

138
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
Can people stopdrinking the breast milk?

139
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
You won't even taste it?

140
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
Not even if you justpretend it's milk?

141
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
Not even if Carol's breast hada picture of a missing child on it.

142
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
- Where is everybody?- At the park. Where have you been?

143
00:07:56 --> 00:07:57
Just out.

144
00:07:57 --> 00:08:01
Had some lunch. Just me.A little quality time with me.

145
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
- Thanks for your jacket.- No problem.

146
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
You can borrow it, by the way.

147
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
Here are your keys, honey.

148
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
If you were at lunch alone,how come it cost you $53?

149
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
You know what probably happened?

150
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
Someone stole my credit card.

151
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
And put the receiptback in your pocket?

152
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
That is an excellent,excellent question.

153
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
That is excellent.

154
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
What's with you?Who did you have lunch with?

155
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
- Judy.- Who?

156
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
- Julie.- What?

157
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
Jody.

158
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
You were with Julie?

159
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
When it started, I was justtrying to be nice to her...

160
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
...because she wasmy brother's girlfriend.

161
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
And then one thingled to another...

162
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
...and before I knew it, we were...

163
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
...shopping.

164
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
Oh, my God!

165
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
Wait, we only did it once.

166
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
It meant nothing to me!

167
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
Really, I was thinkingof you the whole time.

168
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
Look, I'm sorry, all right?I never meant for you to find out.

169
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
Oh, please! Please!You wanted to get caught!

170
00:09:16 --> 00:09:17
That is not true!

171
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
So you just happenedto leave it in here?

172
00:09:20 --> 00:09:25
Did it ever occur to youthat I might just be that stupid?

173
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
Okay, I just have to know one thing.

174
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
Did you go to Bloomingdale's?

175
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
Okay, I just really needto not be with you right now.

176
00:09:54 --> 00:09:55
Hi, who's this?

177
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?It's Monica.

178
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

179
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
Joanne, it's notas simple as all that.

180
00:10:04 --> 00:10:08
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.Hi, Steve.

181
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
How did we do?

182
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
I tasted Ben's milkand Ross freaked out.

183
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
I did not freak out.

184
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
- Why'd you freak out?- Because it's breast milk.

185
00:10:20 --> 00:10:21
It's gross!

186
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
My breast milk is gross?

187
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
This should be fun.

188
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
There's nothing wrong with it.

189
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
I just don't thinkbreast milk is for adults.

190
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36
Of course, the packaging doesappeal to grownups and kids.

191
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
Don't be silly. I've tried it.It's no big deal.

192
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
Just taste it.

193
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
That would be no.

194
00:10:43 --> 00:10:44
- Come on.- Try it.

195
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
It's natural.

196
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
It doesn't taste bad.

197
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.Sort of like...

198
00:10:49 --> 00:10:49
Like what?

199
00:10:50 --> 00:10:50
Cantaloupe juice.

200
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Exactly.

201
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
You've tasted it.

202
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
You've tasted it.

203
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
Oh, you've tasted it.

204
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
You can keep saying it,but it won't stop being true.

205
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
Give me the bottle.

206
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
Get me the towel.

207
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
Howdy.

208
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
Give me a bo x of juice.

209
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

210
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
Maybe it's because ofthe way you're dressed.

211
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
Or this guy's doing so goodthey want to put more people on it.

212
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
This guy goes throughtwo bottles a day now.

213
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
What do you care?

214
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
You're an actor.This is your day job. It's nothing!

215
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
I know, but I was the best.

216
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
You know? I liked being the best.

217
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
Maybe I should getout of the game.

218
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
They need guys up in housewaresto serve cheese.

219
00:12:18 --> 00:12:19
Say you do that.

220
00:12:19 --> 00:12:24
Sooner or later, somebody will comealong that slices a better cheddar.

221
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
Then where you gonna run?

222
00:12:26 --> 00:12:26
You're right.

223
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
I say you show him what you're made of.Stand your ground.

224
00:12:29 --> 00:12:34
Show him that you're the baddestHombre west of the lingerie!

225
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
- I'm gonna do it!- All right!

226
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
Now, go see Miss Kitty andshe'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

227
00:12:41 --> 00:12:42
I don't know what to say.

228
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
That's good because I'm not listening.

229
00:12:45 --> 00:12:46
I feel terrible. I really do.

230
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
I'm sorry.Did my back hurt your knife?

231
00:12:51 --> 00:12:55
Say that I'm friends with her.Is that so terrible?

232
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
- It's that terrible?- You don't get it!

233
00:12:57 --> 00:12:58
It's bad enoughshe stole the guy...

234
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
...who may be the personI'm supposed to be with.

235
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
But now...

236
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
...she's actually...

237
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
But now she's actually stealing you!

238
00:13:10 --> 00:13:11
What are you talking about?

239
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
Nobody could steal me from you.

240
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
Because I'm friends with her doesn'tmake me any less friends with you.

241
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
You're my...

242
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
And we're...

243
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
- Oh, I love you!- I love you too!

244
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
You guys, I know that this reallydoesn't have anything to do with me.

245
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
But I love you guys too!

246
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
I really needed that.

247
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
I know that right now...

248
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
...you really needto hate Julie's guts.

249
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
But she didn't do anything wrong.

250
00:13:50 --> 00:13:54
She's just a girl who met a guy,and now they go out.

251
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
I think that if you gave hera chance, you'd like her.

252
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
Will you give it a chance?

253
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
For me?

254
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
I'd do anything for you,you know that.

255
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
I'd do anything for you!

256
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
Wait, wait, wait!

257
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
Mornin'.

258
00:14:27 --> 00:14:31
I said, mornin'!

259
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
I heard you.

260
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
All right, everybody.I'm opening the doors.

261
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
You boys ready?

262
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
Ready.

263
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
Yeah, I'm ready.

264
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

265
00:15:23 --> 00:15:24
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

266
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
Oh, my God! Todd!What the hell did you do?

267
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
Sorry. I'm such a doofus!

268
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

269
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
My God, what happened?

270
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
These new kids, they never last.

271
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
Sooner or later they all...

272
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
...stop lasting.

273
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
What do you say I buy youthat cup of coffee now?

274
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
Sure.

275
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
I just thought we should hang out.

276
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
I mean, you know,we've never really talked.

277
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
I guess you'd know that,being one of the two of us.

278
00:16:08 --> 00:16:09
I know.

279
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
I probably shouldn'teven tell you this...

280
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
...but I'm pretty muchtotally intimidated by you.

281
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
Really?

282
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
Me?

283
00:16:18 --> 00:16:19
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

284
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Ross is so crazy about you...

285
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
...and I really wanted youto like me, and I...

286
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
It's probably me justbeing totally paranoid...

287
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
...but I kind of got the feelingthat maybe you don't.

288
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
Well, you're not totally paranoid.

289
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
When you and Rossfirst started going out...

290
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
...it was really hard for me...

291
00:16:54 --> 00:16:59
...for many reasons of whichI'm not gonna bore you with now.

292
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
I see how happy he isand how good you guys are together.

293
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
And Monica's alwayssaying how nice you are...

294
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
...and God, I hate it when she's right!

295
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
Thanks.

296
00:17:15 --> 00:17:18
Would you like to go toa movie sometime or something?

297
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
Yeah, that'd be great.I'd love it.

298
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
I'd love it too.

299
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
Shoot, I gotta go.

300
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
- So I'll talk to you later.- All right, Julie.

301
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
What a manipulative bitch.

302
00:18:01 --> 00:18:02
It's not bad.
