1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
I know you can't stand to see me.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:10
over the phone...

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
your girlfriend...

4
00:00:21 --> 00:00:21
Stop calling!

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
This is 92.3 WXRK, K-Rock...

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
daily challenge!

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
All right!

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
What is the name of...

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
and would do anything...

10
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
The One with Chandler In a Box

11
00:01:12 --> 00:01:13
Oh, turkey!

12
00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
Giving thanks!

13
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
Look, everyone.It's the spirit of Thanksgiving!

14
00:01:19 --> 00:01:20
Are things with Joey better?

15
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
They couldn't be worse.I spent eight hours calling him...

16
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
...trying to get himto talk to me.

17
00:01:26 --> 00:01:27
Eight hours.

18
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
You could probably usea plug-in telephone headset.

19
00:01:30 --> 00:01:35
Should we all expect Christmas giftsthat are stolen from your office?

20
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
You shouldn't.

21
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
Speaking of Christmas...

22
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
Since Monica and I are startinga new business and have no money...

23
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
...this year we could do Secret Santaand each only buy one gift.

24
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
And there's the added mysteryof who gets who.

25
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
Who gets "whom".

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
I don't know why I do that.

27
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
I'm going to take a nap.Turkey makes me sleepy.

28
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
We haven't eaten yet.

29
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
I know, but all that workyou're doing to get it ready and...

30
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
Did you pick Rachel for yourSecret Santa? I'll trade for her.

31
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
I picked her.Thank God, you want her!

32
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Why do you want to getrid of her so badly?

33
00:02:16 --> 00:02:17
She exchanges every gift she gets.

34
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
It's impossible to get hersomething she likes.

35
00:02:20 --> 00:02:21
Come on, let's trade!

36
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
I got her that backpackand she loved it.

37
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
I remember she criedwhen that big dog ran off with...

38
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
There was no big dog.

39
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
This sucks! I already got hera briefcase with "R.G." put on it.

40
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
Her initials.

41
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
You can give it to somebody else.Like Ross Geller!

42
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
You know what?It's a girlie briefcase.

43
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
Who cares!He works in a museum.

44
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
The big game's about to start!

45
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
Ross and Joey aren't here.You can watch the parade.

46
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
What is wrong with this freezer?

47
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
- What happened?- Ice just got in my eye!

48
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
People are tryingto sleep in here!

49
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
Monica got ice in her eyeand it hurts!

50
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
- Open it up. Let me see.- I can't. It really kills.

51
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
Maybe you should putsome ice on it.

52
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
- It looks bad.- We should take you to a doctor.

53
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
No, my eye doctor is Richard!

54
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
I can't go to himwhen I don't have a boyfriend.

55
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
He's really picky about his patients.

56
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
You've got to go.What's his office number?

57
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
Like I remember his office number!

58
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
Speed dial seven.

59
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
I'm calling on behalfof Monica Geller's eye.

60
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
Is Richard Burke in today?

61
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
He's not in. Will shesee the on-call doctor?

62
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
She's very excited about that!

63
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
It's so cool.Till Monica gets back, I'm head chef.

64
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
And I get to make all the decisions.

65
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
She told you to followthe recipe exactly.

66
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
Get out of my kitchen.

67
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
I think I'm makingsome progress with Joey.

68
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
When I walked in,he went to his bedroom...

69
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
...but he only slammed the door once.

70
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
Yeah, he gave me the fingerwhile doing it.

71
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
I've got to call my mom andask her a left-handed cooking question.

72
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
I picked Monica for Secret Santa, butI'm getting her something for Hanukkah.

73
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
You want to switch?

74
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
I was trying to trade...

75
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
...for you.

76
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
Really? That's so nice.What are you getting me?

77
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
I don't know, R.G. I was thinkingsomething girlie for your office.

78
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.

79
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
Then you'll get stuck with Rachel,and she exchanges every gift.

80
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
No, I got her lots of stuffshe never took back.

81
00:04:34 --> 00:04:35
Like?

82
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
Like that gold necklaceI got her last year.

83
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
When did she wear it last?

84
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
She wore it all Christmas dayand then...

85
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
Big dog?

86
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
What are you doing?

87
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
Sending back this stuffChandler bought.

88
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
Even the TV?

89
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
No, I'll put that in my room.

90
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
Listen, Joey.I know what he did was wrong.

91
00:05:01 --> 00:05:02
But can't you hear him out?

92
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
If Chandler had kissed Rachel,would you hear him out?

93
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
That's a good point.

94
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
How long you going to punish him?

95
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
Five years.

96
00:05:13 --> 00:05:13
You've sentenced him?

97
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
Don't do the crimeif you can't do the time.

98
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
The guy's your best friend.

99
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
Was my best friend.

100
00:05:20 --> 00:05:21
I don't know whyyou're pushing for him.

101
00:05:21 --> 00:05:26
With him out of the way asmy best friend, there's a spot open.

102
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
Who, me?

103
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
I'm honored. You know whatI'm going to do as your best friend?

104
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
I'm going to get youto talk to Chandler.

105
00:05:36 --> 00:05:37
All right.

106
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
But if you weren'tmy best friend...

107
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?

108
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
I walk in the room,and he won't talk to me.

109
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
He just mumbles something in Italian.

110
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
And I know he only knowsthe bad words.

111
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
Gunther, have you seen Chandler?

112
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
I thought you were Chandler.

113
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
But one of you is over there.

114
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
Hey, Joe.

115
00:06:17 --> 00:06:18
I'll be right with you.

116
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
Thanks for coming in.

117
00:06:20 --> 00:06:24
Oh, my God!How cute is the on-call doctor?

118
00:06:24 --> 00:06:29
So cute that I'm thinkingabout jamming this pen in my eye.

119
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
Dr. Burke will see you now.

120
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Not Dr. Burke.The on-call doctor will see me now.

121
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

122
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,will see you now.

123
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
Ready?

124
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
Hey, I'm sorry. That...

125
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
- Where you going?- My folks'.

126
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
When you coming back?

127
00:06:54 --> 00:06:59
I don't know. I might stay therewhile I look for an apartment.

128
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
I thought we could talkabout this. Work it out.

129
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Seeing you two together, I don't...

130
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
What do you want me to say?Should I stop seeing her?

131
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
It's not about her. Okay?

132
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
But seeing you togetherreminds me of what you did.

133
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
I won't live with someone whodoesn't know what it is to be a friend.

134
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
I know what it is to be a friend.I screwed up.

135
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Yeah, you did.

136
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
And that's why I'm leaving.

137
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
If you're not going to stay for me,then at least stay for them.

138
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
They had a very difficult year.What with the robbery and all.

139
00:07:33 --> 00:07:34
When that guy was robbing us...

140
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
...and I was locked in theentertainment unit for six hours...

141
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
...do you know what I was doing?

142
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
I was thinking abouthow I let you down.

143
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
If I knew what kind of friendyou'd be, I wouldn't have worried.

144
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
Wait one second! There hasto be something that I can do.

145
00:07:50 --> 00:07:51
If we still had that unit...

146
00:07:51 --> 00:07:56
...I'd get in it for six hoursand think about how I let you down.

147
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
We got a box.

148
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
I remember the last time I saw you.

149
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
It was the morning I left for college.

150
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
You were standingoutside the Dairy Queen.

151
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
Just probably waiting for it to open.

152
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
You look great now.

153
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
You look great too.

154
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
You're an excellent patient.

155
00:08:20 --> 00:08:21
How does it look?

156
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
You have a scratch on your cornea.You have to wear a patch.

157
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
Like a pirate?

158
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
If that helps you.

159
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
How long have you been workingwith your dad?

160
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

161
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
I moved back here a couple months ago.

162
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
Big family dinner tonight?

163
00:08:43 --> 00:08:44
No way!

164
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
I was going to have Thanksgivingat my girlfriend's.

165
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
But we broke up.

166
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
She wasn't readyfor a serious commitment.

167
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
So you made her walk the plank,aye, matey?

168
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
You're not wearing the patch yet.

169
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
I know.

170
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
He's coming here for Thanksgiving?

171
00:09:09 --> 00:09:10
I know. It's sick.

172
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
Why is it sick?

173
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
It's Richard's son!

174
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
It's like invitinga Greek tragedy over for dinner.

175
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

176
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
I could see where I'd beyour best shot, but no.

177
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
Sorry, honey. I think it's twisted.

178
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
What's twisted?

179
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Me going out with Richard's son.

180
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
It sounds like a really bad idea.

181
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
Is he okay in there?

182
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
He's fine!

183
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
If things work outbetween you and Richard's son...

184
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
...you can tell your kids...

185
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
...that you sleptwith their grandfather.

186
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
Judge all you want to.

187
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
Married a lesbian,left a man at the altar...

188
00:09:49 --> 00:09:50
...fell in love with a gay ice dancer...

189
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
...threw a girl's wooden legin the fire. Live in a box!

190
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
What exactly is the point of the box?

191
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
The meaning of the box is threefold.

192
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
One, it gives me the timeto think about what I did.

193
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
Two, it proves how much I careabout my friendship with Joey.

194
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
And three...

195
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
...it hurts.

196
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
Remember that necklaceI gave you last year?

197
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
Can I see it?

198
00:10:24 --> 00:10:25
Why?

199
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
I just want to check something.

200
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
Now we'll see.

201
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36
Air hole! Air hole!

202
00:10:36 --> 00:10:40
Here it is. I love it.I wear it all the time.

203
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
The necklace I got you was gold.This is silver.

204
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
Well, maybe...

205
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
...it changed.

206
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Oh, my God!You actually exchanged it.

207
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
Isn't it better to exchange itfor something I enjoy...

208
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
...and can use a lot?

209
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
What did you get?

210
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
Credit.

211
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
I'll get it. I'll get it.

212
00:11:07 --> 00:11:08
Hi, Tim.

213
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
Thank you.Come meet my friends.

214
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
Phoebe.

215
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
And Joey.

216
00:11:15 --> 00:11:16
My brother, Ross.

217
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
And Rachel.

218
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
That's Chandler.

219
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
How do you do?

220
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
- What's...- Well, he's...

221
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
He's doing some thinking.

222
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
- What happened?- You kissed my girlfriend!

223
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
I like those sunglasses.

224
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
"Like them" like them? Or "I'd liketo get store credit" like them?

225
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
This turkey is ready.

226
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Where can I wash up?

227
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
Let me show you.

228
00:11:55 --> 00:11:56
The towels are hanging nextto the sink.

229
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
And you can use the fancy soap.

230
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
Fancy soap? I thought we weresaving that for the Pope.

231
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
See. He's nice, right?

232
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
Do you want a relationshipwhere you can actually say:

233
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
"That's not how your dadused to do it?"

234
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
Everything looks great.Where should I sit?

235
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
Saved you a seat.

236
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
Sick, sick, sick.

237
00:12:21 --> 00:12:22
I'll get it.

238
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
Got you!

239
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
That doesn't soundlike thinking to me.

240
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
Sorry!

241
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
You shouldn't be talking.

242
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
You've got too much thinking to doto be talking and joking.

243
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
Okay, you got it!

244
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Ross, pass me the yams?

245
00:12:37 --> 00:12:42
Joey's got the mashed potatoesif you want to exchange them.

246
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
Stop!What's the matter with you?

247
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
We've got company.

248
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
Nothing's the matter with me.

249
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.I have feelings.

250
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
Okay, fine.

251
00:13:00 --> 00:13:05
You can't tell, but I'm breakingthe tension by mooning you guys.

252
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
All right, look!

253
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
If this is a big joke to you,forget about it.

254
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
This means something to me.

255
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
If it doesn't mean anything to you,then get out of there.

256
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
Otherwise, you're justan idiot in a box.

257
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
You're right. I'm sorry.This means a lot to me.

258
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
I want to be friends again.I swear I won't say another word.

259
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
- So you'll take this seriously?- Absolutely!

260
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
That sounds like another word to me.

261
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
Are you going to take this seriously?

262
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
Okay!

263
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
Don't say that I have no sentiment.

264
00:13:42 --> 00:13:44
This is a movie stubfrom our first date.

265
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
This eggshell is from the first timeyou made me breakfast in bed.

266
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
This is from the museum,the first time we...

267
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
...were together.

268
00:13:53 --> 00:13:58
Maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,but I keep the things that matter.

269
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
I don't know what to say.I'm sorry.

270
00:14:01 --> 00:14:05
Though you're notsupposed to take these.

271
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
It's like a million years old.

272
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
We actually have peoplelooking for that.

273
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
This always happens.

274
00:14:18 --> 00:14:19
Here, let me.

275
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
Thank you.

276
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
You have very beautiful...

277
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
...eye.

278
00:14:29 --> 00:14:30
My friends think this is weird.

279
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
I thought so too. I almostcanceled, but it really isn't.

280
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
I know. Me and your dad,that's totally separate.

281
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
I totally agree.

282
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
We're two peoplewho find each other...

283
00:14:42 --> 00:14:43
...very attractive.

284
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
Right?

285
00:14:53 --> 00:14:54
What?

286
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
Nothing, nothing.

287
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
No, really.Was that not okay?

288
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
No, that was good.

289
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
That was a good kiss.

290
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
It reminded you of...

291
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
Don't say it!

292
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
- It did, didn't it?- Yes!

293
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
I know!

294
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
I want you to know how sorry I am...

295
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
Chandler's the one I'm mad at.

296
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
Well, I'm still sorry.

297
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
Is he here?

298
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
In the box.

299
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
He can't talk right now.

300
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47
What's going on?

301
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
He's trying to show Joeyhow much he means to him.

302
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
By being in a box?

303
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
Joey had reasons.

304
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
They were threefold.

305
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
You not being able to talkmight make this easier.

306
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
Listen...

307
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
I don't want to be someonewho comes between two best friends.

308
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
I can't stand seeingwhat this is doing to you guys.

309
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
And I don't want to bethe cause of that.

310
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
I don't think we can seeeach other anymore.

311
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
I'm going to my mom's in Chicago.

312
00:16:29 --> 00:16:33
I'm going to stay there for a while.

313
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
I think this could have beensomething really amazing.

314
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
But, you know, this isprobably for the best.

315
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
You know?

316
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
I'm going to miss you.

317
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
Goodbye, Chandler.

318
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
Open the box!

319
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
He can still catch her.Get out of there!

320
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
We're going to be fine.Get out!

321
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
You did some real goodthinking in there.

322
00:17:17 --> 00:17:18
I mean, this is...

323
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
You could still catch her!

324
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
And Merry Christmasfrom your Secret Santa!

325
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
All right, who got Chandler?Because I need to trade.

326
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
He sees her!

327
00:17:37 --> 00:17:40
He's catching up to her.

328
00:17:40 --> 00:17:41
She sees him!

329
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
They're hugging!

330
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
He's taking her purse.

331
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
That's not them.

332
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
I'll go call the police.

333
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
There they are!

334
00:17:59 --> 00:18:02
All right, get a room.
