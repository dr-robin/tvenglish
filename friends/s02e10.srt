00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
Slow down! The paper won't besold out at 1:00 in the morning.

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
I'm excited!I've never been reviewed before!

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
You were so amazing as the king!I'm really impressed.

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
But you know what?

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
You might wanna wearunderwear next time.

00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
When you sat on the throne,you could see your...

00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
...royal subjects.

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
Here it is! Here it is!

"The only thing worse thanthe mindless adolescent direction...

12
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbinglyunskilled portrayal of the king."

13
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Okay, look.That is one guy's opinion.

14
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
All right?Pheebs, read yours.

15
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
"The only thing worse thanthe mindless, adolescent direction..."

16
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
Anybody have a different paper?

17
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
Ross, read yours.

18
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
I don't want to.

19
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
Joey, they don't knowwhat they're talking about.

20
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
Maybe they do.

21
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53
I've done this 10 years and I'mnowhere. There's gotta be a reason.

22
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
Come on, you're justpaying your dues.

23
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
No, no, no. It's too hard.

24
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
It's not worth it. I quit.

25
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
Come on, Joey!

26
00:01:00 --> 00:01:01
Wait, wait one minute.Wait a minute.

27
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
I believe this will change your mind.

00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
I used to want to be a vet.

34
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
Then I found out you haveto put your hands into cows.

35
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
Are you okay?

36
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
Just a tough day at work, you know?

37
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.

38
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
I know this jacket.This is Fun Bobby's jacket!

39
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
Where is he?He's here, isn't he?

40
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
- Maybe.- Don't toy with me.

41
00:02:12 --> 00:02:12
Geller!

42
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
Hey, Fun Bobby!

43
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
Hey! You been working out?

44
00:02:16 --> 00:02:16
Not at all.

45
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
I love this guy!

46
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
I'm psyched to hearyou're back with Monica.

47
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
- You and me both!- So what'd I miss?

48
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
We were tryingto make Joey feel better.

49
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
Need me to pick you up?

50
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
No, I'm all right, man.

51
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
No, I'm picking you up!

52
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
No, seriously.I don't need you to...

53
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
It still works!

54
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
Before I go, does anybody elseneed to be picked up?

55
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
I'm still gonna go.

56
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
See you later, babe.

57
00:02:43 --> 00:02:47
Public display of affection coming up.You can avert your eyes.

58
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
See you.

59
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Fun Bobby is so great.

60
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
Oh, isn't he?

61
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
I think this time it may work with him.He makes me feel so good.

62
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
I've been feeling so lousy lately.No job, no boyfriend.

63
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
Well, at least my cup is half full.

64
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
Half full of love!

65
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
For our two-week anniversary,he's taking me to his cousin's cabin.

66
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
Cabin of love!

67
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
We went througha lot of wine tonight.

68
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
I only had two glasses.

69
00:03:19 --> 00:03:20
I had a glass.

70
00:03:20 --> 00:03:20
Two.

71
00:03:21 --> 00:03:21
I had one glass.

72
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
I had a mug full in this...

73
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
...I-got-boned-at-the-Museum-of-Natural-History mug.

74
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Okay, so that's what?Two bottles.

75
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
And yet somehow we went through five?

76
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
So what?So he drank a lot tonight.

77
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
Now that I think about it,I don't think...

78
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
...I've ever seen Fun Bobbywithout a drink.

79
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
And did you notice howhe always starts his stories with...

80
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
..."Okay, I was so wasted!"or "Oh, we were so bombed!"

81
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
"So I wake up and I'm inthis dumpster in Connecticut!"

82
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Have you been with himwhen he wasn't drinking?

83
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
We just happen to go to a lotof places where you might drink.

84
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
How do you go to a wine-tastingwithout having a drink?

85
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
Or to a club, or to the...

86
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
...zoo.

87
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

88
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
I don't know, taste it.

89
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
Too late, you already had some.

90
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
What do you saywe make these coffees Irish?

91
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Cake!

92
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

93
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
It seems like you've been makingan awful lot of stuff "Irish" lately.

94
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
I'd make them Belgian, but the wafflesare hard to get into that flask.

95
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
Yeah, okay.

96
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
Maybe it's none of my business.Or maybe it is, I don't know.

97
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
I'm worried about you.

98
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
This isn't the first time somebodysaid something to me about this.

99
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
But I always made excuses,like "I'm just a social drinker."

100
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
Or "Come on, it's Flag Day!"

101
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
So, what are you saying now?

102
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
I guess I'm saying...

103
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
...I'll try and quit.

104
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
I like that you worry about me.

105
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
So, what's going on?

106
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
I am gonna try and quit drinking.

107
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
Oh! Why?

108
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
Guess who's back in show biz!

109
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
Lorne Greene?

110
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
No. You know why?Because he's dead.

111
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Oh, no.

112
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
This is gonna seem bittersweet now...

113
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
...but Joey, that's who!

114
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
My agent called with an auditionfor "Days Of Our Lives"!

115
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
Kick ass!

116
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
We have to celebrate!We should do a soap opera theme.

117
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
We could all sleep together,then one of us could get amnesia!

118
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
When do you get off?We'll do something tonight.

119
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
Well, actually, I'm already done.But I kind of got plans.

120
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
You have other friends?

121
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
I have a date.

122
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
What?

123
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
With a man?

124
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
What's so strangeabout me having a date?

125
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
What about Ross?

126
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
You're still madbecause he made that list?

127
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

128
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
I'm not really "anything"at him anymore.

129
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
- What are you talking about?- I don't know.

130
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
Whatever I was feeling, I'm...

131
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
...not.

132
00:06:25 --> 00:06:26
But you guys came so close.

133
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
I'm sorry. You'll haveto get used to the fact...

134
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
...that I will not be dating Ross.

135
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Here he is.

136
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
Guys, this is Russ.

137
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
I'm not saying you're not talented.You're very talented.

138
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
But with the bird dead and all,there's very little act left.

139
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
Honey, give me a break, will you?

140
00:06:56 --> 00:06:57
I'll talk to you later.

141
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
There's my favorite client!

142
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
So tell me, darling,how was the audition?

143
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
I think it went well.I got a callback for Thursday.

144
00:07:04 --> 00:07:08
Joey! Have you everseen me ecstatic?

145
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
Well, here it is.

146
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
Okay! Listen, there's somethingI want to talk to you about.

147
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
The casting lady...

148
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

149
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
She's great.

150
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
But I kind of got the feeling thatshe was sort of coming on to me.

151
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
And I definitely would get the partif I were to, you know...

152
00:07:31 --> 00:07:35
If I sent the little general in.

153
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
I see! Well, I'm just gonnaput in a call here...

154
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
...and we'll find out what's going onand straighten it out.

155
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
Lori, please.

156
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
Hi, darling!

157
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
How about Joey Tribbianifor the part of the cab driver?

158
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
Isn't he terrific?

159
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

160
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
You're gonna have to sleep with her.

161
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
- What's the matter?- Fun Bobby.

162
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
What? Isn't he sober?

163
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
Oh, he's sober all right.

164
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
Turns out that Fun Bobbywas fun for a reason.

165
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
All right, here you go, sweetie.

166
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
Thanks. You wannahear something funny?

167
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
Oh, God, yes!

168
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
There are no hardware stores openpast midnight in the Village.

169
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
That is funny.

170
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
I needed to buy a hammer and I'm outwalking around the neighborhood.

171
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
But apparently...

172
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
...there are no hardware stores openpast midnight in the Village.

173
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
Don't you have tobe at your interview?

174
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
Oh, yeah.

175
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
See you guys.

176
00:08:47 --> 00:08:48
Bye...

177
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
...ridiculously dull Bobby.

178
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
Oh, my God.

179
00:08:52 --> 00:08:53
He's not that bad.

180
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
Not that bad?Did you not hear the hammer story?

181
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
Okay, don't get all squinky.

182
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
Maybe it's the kind of storywhere you had to be there.

183
00:09:02 --> 00:09:03
But I'm gonna be there!

184
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
For the rest of my life.

185
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
I can't dump him. I made himquit drinking. I made him dull!

186
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
Don't say that.

187
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
He's probably always been dull.You just, you know...

188
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
...set it free.

189
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
Hey, Ross.

190
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
Hi, Russ.

191
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
I've got two more tablesto clean, and then we'll go.

192
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
I'll just sit here and...

193
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
...chat with your...

194
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
...friend-type people.

195
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
Rachel?

196
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
So, you know whatyou're doing, right?

197
00:09:39 --> 00:09:40

198
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
Well, yeah. But, no.I mean...

199
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
Doesn't Russ justremind you of someone?

200
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
Bob Saget?

201
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
Oh, yeah!

202
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
No, no, no!

203
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
Oh, my, oh!

204
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
What's wrong?

205
00:09:56 --> 00:09:57
She's upset because...

206
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
...she buttered a spiderinto her toast this morning.

207
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
All right.

208
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
Listen, Pheebs.This is gonna be okay.

209
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
Ross, Russ.Russ, Ross.

210
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

211
00:10:13 --> 00:10:14
Yes. Yes, I am.

212
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

213
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
Actually, I'm kind of a...

214
00:10:19 --> 00:10:20
...you know...

215
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
...a date-type thing...

216
00:10:23 --> 00:10:24
...of Rachel's.

217
00:10:24 --> 00:10:25
A date?

218
00:10:26 --> 00:10:27
I'm her date.

219
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
Oh! Oh, you're a...

220
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
Oh, you're the date.

221
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
This is actually good...

222
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
...because if we lose Ross,we have a spare.

223
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
Oh! You are the paleontologist.

224
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
Yes. Yes, I am.And you are a...

225
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
Periodontist.

226
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
See? Now they're asdifferent as night and...

227
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
...later that night.

228
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
Well, I am going to get a beverage.

229
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
It was nice meeting you.

230
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
Ditto.

231
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
Well, I met Russ.

232
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
Hey, I didn't knowwe were seeing other people.

233
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
Well, we're notseeing each other, so...

234
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
For your information,there's a woman at the museum...

235
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
...who's curator of moths and other...

236
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
...winged things...

237
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
...who's let it be known thatshe is drawn to me, much like a...

238
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
...you know.

239
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
I've kept her at bay,but if this is the deal...

240
00:11:23 --> 00:11:24
This is the deal.

241
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Okay, well, have a nice evening.

242
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
Russ, you ready?

243
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
She's dating?

244
00:11:35 --> 00:11:36
She's dating?

245
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
Yes, but did you seewho she was dating?

246
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
What do you mean?

247
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
- Do you not see it?- See what?

248
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
I don't know what she seesin that goober!

249
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
It takes him, what?Like, I don't know...

250
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
...hello, a weekto get out a sentence?

251
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
It's annoying, isn't it?

252
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
You didn't get the part...

253
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
...or Italy calledand said it was hungry?

254
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
The part's mine if I want it.

255
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
Oh, my God!

256
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
If I'm willing to sleepwith the casting lady.

257
00:12:15 --> 00:12:16
Oh, my...

258
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
...God?

259
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
Ten years I've been waitingfor a break like this. Ten years!

260
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
I mean, "Days of our Lives".That's actually on television!

261
00:12:25 --> 00:12:26
What are you gonna do?

262
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
I guess I could sleep with her.I mean...

263
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
How can I do that?

264
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
I've got a pop-up book that told meeverything I need to know.

265
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
I've never sleptwith someone for a part.

266
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
Well, is she...

267
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
Sorry.

268
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
Is she good-looking?

269
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
She's totally good-looking.If I met her in a bar...

270
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
...I'd be buying her breakfast.

271
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
After having slept with her.

272
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Maybe this isn't such a big deal.

273
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
The way that I see it is, you get agreat job, and you get to have sex!

274
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
Throw in a tree and a fat guy,and you've got Christmas!

275
00:13:06 --> 00:13:09
I just don't think thatI want it that way, though.

276
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
I mean, let's sayI do make it, all right?

277
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
I'll always look back and wonderif it was because of my talent or...

278
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
...you know, the little general.

279
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
Didn't you used to call it"the little major"?

280
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
After Denise DeMarco,I had to promote it.

281
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
Something from the bar?

282
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
Yes, I would like something.

283
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
No. No, thank you.

284
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
If you wanna drink, it's okay with me.I've gotta get used to it.

285
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
No, no, really.I wouldn't feel right about it.

286
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
Just some water, please.

287
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
- So my refrigerator light's out.- Scotch on the rocks with a twist!

288
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
We're having some fun now, huh, Ross?

289
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
Wanna do another one?Huh, Russ?

290
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
Eleven letters...

291
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
...atomic element number 101,ends in "ium".

292
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
Dysprosium.

293
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
Dysprosium.

294
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
Try mendelevium.

295
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
And weenie number two has it.

296
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
Unless "Knights in White Satin"was sung by the Doody Blues.

297
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
You don't see it?You actually don't see it?

298
00:14:12 --> 00:14:12
What?

299
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
Honey, you're dating Ross.

300
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

301
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

302
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
Steve, sleeve.

303
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
No one is named sleeve.

304
00:14:22 --> 00:14:23
What are you talking about?

305
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
Other than their names being similar,I do not see what you're seeing.

306
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
For your information...

307
00:14:29 --> 00:14:30
...it's a card sharp,not a card shark.

308
00:14:31 --> 00:14:32
You could not be more wrong.

309
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
You could try,but you would not be successful.

310
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
I'm gonna get some more coffee beforethe pinching and eye-poking begins.

311
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
I know your problem.

312
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
Oh, you do, do you?

313
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
You're jealous.

314
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
Of what?

315
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
You're jealousbecause I'm a real doctor.

316
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

317
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
That's the smallest body partyou can major in.

318
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
Day one, floss.Day two, here's your diploma.

319
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
You listen here...

320
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
- Let me finish.- No, let me finish.

321
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
No, you let me fin...

322
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
Did Joey say what he was gonna do?

323
00:15:15 --> 00:15:16
I don't even think he knew.

324
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
Would you sleep with somebodyto get a great job?

325
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
Who would I have to sleep with?

326
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
Me.

327
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
Why with you?

328
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
It's my game.You want the job or not?

329
00:15:30 --> 00:15:31
Good morning.

330
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
Where you going?

331
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
Bobby and I are going awayfor the weekend. Remember?

332
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
What's with all the liquor?

333
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
What's going on?Is Bobby drinking again?

334
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
This is not for him.This is for me.

335
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
That way, he's sober but hisshoelace stories are more amusing.

336
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
God! Even his knock is boring!

337
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
- I'll be ready in a second.- Could I talk to you?

338
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
Sure.

339
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
This is hard for me to say.

340
00:16:00 --> 00:16:01
You fell off the wagon!

341
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
Oh, no, no.

342
00:16:03 --> 00:16:04
It's about you.

343
00:16:04 --> 00:16:05
What about me?

344
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
I think you may havea drinking problem.

345
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
What, these?

346
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

347
00:16:15 --> 00:16:19
Look, I'm not strong enough to bein a codependent relationship.

348
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Oh, shoot.

349
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
Well, anyway,I hope we can be friends.

350
00:16:28 --> 00:16:29
Take care.

351
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
- You too.- Goodbye.

352
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
What happened?

353
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
We kind of broke up.

354
00:16:43 --> 00:16:44
Does anybody want these?

355
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
I'll take one.

356
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
Sometimes I hold stuff like thisand pretend I'm a giant.

357
00:16:54 --> 00:16:55
How'd the callback go?

358
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
It was unbelievable. I walkedin there and she was all over me.

359
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
- What did you do?- I couldn't do it.

360
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
I didn't want the part that way.

361
00:17:02 --> 00:17:02
Good for you!

362
00:17:03 --> 00:17:04
But wait!I left her office...

363
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
...and she caught up with meand offered me a bigger part.

364
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
So, and?

365
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
So, you are now looking atDr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...

366
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
...recurring inat least four episodes!

367
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
All right, I gotta go shower.

368
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
I guess you guys heardRachel dumped me.

369
00:17:34 --> 00:17:35
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

370
00:17:36 --> 00:17:37
She said I remind hertoo much of somebody.

371
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
Any idea whoshe's talking about?

372
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

373
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
She hates him.

374
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
Hey, Julie!

375
00:17:48 --> 00:17:49
How are you doing?

376
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
I don't know. It's weirdnot being with Ross...

377
00:17:52 --> 00:17:54
...but I guess I'm doing okay.

378
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
Actually, I've got someof his stuff that he...
