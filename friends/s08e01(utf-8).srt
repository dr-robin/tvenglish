1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Oh, my God, we did it.
-We just got married. Right there.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Is that your ring?

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
We're off to a good start.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You sure you're not pregnant?

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Yeah,
but if you're ready to have kids. . .

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
. . .I'll blow off this party right now.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-That ceremony was so beautiful.
-Was it perfect?

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Is it too soon to see the video?

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Can we just take a moment?
Our two best friends just got married.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
We are so blessed to be able
to share in this incredible joy.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
That is so true.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Mon, is it too late to switch from
chicken to steak?

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm so happy for you guys.
You were both so lucky.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You both said the right names.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
And nobody was drunk.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Nobody was gay.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
And on your first try!

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
The One After "I Do"

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Great.
I'll just change the film.

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I know I'm not supposed to know,
but I do and I'm so excited.

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-What's going on?
-Monica's pregnant.

22
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Is that why you had to get married?

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I'm not pregnant!
-Ah, slow swimmers?

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-You're not pregnant?
-Did you tell anybody I was?

25
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
No.
I'll be right back.

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You take a lot of pictures!

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'll just shoot Monica
and the bloody soldier.

28
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-You gotta change before the party.
-I don't have any other clothes.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Find anything that doesn't say,
"I died tragically in France. "

30
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Fine.

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
And be careful who you hug.
You got blood on my father's dress.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Let's see the bride and groom,
and the bridesmaids.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Why did you say you're not pregnant?
-'Cause I'm not.

34
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
We found your test in the trash.
If you're not pregnant. . .

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
. . .it's because I am.

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-What are you talking about?
-I am with child.

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I didn't say anything
because it's your day.

38
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
So you told people I was pregnant?

39
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Does this look like
a moment to remember?

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Who's the father?
-I can't say.

41
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Why not?
-I can't say because he's famous.

42
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Oh, my God, who is it?

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Come on, you have to tell us.

44
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Okay. It's James Brolin.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-James Brolin is the father.
-Barbra Streisand's husband?

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
What? He never said that to me.

47
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Let's get Chandler
and the bridesmaids.

48
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-How about just the bridesmaids?
-You know, I am the groom.

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Oh, my God!
-Thank you for doing that!

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-You said Monica was pregnant.
-You did, I just didn't disagree.

51
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Sneaky!

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Smile, ladies!

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-By the way, James Brolin?
-I know.

54
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I could only think of two names:
him and Ed Begley Jr.

55
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Then I remembered he's gay, so. . . .

56
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
-Really?

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Congratulations!
-You married just in time, I hear.

58
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
What? Ross!

59
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
If you've got this under control,
I'm just--

60
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,228  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I just wanted you to know
that you have given us more joy--

61
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Ma, I'm not pregnant.
-What?

62
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Not pregnant.

63
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Oh, well.

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-But I did still get married today.
-Whatever.

65
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Thank you very much. It gives me
great pleasure to introduce to you:

66
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!

67
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Before we go, I got a present.
-I won't put my hand in your pocket.

68
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
No.
I've been taking dancing lessons.

69
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I wanted this to be memorable.

70
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
That is so sweet!

71
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
So will you join me in our first dance
as husband and wife?

72
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-What is it?
-These new shoes are all slippery.

73
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Will you be able to do this?
-Not well.

74
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Good news!
I don't think anyone's looking.

75
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Are you ready to talk about it?
-No.

76
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Now?

77
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
No!

78
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Okay, we'll talk about
something else. Who's the father?

79
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I haven't told him yet, so I don't
think I should tell anybody else.

80
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
That's fair. Is it Tag?

81
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm sorry, I'll stop.
Is it Ross?

82
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Oh, my God, it's Joey!
-Stop it.

83
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm not telling you until I tell him.

84
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
At least we know it's a him.

85
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Oh, sweet Lord.
-I'm sorry, okay?

86
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
It was either this or a bathrobe.

87
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
What's more important?
My clothes, or being here today?

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm not even going to pretend
to be listening.

89
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I don't think we met.
I'm Ross, Monica's brother.

90
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Hi, I'm Mona from the restaurant.

91
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Hello, "Mona from the restaurant. "

92
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Mona. What a beautiful name.
-I always kind of hated it.

93
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Come on! Mona Lisa?

94
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Mona. . .

95
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
. . .Klegglachen?

96
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
The famous botanist.

97
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
She's-- Well, she's dead now.

98
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
But she was once
the hottie of the plant world.

99
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I never knew about her.
-Linda Klegglachen. . . .

100
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
So, what table are you at?
Me too.

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Good. There will be
someone who likes my name.

102
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Yes, there will.

103
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Guess what, Molly Gilbert. You've
just been bumped up to table one.

104
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
If it's all right with you,
I'll take your place at table six.

105
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Martin Klegglachen!

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
That's better. Bend your arms,
look straight ahead.

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
This time,
really put your ass into it.

108
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Who's slippery now?

109
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Doesn't it feel good, rubbing a fork
on the bottom of your shoe?

110
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Look, my date has arrived.
I want you to meet Dennis Phillips.

111
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-This is my son, Chandler.
-Congratulations.

112
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Dennis is a dear old friend.
And a fantastic lover.

113
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Are my ears bleeding?

114
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Chandler has always been shy.

115
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You're right. Bravo, Dennis,
thanks for pleasing my mother so.

116
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I missed the ceremony
because I was at auditions.

117
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Dennis is directing
a new Broadway show.

118
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I've admired your work for years.

119
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Thank you.
Excuse me, I'll get myself a drink.

120
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'll be back in a moment.

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Okay, stop!

122
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Dennis Phillips! How did you meet?
-It's a funny story.

123
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Funny "ha-ha," or funny--?

124
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Thank you. If you'll take your seats,
dinner will be served.

125
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I thought you were at table six.
-No. Nine.

126
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
When you showed it to me,
you held it that way. . .

127
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
. . .which was misleading.

128
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Hello.

129
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Can you see if your mom can give
my résumé to Dennis Phillips?

130
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
They've kind of locked themselves
in the men's room.

131
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Perhaps when they get out.

132
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
If I got a Broadway show,
then I would have done it all.

133
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Film, television and theater.
Not radio, but that's for ugly people.

134
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-What size shoes do you wear?
-Eleven.

135
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
My shoes are giving me a problem.
Can I borrow your boots?

136
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I don't know where I left them, so. . . .

137
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Those aren't 1 1 s.
-Okay, fine, I'm a 7!

138
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
But the rest of me is good!

139
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Who am I kidding,
I belong in radio.

140
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I can't believe Phoebe's pregnant.
-Let's not talk about that now.

141
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-This is so huge.
-Sure, but as big as your wedding?

142
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Of course not. Nothing is.

143
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
In this day and age, how dumb
do you have to be to get pregnant?

144
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Sometimes you can wear
everything you're supposed to. . .

145
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
. . .and one of those little guys
just gets through.

146
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-How?
-I don't know, maybe they have tools.

147
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
She said she's
definitely having the baby.

148
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
She's gonna raise it on her own.

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Maybe that's really brave.

150
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I just hope she realizes
how hard it's gonna be.

151
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Maybe she hasn't really
thought it through that much.

152
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
There's a lot to think about.

153
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
How is she gonna
handle it financially?

154
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Does she realize she's not gonna
have a date for the next 1 8 years?

155
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I don't know.
-Are you okay?

156
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm just thinking
about poor, knocked-up Phoebe.

157
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Champagne?
-Thank you very much.

158
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
That's how the French drink it.

159
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Well, I just got off the phone
with my lover, James Brolin.

160
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Really?
-And he is married to some singer.

161
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
But he said he'd leave her for me.
So I said, "Are you sure?"

162
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-And he said--
-Rachel's pregnant?

163
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
What?

164
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Why bother?
-How do you feel?

165
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I don't know.

166
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I have to make all these decisions
that I don't want to make.

167
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Someone take this away from me!
-Maybe you're not pregnant.

168
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
When I got pregnant,
I took the test three times.

169
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Yes. Are you sure
you peed on the stick right?

170
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
How many ways are there?

171
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm just saying,
don't freak out until you're sure.

172
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
All right, I'll take it again
when I get home. I can wait.

173
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
This is a good party.
How late does it go till?

174
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You gotta take it now. You won't
be able to have fun until we know.

175
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Do it as a present to me.
-Okay. Thank you.

176
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I'll run out and get you one.
-You're great.

177
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Wait a minute. Who's the father?

178
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-She won't tell us.
-Come on! It could be my present.

179
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I just gave you peeing on a stick.
-This is why you register.

180
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
It was the chair again.
I'm not doing it!

181
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Dad, can't you go back to your table?

182
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Apparently, little Molly Gilbert
is enjoying her grown-up salmon.

183
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You know what. . .?

184
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Would you like to dance?
-Sure.

185
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Dr. Geller?
-I wasn't farting!

186
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
A little game from our table.

187
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

188
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Maybe later.
I'm about to dance with this lady.

189
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Unless this lady wouldn't mind
letting you go first.

190
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'd be happy to.
You are very sweet.

191
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Yes, I am.

192
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
In fact, let's try my special way.
You can dance on my feet.

193
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Hop on.

194
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Is the pretty lady looking?
Keep dancing.

195
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
And the world will never know.

196
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Did you talk to Dennis?
-I told him how talented you were.

197
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-And about Days of our Lives.
-No, you don't tell him that!

198
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-He'll think I'm just a soap actor.
-But you're not!

199
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You are a soap actor
with freakishly tiny feet.

200
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
He has no idea
what kind of range I have.

201
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Don't move.

202
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
It's like he's running on pegs.

203
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Thank you.
-No, thank you, Miranda.

204
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Melinda.
-All right.

205
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-How cute was that?
-Were you watching?

206
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Can I go next?

207
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Of course you can. Hop on.

208
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
But I get to hop on after her.

209
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I am so gonna score!
-What?

210
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I like your bow.

211
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'd like to propose a toast
to Monica and Chandler. . .

212
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
. . .the greatest couple in the world,
and my best friends.

213
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
When I first found out they were
getting married, I was a little angry.

214
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
"Why, God? How can you
take them away from me?! "

215
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
But then I thought back over our
memories together.

216
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Happy memories.

217
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
And there were some sad memories.

218
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm sorry.

219
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
And some scared memories.

220
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
And then I realized
I'll always be their friend.

221
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
A friend who can speak
in many dialects. . .

222
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
. . .has training in stage combat
and is willing to do partial nudity.

223
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
To the happy couple.

224
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-That was nice.
-Can we do it again?

225
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
No, no.

226
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-So is it my turn?
-I'm next.

227
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Okay, you can dance with her first.
-Are you sure?

228
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-What's your name?
-Gert.

229
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
That's pretty.

230
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
What are you doing, Gert?

231
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Dancing on your feet
like the other girls.

232
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Okay. Hop on, Gert.

233
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Why aren't you moving your feet?
-I'm trying.

234
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You're not going fast enough.

235
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Maybe I should stand on your feet!

236
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Did you happen to catch my toast?

237
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Was that for my benefit?
-There was something for everyone.

238
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I know you're casting for a show.
-I don't think you're right for it.

239
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You're wrong.
Whatever it is, I can do it.

240
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Try me.
-It's an all-Chinese cast.

241
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Can you be Chinese?

242
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I'm not proud of this, but. . . .
-No, please!

243
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Want to go back to the dance floor?
-Did it turn into sand?

244
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Come on, you'll be fine.
-No, I won't.

245
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Know why I took all those lessons?

246
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I didn't want you to be embarrassed
to be seen with some clumsy idiot.

247
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
You could never embarrass me.
Okay, you could easily do that.

248
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
But it doesn't matter.

249
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I married you. No matter what you do,
I'm going home with you.

250
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
So I'm gonna dance with my husband.

251
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
That's the last time I buy shoes
at the Slippery Fun shoe store.

252
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Just try not to move your feet at all.

253
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
There you go.

254
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm gonna have you arrested.
You stole my moves.

255
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-You're quite the dancer.
-Thanks, Mrs. Geller.

256
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-You can call me "Mom. "
-Really? I will.

257
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
What's the matter?

258
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Sorry, Mom.

259
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-How much longer?
-Thirty seconds.

260
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Did I miss it?

261
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Rachel, I want you to know. . .

262
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
. . .that if it's positive, we--

263
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-I know.
-You do? Okay.

264
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
It's time.

265
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
No!

266
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Go ahead, Rach.
-I can't look at it.

267
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Somebody tell me.

268
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
It's negative.

269
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-What?
-It's negative.

270
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Well, there you go.

271
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
That's really great, great news.

272
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Because the whole. . .

273
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
. . .not being ready,
the financial aspects, all that. . . .

274
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
This is just the way
it was supposed to be.

275
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Well then, great.

276
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
This is so stupid.

277
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
How can I be upset
over something I never had?

278
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-It's negative?
-No, it's positive.

279
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-What?
-It's not negative, it's positive.

280
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I lied before.

281
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-Now you know how you really feel.
-That's a risky little game.

282
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Are you really gonna do this?

283
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm gonna have a baby.

284
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I'm gonna have a baby!

285
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-With who?
-No, it's still not the time.

286
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I didn't see
the fast song coming.

287
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Don't try to talk. We'll get you
up to your room, soak your feet.

288
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
That's so sweet!

289
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
There's so few
genuinely nice guys out there.

290
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I feel like I'm holding down
the fort all alone.

291
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
-It's Joey, right?
-Yeah.

292
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
Wait a minute! I'm the nice one!

293
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
I danced with the kids all night.

294
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:410 Y2:529
How small are your feet?
