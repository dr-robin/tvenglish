00:00:03 --> 00:00:07
So, what's the big news you had usrush all the way over here for?

00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
Our news. My company has asked meto head up our office in Tulsa.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
So as of Monday,I'm being officially relocated.

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
- Oh, my God!- What? Monday?

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
- How long do you have to go for?- They said it could be up to a year.

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
- A year?- Well, do you have to go?

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
Well, I kind of have to, don't I?

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
Because of this stupid thing.

9
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
There's nothing like the supportof your loving wife, huh?

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
Wait a minute.Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.

11
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
Maybe you forgot, but we have ticketsto the Jets game next week!

12
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
I'm sorry, but I don't thinkI'll be able to make it.

13
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
But we were gonna go see the Jets!

14
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
You can't go. I mean, you're the gluethat holds this group together.

15
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
- Really?- Not you.

16
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
I can't believe you guys are moving.

17
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56

21
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
- Here you go, Rach.- Thank you, Joey.

22
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
You know what?I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.

23
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
I went through this with Ben and Carol.One coffee won't affect your milk.

24
00:01:35 --> 00:01:38
Just to be sure,I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.

25
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
Every time?

26
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
You don't have to call himwhenever you have a question, okay?

27
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
- Trust me. I know this.- All right. I trust you.

28
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
I can see you dialing.I don't understand why...

29
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?

30
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachelwith a baby. It's just so grownup.

31
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
I know, yeah.I feel like we're all growing up.

32
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
A person named "Wiener."God, that kills me.

33
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
- Look at you all grownup.- Well, actually, you know what?

34
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
I am, you know?

35
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
Well, that whole thingwith Rachel made me realize...

36
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
...that maybe I'm ready for a moreserious relationship, you know?

37
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
Like, I'd like to meet a nice,mature, commitment-minded lady.

38
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
And looks aren't as important as...

39
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
Nah, she's gotta be hot.

40
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
You know, I might know somebody.

41
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
How about you set me upwith someone, and we double-date?

42
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
I can do that. Yeah.How's Friday?

43
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
- Done!- All right.

44
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
Good, really?Okay, let's see.

45
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
All right.

46
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
You know who's great?Sandy Poopack.

47
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
"Poopack"?

48
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
Yeah. All right.Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.

49
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
- I've got good news.- You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?

50
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
Okay, I have news.

51
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
You don't have to move to Tulsa.You can stay here and keep your job.

52
00:02:59 --> 00:03:00
That's great! How?

53
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
My boss and I worked out a dealwhere I'm in Tulsa four days a week.

54
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
So the other three,I can be here with you.

55
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
So you're gonna be gonefour days a week?

56
00:03:09 --> 00:03:10
No.

57
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
I'm sorry, are you justused to saying that?

58
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
No. I can't be awayfrom you for that long.

59
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
- Really?- Yeah, you're my husband.

60
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
I won't live in a different statethan you for 208 days out of the year.

61
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
That's fast math.We could use you in Tulsa.

62
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
Thanks for trying to figure out a way,but if you go to Tulsa, I go with you.

63
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
You said that without gagging.

64
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
I know!

65
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
Well, excuse me?

66
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
Oh, yeah?Well, up yours too!

67
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
- Who the hell was that?- Dr. Wiener.

68
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
Rach, you can't call peopleat 3:00 in the morning.

69
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
You know what?You sound just like his wife.

70
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
Was there anythingeven wrong with Emma?

71
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
Yes, of course there is!Okay? I'm not insane.

72
00:04:00 --> 00:04:00
What was it?

73
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Hiccups.

74
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
I told you, you can't call himevery time any little thing comes up.

75
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
Well, not anymore I can't.He fired us!

76
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
What are we gonna do?We have to find a pediatrician.

77
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Wait, Monica said thatwhen you guys were growing up...

78
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
...you liked your doctor.What was his name?

79
00:04:18 --> 00:04:19
Dr. Gettleman?

80
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
Yeah, no, I don't thinkthat's a good idea.

81
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
In fact, I think he's dead.

82
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
Why does everything happen to me?

83
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
I promise, first thing tomorrow,we'll find another doctor.

84
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
But I gotta get up early,and I'm not feeling well.

85
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
You're not feeling well?What do you have? Rubella?

86
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
Because don't go near Emma,she has not had that shot.

87
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
You know, come to think of it,it does feel rubella-like.

88
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
Wiener!

89
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

90
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
Rachel!

91
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Great! Now he's gonnaknow it was me!

92
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
So how is thisfor our big double date tonight?

93
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
Oh, my God.

94
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
Great. Just the reactionI was hoping for.

95
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
Yeah, so you found someone for me?You didn't forget?

96
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
Of course not.And you'll love Mary Ellen.

97
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
She's really smart and cuteand funny and...

98
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
I can't tell you how I know this,but she is not opposed to threesomes.

99
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
All right.

100
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
- So tell me something about my guy.- No.

101
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
Come on, give me something.What's his name?

102
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
- Mike.- Mike. Okay, what's his last name?

103
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
Damn it! Is there no mystery leftin romance anymore?!

104
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
We'll see you and Mikeat the restaurant in a couple hours.

105
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
All right, great.See you. Bye-bye.

106
00:05:44 --> 00:05:48
Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't knowa Mike! Why couldn't I have said...?

107
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
There's no guys in there!

108
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
It's impossible to find a good doctor.How do you know the good ones...

109
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
...from the ones who'll pushtheir penis against your knee?

110
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
Excuse me?

111
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
I know what she's talking about.

112
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Well, we've gotta finda new pediatrician.

113
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Ross was getting sick last night,and Emma may have caught it.

114
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
- Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?- Ross said he died.

115
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
He didn't die.I just saw his daughter last week.

116
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
She said he was fine.Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.

117
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
Great. Well then, I'm gonnatake Emma to see him.

118
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
I wonder why Ross said that he died?

119
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
Maybe he confused himwith his childhood therapist.

120
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
He saw a therapist?

121
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
He used to have a recurring nightmare.It freaked him out.

122
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
Wow, what was it?

123
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
That I was going to eat him.

124
00:06:47 --> 00:06:48
Mike!

125
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
Yeah?

126
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Okay.

127
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
I can't believeI'm doing this with you.

128
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
Although I did just enda nine-year relationship...

129
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
...so I should be opento taking some risks.

130
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
It'll be fine.Follow my lead, okay?

131
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
All you have to do ispretend to be Mike.

132
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
- I am Mike.- Attaboy.

133
00:07:11 --> 00:07:12
Here they come.

134
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
- I'm Phoebe.- Phoebe. Mike. How you doing?

135
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
- Nice to meet you.- Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.

136
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
So, Mike, how do you and Joeyknow each other, anyway?

137
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
How do Joey and I know each other?

138
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
If I had a nickel for every timesomebody's asked me that.

139
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
- From school.- We met in college.

140
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
I mean high school.

141
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
You guys go way back, then.So, what are you up to these days?

142
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
- Well, I'm a lawyer.- Mike, attorney at law!

143
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
- Actually, I just gave up my practice.- What?

144
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
That's the kind of thingyou usually run by me.

145
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
I want to play piano professionally.If I don't do this now, I never will.

146
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
Great. I like that betterthan the lawyer thing.

147
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
Which is why I waited until nowto introduce you to Mike.

148
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
You thought he was still a lawyer.

149
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
No, that's not what I meant.Let's get you a cocktail.

150
00:08:05 --> 00:08:06
What are you doing?

151
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Looking for restaurant jobsfor you in Tulsa.

152
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
That's so sweet.Did you find anything?

153
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
- Slim Pickins.- Nothing, huh?

154
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
No. Slim Pickins.It's a barbecue joint.

155
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
They're looking for a cook. Actually,"cook" may be a bit of a stretch.

156
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
They're looking for somebodyto shovel mesquite.

157
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
"Slim Pickins"? That is so cheesy.

158
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.

159
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
Honey, that's okay.I know this woman, Nancy...

160
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
...who's a restaurant biz headhunter.She may know something.

161
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
Can I say how much I appreciateyou coming with me?

162
00:08:33 --> 00:08:37
When we get to Tulsa, I am taking youfor a great dinner at Slim Pickins.

163
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
So Cheesy?

164
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
Whole Hog?

165
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
It's gonna be toughto keep kosher in Tulsa.

166
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
Hi, Nancy?Hi, it's Monica Geller.

167
00:08:51 --> 00:08:56
I'm good. Listen, I'm lookingfor a job in Tulsa.

168
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
Yeah, well, my husband'sbeen relocated.

169
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
Because I love him.

170
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
No, I don't want a job in New York.

171
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
Javu's looking? Oh, my God!

172
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
He asked for me personally?Oh, my God!

173
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
Wow, this is really,really flattering.

174
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
But I'm moving to Tulsa.

175
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
So, just, if you would tell Javu...

176
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
...I'll take it!

177
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
My name's Rachel Greene.I have an appointment for Emma.

178
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
Dr. Gettleman is finishing upwith a patient. He'll be out shortly.

179
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
I think you just have a cold.It's definitely not strep.

180
00:09:29 --> 00:09:30
Thanks, doctor.

181
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
- Would you like a lollipop?- Do you even have to ask?

182
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
He is alive!

183
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
It's so surprising that you and Joeyhave known each other for so long...

184
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
...and I've never heard about you.

185
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
That's because we hada bit of a falling out.

186
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
Mike hit my mom with a car.

187
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
- No, I didn't.- That's okay. I have forgiven you.

188
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
Now we're friends again,and everything's great.

189
00:10:03 --> 00:10:04
Well, wait. Is your mom okay?

190
00:10:04 --> 00:10:08
Please, we're tryingto have a conversation.

191
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
You're a lot niceron "Days of Our Lives."

192
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
"Days of Our Lives"!That's why you look so familiar!

193
00:10:13 --> 00:10:13
- What?- What?

194
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
What?

195
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
Do you not know each other?

196
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
Of course we do. He's playing a gamewe used to play in high school.

197
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
We pretend we don't know each other.We played all kinds of games.

198
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
You remember that one where I punchyou in the face for not being cool?

199
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
Let me ask you something:How many sisters does Joey have?

200
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
- Six.- What are you doing? I said seven!

201
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
Joey, why did you set me upwith a stranger?

202
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
Because I forgot about our date.I'm so sorry.

203
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
I'm sorry too. And just to be clear,I didn't hit his mother with a car.

204
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
You are unbelievable. I spent so muchtime finding the perfect girl for you.

205
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
Mary Ellen is really smartand cute and loose.

206
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
Who are you kidding?

207
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
You find some guyoff the street for me?

208
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
God, this is humiliating!

209
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
I'm so sorry. If you don't like this guy,I can find you a better one.

210
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Mike? Mike?

211
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
I'm out of here.

212
00:11:16 --> 00:11:17
It was nice meeting you.

213
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
- You're leaving too?- I'll stay if you can tell me my name.

214
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
Have a good night.

215
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
We leave tomorrow,and you still have a lot to pack.

216
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
You're right.

217
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
Maybe I shouldn't go.

218
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
What?

219
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
So Nancy told me about this jobat this great restaurant, Javu?

220
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
But it's justa little outside of Tulsa.

221
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
Well, how far outside?

222
00:11:40 --> 00:11:41
Manhattan?

223
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
And you're thinking of taking it?

224
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
Before, you said that being with mewas more important than any job.

225
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
But I guess now it'sold job, me, new job.

226
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
I'm gonna miss this hand!

227
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
I know this is a lot to ask...

228
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
...but, my God, this isa once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

229
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
What happened to "you can't livewithout me four days a week"?

230
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
Well, if you really think about it,I mean, four days is not that long.

231
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
I see you Mondaybefore you go to work...

232
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
...and Thursday when you get back...

233
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
...and I always work late on Tuesdays,so really if you think about it...

234
00:12:15 --> 00:12:16
...it's really just one day.

235
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
And well, if we can't make it one day,we got real problems, my friend.

236
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
- I think you should take the job.- Really?

237
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
I know it must be important to youwhen you start chattering like a monkey.

238
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
That's the nicest thinganybody's ever said to me.

239
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
- How was the pediatrician?- I really liked him.

240
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
Yeah, yeah.It was really, really, really good.

241
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
- You promised not to say anything.- I know.

242
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
Ross still sees his pediatrician!

243
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
I don't care.

244
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Are you serious?You still see Dr. Gettleman?

245
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
He is a brilliant diagnostician!

246
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

247
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
Seriously, you gotta goto an appropriate doctor.

248
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
Why? I know it's a little weird,but he is a great doctor, okay?

249
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
He knows my medical history.

250
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
And every time I go in there,he makes a big deal.

251
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
You know,"Look, it's my favorite patient."

252
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
Does he say that before he stickshis thermometer in your tushy?

253
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
I seem to remember someone bringinghis security blanket to college.

254
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
That was not a security blanket.That was a wall hanging.

255
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
It didn't spend much time on the wall!

256
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
Excuse me.

257
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
Hi. I was hoping to run into you.Can we talk?

258
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
Sure.

259
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
I'm sorry, really.I'm so embarrassed...

260
00:13:42 --> 00:13:44
...that our...

261
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.Just ask my parole officer.

262
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
Apparently, I'm not a funny guy.

263
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
Well, why did you go along with that?

264
00:13:58 --> 00:14:02
Because I was told that I'd geta free dinner, which I didn't.

265
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
And that I'd meet a pretty girl,which I did.

266
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
That's true.

267
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
Well, is anything you told meabout yourself true?

268
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
My name is Mike.And I do play piano.

269
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
- Prove it.- There isn't a piano here.

270
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
That wouldn't stand in the wayof a true pianist.

271
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
Okay.

272
00:14:37 --> 00:14:38
You are really good.

273
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
- I play a little guitar myself.- Really? That's great.

274
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
- What kind of music do you play?- Like acoustic, folksy stuff, you know?

275
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
But right now I'm working ona couple Iron Maiden covers.

276
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
Do you think that, maybe,sometime, I could...

277
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

278
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
Okay. You think, maybe,sometime I could take you out?

279
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
You just caught me off guard.

280
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
Yeah, that would be nice.

281
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
Look at this! My two best friends!

282
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
Excuse me.I don't mean to be a jerk...

283
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
...but the baby with the rashcame in after me.

284
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
The doctor will be right with you, sir.

285
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.

286
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
What, the circus?He's behind the elephant.

287
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
Wow. So your child's a big fanof the Waldo books too?

288
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
Yeah, that's how I know.

289
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
- I'm Ross, by the way.- Hi, I'm Sally.

290
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
So no ring. Can I assumeyou're also a single parent?

291
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
- I am a single parent.- It's hard, isn't it?

292
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
There's no time for a social life.Where are you gonna meet someone?

293
00:15:49 --> 00:15:55
Let's say, I don't know, you metsomeone in the pediatrician's office.

294
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
Rossie? We're ready for you.

295
00:16:04 --> 00:16:05
Yeah...

296
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
Come on, Ross Jr.It's time to go in.

297
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
Mommy.

298
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?

299
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!

300
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
- Good, you haven't left yet.- Where have you been?

301
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
I got held upat Dr. Gettleman's office.

302
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
There was some guythat freaked everybody out.

303
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
You got here just in time.I really have to go, buddy.

304
00:16:38 --> 00:16:38
Oh, man.

305
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
- Promise to call me when you land?- Of course I will. I love you.

306
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
I love you too.

307
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
Watch the tongue, people.We got a baby over here.

308
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
- Bye, Chandler.- Bye.

309
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
- Bye, honey.- Bye.

310
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
- What's the matter, Joe?- I'm mad at you for leaving.

311
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
You know, you're nothingbut a big leaver.

312
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

313
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
Any chance you're trying to picka fight to make all of this easier?

314
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
Dude, you see right through me!

315
00:17:25 --> 00:17:26
Okay, well... Bye, Mon.

316
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
Bye, Ross. Rachel.

317
00:17:29 --> 00:17:32
- Bye, Emma.- Okay, bye-bye.

318
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
Have a good trip. Okay.Oh, my God.

319
00:17:38 --> 00:17:39
Wait.

320
00:17:40 --> 00:17:43
It goes old job...

321
00:17:43 --> 00:17:44
...new job...

322
00:17:45 --> 00:17:45
...and you.

323
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
This is just something I have to do.

324
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
I know.

325
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
I love you so much.

326
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
I know that too.

327
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
Don't worry.I'll be back before you know it.

328
00:18:07 --> 00:18:08
Yes, it will be the same.

329
00:18:09 --> 00:18:11
Because I know, that's how.

330
00:18:11 --> 00:18:12
I promise.

331
00:18:12 --> 00:18:13
You double promise?

332
00:18:17 --> 00:18:18
Call me when you land.

333
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
- Can I talk now?- Okay, bye.

334
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23

335
