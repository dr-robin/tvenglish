1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
Have you seen our bank statement?Can this be right?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
I know. God, I haven't seenmy savings take a hit like this...

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
...since I was a kid and they came upwith Double Stuf Oreos.

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
- What happened to all of our money?- I'm not sure exactly what they did...

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
...but I'm inclined to blame Enron.

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
With you doing the internship, we'respending more than we're bringing in.

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
Yeah, maybe I should quitand get a job that pays.

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
But you're finally doing somethingthat you love.

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
Although it would be nice if the thingthat you loved was finding gold.

11
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
You know, I think we're makingtoo big a deal out of this.

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
We'll pay our bills late this month. Nextmonth we'll cut back on a few things.

13
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
And maybe we start eatingout of Joey's refrigerator for a change.

14
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
You're a chef. What can you makeout of baking soda and beer?

15
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
Worst-case scenario is, we borrowsome money from my parents.

16
00:00:49 --> 00:00:51
No, we're not borrowing money.

17
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
- Why not?- We don't do that. We are Bings.

18
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
If there's one thing my fathertaught me, it was...

19
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
...well, to always knockbefore going into the pool house.

20
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
- The other thing is, never borrow money.- I had no idea you had this much pride.

21
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
That's right, I do. I am your man.I'm gonna get us through this situation...

22
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
...even if it means you workingtwice as hard.

26
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
- I'm gonna go.- Why?

27
00:01:45 --> 00:01:47
I haven't been home in days,and I need to get more clothes.

28
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
You don't have to go.I have something that'll fit you.

29
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
I put that tube top on as a joke.

30
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
- I want you to stay.- I want to stay too.

31
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
But I've got as much useout of these boxers as I can.

32
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
- Why don't you turn them inside...- Done it.

33
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.- All right. I'll miss you.

34
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
Me too.

35
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
You know what? I just realizedsomething. I don't want to go home.

36
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
- Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.- No, no, what I mean is...

37
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
...I hate going backto my apartment now.

38
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
Partly because I live abovea known crack den...

39
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
...but, you know, mostly becausewhen I'm there, I really miss you.

40
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
So...

41
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
...do you want to move in together?

42
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
Wow, Mike Hanigan...

43
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
...you sure know how tomake a girl say "Hell, yeah."

44
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
- So we're doing it?- Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.

45
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
- We're really gonna move in together?- Yeah.

46
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
I've always wanted to live with a guy.

47
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Pick up your socks.Put down the toilet seat.

48
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
No, we are not having sex anymore.

49
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
It's gonna be fun.

50
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
- Hey, Joey.- Hey.

51
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
Listen, I need to knowthat what I'm about to ask you...

52
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
...will never get back to Chandler.

53
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
I'd be lying if I said I hadn'tthought about it myself.

54
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
But Chandler is my best friend.It would be wrong.

55
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
Good, but wrong.

56
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
Okay, first of all, it would be great.

57
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
But that's not what I'm here to talkto you about. I need to borrow money.

58
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
Oh, I don't know, Monica.You know...

59
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
...lending friends moneyis always a mistake.

60
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
- But Chandler lent you money.- And he would tell you it was a mistake.

61
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
Come on, I just... I need itfor some rent and some other bills.

62
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
Well, how much?

63
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
- Two thousand dollars?- Two thousand dollars?

64
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
What do you think I am,a soap opera star?

65
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
- Yeah.- That's right, I am.

66
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
- Hi, you guys.- Hey.

67
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
- What's in the bag?- You know how Emma started crawling?

68
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
I realized that this placeis very unsafe for a baby...

69
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
...so I went to the store and I got somestuff to baby-proof the apartment.

70
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
Oh, God, baby-proofing.

71
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
Why is it such a big deal now?You know, when I was a kid, it was like:

72
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
"Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs."

73
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
Or, "Whoops, Joey electrocutedhimself again."

74
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
Anyway, are you going to geta handyman to install this stuff?

75
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
No, I was just gonna do it myself.

76
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
- You're gonna do it?- Yeah. Why?

77
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
- You don't think a woman can do this?- Women can. You can't.

78
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
Monica, will you please tell Joeythat he is a pig.

79
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
- You're a pig. And you can't do this.- What?

80
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
What? Come on, I foundthe hardware store all by myself.

81
00:04:34 --> 00:04:35
The store's right down the street.

82
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
There is a hardware storeright down the street?

83
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
Hey, you guys?Okay, we've got great news.

84
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
- Phoebe and I are moving in together.- Congratulations.

85
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
I know, it's so exciting. You know,I've never lived with a guy before.

86
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
Well, it's just like living with a girl,only they don't steal your makeup.

87
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
Unless they're playing "This Is WhatMy Sister Would Look Like."

88
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
Yeah, she's not so cute.

89
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.- Well, you put down the toilet seat.

90
00:05:01 --> 00:05:02
Yes, dear.

91
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
- Is that a bit you guys do?- Uh-huh. We're playing you two.

92
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
We don't do that.Tell her we don't do that.

93
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Yes, dear.

94
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
I can't believe you're moving intogether. I'm happy for you guys.

95
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
- I hear wedding bells.- Monica, slow down, okay?

96
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
I'm just excited to be living with him.

97
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
You know, I mean, I don't know...

98
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
...can I see someday beingmarried to Mike? Sure. Yeah.

99
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
I could picture myself walking downthe aisle in a wedding dress...

100
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
...that highlights my breastsin an obvious yet classy way.

101
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
But do I want that house in Connecticutnear the good schools...

102
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
...where Mike and I could sendlittle Sophie and Mike Jr.?

103
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
Oh, my God, I do.

104
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
- I had no idea you were so conventional.- I know. I guess I am.

105
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,I want to be a soccer mom.

106
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
- You ready to go?- Yeah, you bet, roomie.

107
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
Don't you mean "groomie"?

108
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
- What are you talking about?- Please.

109
00:05:57 --> 00:06:01
We haven't even moved in yet, andthey have us picking out china patterns.

110
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
China patterns!

111
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
This is easy. "Can't do this..."

112
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
Wow, seriously. Can't do this.

113
00:06:25 --> 00:06:26
- Hey, Joe.- Hey.

114
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
Listen, I need to ask you a favor, andwe can't tell Monica anything about it.

115
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
- I thought you guys didn't have secrets.- That will remain the official party line.

116
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
Look, Monica and I are havinga little financial trouble.

117
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
- Yeah, I know.- What? What do you mean, you "know"?

118
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
I just figured it out, you know?

119
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
I mean, you're not working,and the economy is bad.

120
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
Oh, right.

121
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
That is the fastest I have ever thought.

122
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
Anyway...

123
00:06:56 --> 00:06:57
...I need to borrow some money.

124
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
Oh, sure. Yeah, how much?Two thousand dollars?

125
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Yes, $2000 exactly.How did you know that?

126
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
I know how much you used to make,and I know how much your rent is.

127
00:07:11 --> 00:07:12
Oh, okay.

128
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
I am on fire.

129
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
Listen, this is really nice.

130
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
Did you write a check to Monicafor $2000?

131
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
Did Monica borrow money from you?

132
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
- Kind of.- I can't believe her.

133
00:07:27 --> 00:07:28
Did she tell you we were havingmoney problems?

134
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
No, no, no. It wasn't becauseof your money problems.

135
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
It was for something for her.

136
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
What?

137
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
Something personal.

138
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
What would she get for $2000that she wouldn't tell me about?

139
00:07:39 --> 00:07:40
Excuse me.

140
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
Boob job.

141
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
I don't want her to get a boob job.That's crazy.

142
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Well, it's not that crazy, okay?

143
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
Making them smaller,that would be crazy.

144
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
Oh, hey, I wanted to ask youabout Monica's little "groomie" joke.

145
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
Well, I think the reason people laughedis that it's a play on the word "roomie."

146
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.

147
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
No, the thing I want to say is...

148
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
Maybe we should'vetalked about this before.

149
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
Us living together,you're not expecting a proposal, right?

150
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
- Oh, no, no. Not at all.- Okay.

151
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
We're just moving in right now.We'll see where it goes.

152
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
Yeah, well, that's the thing.For me, it's as far as it can ever go.

153
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
- What do you mean?- Look, Phoebe, I...

154
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
I love you very much.But I never want to get married again.

155
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
- Wow.- It's just, my first marriage was...

156
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
...you know, such a disaster thatI kind of lost faith in the whole idea.

157
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
- Was it that bad?- At one point, near the end...

158
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
...she deliberately defecated on my...- Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.

159
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
But don't you think it might bedifferent with someone else? Perhaps...

160
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
...a blond who alwaysuses the toilet?

161
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
Except for once in the ocean.

162
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
Look, it's not about who I would marry.

163
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
I was certain the first time I got marriedit'd last forever. I was wrong.

164
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
- But, it just...- Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.

165
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
I just never want to get married again.

166
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
Are you okay with that? If not, maybeus moving in together isn't the best idea.

168
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
No. Oh, I definitely don'twant to get married.

169
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
I just wanted to make sureyou didn't want to, too.

170
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
Because if we move inand you start changing your mind...

171
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
...there is gonna behell to pay, mister.

172
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
- Trust me. I will never...- Yeah, I get that. Yeah.

173
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
Hi. So you gave inand decided to call someone?

174
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
Yeah. I don't know who I was kidding.I can barely use chopsticks.

175
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
- You're all set.- Oh, thank you so much.

176
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
Wait. You forgot your...

177
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
...game.

178
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
Thank you.

179
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
Hey, Rach. There she is,my perfectly proportioned wife.

180
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
Don't look at me.I never get his jokes.

181
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
- Thank you?- No, no. Don't thank me.

182
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
Thank you. Do you know there is notone thing I would change about you?

183
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
Not one single thing.And definitely not...

184
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
...two single things.

185
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
Okay, you're being weird. Do you wantsex, or did you do something bad?

186
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
No. No. No. I just lovethe way you look. I am warm...

187
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
...for your form.

188
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
Okay, you know the old classics like,you know, "You look nice"?

189
00:10:22 --> 00:10:23
They're still okay.

190
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
But "you look nice" could meanthat I'm saying, "Your face looks nice."

191
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
I want to compliment your body.

192
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.

193
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
And more specifically, I wouldn'twant anything to get any bigger.

194
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
- Okay.- I mean...

195
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
...you wouldn't want any part of meto get any bigger, would you?

196
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
Don't answer that.

197
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
Just when you thought that dudecouldn't get any weirder.

198
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
Why do you think he was so worriedabout me getting bigger?

199
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
I don't know.I mean, what brought that on?

200
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
Oh, my God. You know what,we're trying to get pregnant...

201
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
...so he's probably starting to freak outthat my body's gonna change.

202
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
- You think that's what it is?- You heard him.

203
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
"No bigger. You're perfect.Just don't get any bigger."

204
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
My God, he sounded just likemy high-school wrestling coach.

205
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
- I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.- Yeah. If you don't, I will.

206
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
Of course your body's gonna change.Your breasts are gonna get bigger...

207
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
...your ass is gonna get bigger...

208
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
...you're gonna lose bladder control.

209
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
God, it's just such a magical time.

210
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
Hi. Listen, I wanted to ask yousomething about marriage.

211
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
Now you're seeking me outto make jokes?

212
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
I mean, I can see if we're all hangingout, but to come to my home...

213
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
No, I really want to knowhow you feel about it.

214
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
- Why?- Mike doesn't ever want to get married.

215
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
- Never?- Never.

216
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
Wow. Are you still gonnamove in with him?

217
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
I want to, but I wanted you to tell methat marriage really isn't that big a deal.

218
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
You know, that I won't be missing outon anything. That marriage stinks.

219
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
Yeah, marriage stinks.

220
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
I mean, if you want to see a man gainweight and a woman stop shaving...

221
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
...get them married.

222
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
- That's not how you really feel, is it?- No, I'm sorry.

223
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
I know it's not what you want to hear,but I can't help it. I love marriage.

224
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
Seriously, you?"Divorce-o"?

225
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
If you have to call me a name, I'd prefer"Ross, the Divorcer." It's just cooler.

226
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
Look, I know my marriagesdidn't exactly work out...

227
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
...but, you know, I loved beingthat committed to another person.

228
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
And Carol and I had some good timesbefore she became a lesbian.

229
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
And once afterward.

230
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
Anyway, I'm sorry.

231
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
It's okay. That's how you feel.

232
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
But, come on, I mean,living together will be great.

233
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
I mean, you guys have so much fun.And you love Mike.

234
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
- I do love Mike.- Yeah, see?

235
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
And you were so excited aboutmoving in together before...

236
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
...and you know what, you should be.It's a big deal.

237
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
Yeah, I guess you're right.

238
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.

239
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
The Divorcer to the rescue.

240
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
- It's not cooler.- Yeah, I just heard it.

241
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
Rach?

242
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
Rachel?!

243
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
So I can't do anything I like?!

244
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
Hey, Rach.

245
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
Perfection.Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.

246
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
- Honey?- Yeah?

247
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
About that.

248
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
- I'm going to change.- Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.

249
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
I'm gonna get bigger.

250
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
Honey, I...

251
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
I love your breasts the way they are.

252
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
Fascist.

253
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
My breasts are gonna get biggerwhether you like it or not.

254
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
And it's not just my breasts.My ass is gonna get bigger too.

255
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
Your ass?!

256
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
And don't be surprised if her handsand her feet get bigger too.

257
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
- They do that?- It's kind of a package deal.

258
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
God, why? Why would you want todo that to yourself?

259
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
I thought it was somethingthat we both wanted.

260
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
If it means that much to you, I may beable to get onboard with the boobs...

261
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
...but the giant assand the big clown feet?

262
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
Oh, my God, Chandler.

263
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
If you can't handle this,what will you be like in the hospital...

264
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
...with the blood and screaming and thelittle person that's shooting out of her?

265
00:14:30 --> 00:14:31
What?

266
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
Joey, why did you tell Chandlerthat Monica was getting a boob job?

267
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
Because she is.

268
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
- Chandler knows I borrowed the money.- For your boob job.

269
00:14:46 --> 00:14:47
- Joe...- It's over.

270
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
Okay, so I'm out $4000 andnobody's boobs are getting any bigger?

271
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
Hey. Hey, what do you guys thinkabout this: Ross, the Divorce Force.

272
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
- Better.- Yeah?

273
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
Very cool.

274
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
Hey, Pheebs? You know, I'm really gladyou came to talk to me the other day...

275
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
...and I hope I was a little helpful.- Yeah, you were helpful.

276
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
- Yeah. No, thank you.- Good. Good.

277
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
Because the more I thought about it,the more I realized...

278
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
...I don't think marriage is necessarilythe right path for you.

279
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
What do you mean?

280
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
I know the other dayin the coffeehouse...

281
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
...you were all caught upin the whole soccer-mom thing...

282
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
...but is that really you? I mean, can youhonestly picture yourself in a Volvo?

283
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
They are awfully boxy.

284
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
I mean, I don't know, you'd be so boredwith marriage. I mean, it's so normal.

285
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
Yeah.

286
00:15:37 --> 00:15:38
Hey, can I help?

287
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,maneuvered a narrow hallway...

288
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
...dodged a rabid pit bull. But these lastthree feet are where it gets really tricky.

289
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
You know, sometimes your words,they hurt.

290
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
Hey, where do you guys want this?

291
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
Yeah, seriously,because this is really heavy.

292
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
I mean, not for me, because I'm onlypretending to hold it, but for these guys.

293
00:16:00 --> 00:16:05
Just one last time on the marriage thing.There's no wiggle room? None at all?

294
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
No, but you don't want toget married either, right?

295
00:16:08 --> 00:16:09
Right.

296
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
Except that I do want to get married.

297
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
Couldn't have had this conversationdown at the truck, huh?

298
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
What? You want to get married?

299
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
Someday.

300
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
And... hernia.

301
00:16:21 --> 00:16:26
I haven't had a normal life. And I neverfelt like I was missing out on anything.

302
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
But it feels like now it's my turnto have some of the regular stuff.

303
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
Why didn't you say something before?

304
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
I didn't know how much I wanted it. AndI love you, and I wanted to live with you.

305
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
I want to live with you too.I mean, let's do that.

306
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
But I don't think I can.

307
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
It was okay to move in whenI didn't know what was gonna happen.

308
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
But I can't move in knowing nothingis ever gonna happen.

309
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
Can we at least try living together? Youmight change your mind about marriage.

310
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
Are you gonna change yours?

311
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
No.

312
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
Me neither.

313
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
I think I need to be with someonewho wants what I want.

314
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
But I don't want this to end.

315
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
No, I don't want it to end either.

316
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
I can't believe this is gonna end.

317
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
I guess I'll have my stuff picked up.

318
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
Yeah. Okay.

319
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
Okay, so...

320
00:17:37 --> 00:17:38
Goodbye.

321
00:17:39 --> 00:17:42
- Take it easy, Mike.- Bye, Mike.

322
00:17:46 --> 00:17:47
I'm so sorry, Pheebs.

323
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
We're all sorry.

324
00:17:51 --> 00:17:56
Look on the bright side. At least youwon't have to live with this ugly chair.

325
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
That was here already, huh?

326
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
I love you.

327
00:18:09 --> 00:18:11
I did it! I did it!

328
00:18:11 --> 00:18:14
All right.

329
00:18:17 --> 00:18:20
I'd better take all I can carry.

330
00:18:20 --> 00:18:23
Who knows when I'll be ableto get in here again, huh?

331
00:18:29 --> 00:18:29
