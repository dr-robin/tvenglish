00:00:01 --> 00:00:01
I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
So how was Joan?

4
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
Broke up with her.

5
00:00:08 --> 00:00:08
Oh, why?

6
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
Don't tell me.Because of the big nostril thing?

7
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
They were huge!

8
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
When she sneezed,bats flew out of them.

9
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
They were not that huge.

10
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
I'm telling you, she leaned back,I could see her brain.

11
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
How many women will you reject...

12
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
...over superficial,insignificant things...

13
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
Hold it. I gotta sidewith Chandler on this one.

14
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
When I first moved here,I went out with this girl.

15
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
Really hot. Great kisser...

16
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
...but she had the biggestAdam's apple.

17
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
Drove me nuts.

18
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
- You or me?- I got it.

19
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

20
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
You guys are messing with me, right?

21
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
Yeah. We are!

22
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
That's a good one.For a second there, I was like, whoa!

25
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
You name one woman that you broke upwith for an actual real reason.

26
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
Maureen Rasillo.

27
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
Because she doesn't hate Yanniis not a real reason.

28
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
Hello, Mr. Heckles.

29
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
You're doing it again.

30
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
We're not doing anything.

31
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
You're stomping.It's disturbing my birds.

32
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
You don't have birds.

33
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
I could have birds.

34
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
We'll try to keep it down.

35
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
Thank you.

36
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

37
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
All right, bye-bye.

38
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
Okay, Janice.

39
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
Give me Janice.That wasn't about being picky.

40
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
We'll give you Janice.

41
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
I miss Janice, though.

42
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Hello, Chandler Bing!

43
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
Oh, my God!

44
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
Oh, Chandler!

45
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
Now! Now!

46
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
That's it.

47
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
There! Faster!

48
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42
Stop with the broom!We're not making noise!

49
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
We won.

50
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
We did it!

51
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
Mr. Heckles!

52
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
- How did this happen?- He was sweeping.

53
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
They found a broom in his hand.

54
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
- That's terrible.- I know.

55
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
I was sweeping yesterday.

56
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
It could've been me.

57
00:03:11 --> 00:03:12
Sweeping. You never know.

58
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
Never know.

59
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
It's very faint, but I canstill sense him in the building.

60
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!

61
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
Okay, Phoebe.

62
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
I'm sorry,but sometimes they need help.

63
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
Here we go.

64
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

65
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
There are a lot of thingsI don't believe in...

66
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
...but that doesn't meanthey're not true.

67
00:03:38 --> 00:03:39
Such as?

68
00:03:39 --> 00:03:44
Like crop circles orthe Bermuda Triangle or evolution.

69
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
What, you don't believe in evolution?

70
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
Not really.

71
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
You don't believe in evolution?

72
00:03:53 --> 00:03:54
I don't know.It's just, you know...

73
00:03:55 --> 00:04:00
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.I just think it's a little too easy.

74
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
"Too easy"? Too...

75
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
The process of every living thingon this planet evolving...

76
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
...over millions of years fromsingle-celled organisms is "too easy"?

77
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

78
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
Excuse me. Evolution is notfor you to buy, Phoebe.

79
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
Evolution is scientific fact,like the air we breathe...

80
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
...like gravity.

81
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
Don't get me started on gravity.

82
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
You don't believe in gravity?

83
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
Well, it's not so much that,you know, I don't believe in it.

84
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Lately I get the feeling that...

85
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
...I'm not so much being pulled downas I am being pushed.

86
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Pushed.

87
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.

88
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
There she is. And over there,that's the other one.

89
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
This is Mr. Buddy Doyle,Heckles' attorney.

90
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
He'd like to talk to you.

91
00:04:51 --> 00:04:51
What can we do for you?

92
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
All right, kids, here's the deal.

93
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
According my client's will...

94
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
...he wants to leaveall his earthly possessions...

95
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
...to "the noisy girlsin the apartment above mine."

96
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
What about his family?

97
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
He didn't have any.

98
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
Okay, so let's talk money.

99
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
All right, there was none.

100
00:05:12 --> 00:05:13
Now, let's talk signing.

101
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
You be noisy girl number one.You be noisy girl number two.

102
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
I can't believe that this whole timewe thought he hated us.

103
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
Isn't it amazing how muchyou can touch someone's life...

104
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
...without even knowing it?

105
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
Would you look at this dump?

106
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
He hated us!This was his final revenge!

107
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
I've never seen so much crap!

108
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
Actually, I think this apartmentsullies the good name of crap.

109
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Check this out.

110
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
Can I have this?

111
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
How can you not believe in evolution?

112
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
I don't know, just don't.Look at this funky shirt!

113
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
Pheebs, I've studied evolutionmy entire adult life.

114
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
And we've collected fossilsfrom all over the world...

115
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
...that actually show the evolutionof different species.

116
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
I mean, you can literally see them...

117
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
...evolving through time.

118
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
Really? You can actually see it?

119
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
You bet! In the U.S.,China, Africa, all over!

120
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
See, I didn't know that.

121
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Well, there you go.

122
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
So now the real question is,who put those fossils there and why?

123
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
My Big Book of Grievances.

124
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
Hey, there's me!

125
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
"April 17 th, excessive noise...

126
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
...Italian guy comes home with a date."

127
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
You're in here too.

128
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
"April 18th, excessive noise...

129
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
...Italian guy's gay roommatebrings home dry cleaning."

130
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Well, that's excellent.

131
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
Look at this lamp.

132
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Is this tacky or what?We have to have this.

133
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
I think we have enough regular lamps.

134
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
What? Come on, it's not like...

135
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
...I'm asking for thisgirlie clock or anything.

136
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Which, by the way,I also think is really cool.

137
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
Look, it doesn't gowith any of my stuff.

138
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
Well, what about my stuff?

139
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
You don't have any stuff.

140
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
You still think of itas your apartment, don't you?

141
00:07:08 --> 00:07:09
Yes, you do.

142
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
You think of it as your apartmentand I just rent a room.

143
00:07:14 --> 00:07:19
While you "mmm" on that,I'll go find a place for my new lamp.

144
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm makingthese little toys move?

145
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
Opposable thumbs!

146
00:07:28 --> 00:07:32
Without evolution, how do youexplain opposable thumbs?

147
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
Maybe the Overlords needed themto steer their spacecrafts.

148
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
Tell me you're joking.

149
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
Look, can't we say that you believein something and I don't?

150
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
- No, Pheebs, we can't.- Why not?

151
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
What is this obsessive needto make everybody agree with you?

152
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
No, what's that all about?You know what I think?

153
00:07:49 --> 00:07:55
I think maybe it's timeyou put Ross under the microscope.

154
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

155
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Check it out.Heckles' high-school yearbook.

156
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
He looks so normal!

157
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
He's even kind of cute.

158
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
"Heckles, you crack me upin science class."

159
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
"You're the funniest kid in school."

160
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
- Funniest? Heckles?- That's what it says.

161
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
Heckles was voted class clown,and so was I.

162
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
He was right!Would you listen to that?

163
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
I'd call that excessive.

164
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
What?

165
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
Heckles played clarinet in band,and I played clarinet.

166
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
He was in the scalemodeler's club and I was...

167
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
There was no club,but I sure thought they were cool.

168
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
So? You were both dorks.

169
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
Big deal.

170
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
I just think it's weird, you know?Heckles and me...

171
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
Heckles and me. Me...

172
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
Me and Heckles.

173
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
Hey, would you knock it off!

174
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
Have you been here all night?

175
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
Look at this.

176
00:09:01 --> 00:09:02
Pictures of all the womenHeckles went out with.

177
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
Look what he wrote on them."Vivian, too tall."

178
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
"Madge, big gums."

179
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
"Too loud."

180
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
"Too smart.""Makes noise when she eats."

181
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
This is me.

182
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
This is what I do.

183
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
I'm gonna end up alone,just like he did.

184
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
Heckles was a nut case.

185
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
Our trains are on the same track.

186
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
I'm coming up 30 years behind him,but the stops are all the same.

187
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
Bitter Town...

188
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!

189
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
You know what we gotta do?Get you out of here.

190
00:09:31 --> 00:09:32
I'll buy you breakfast.

191
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
What if I never find somebody?Or worse, what if I found her...

192
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
...but I dumped her becauseshe pronounces it, "supposably"?

193
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
Chandler, come on,you're gonna find somebody.

194
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
How do you know that? How?

195
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
I don't know. I'm justtrying to help you out.

196
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
You guys will all get married...

197
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
...and I'll end up alone.

198
00:09:49 --> 00:09:50
Will you promise me something?

199
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
When you're married, will youinvite me over for holidays?

200
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
I don't know what we'll be doing.

201
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
I mean, what if we're overat her folks' place?

202
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
Yeah, I understand.

203
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
You can come overand watch the Super Bowl.

204
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Every year, all right?

205
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
You know what?I'm not gonna end up like this.

206
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
I'll see you, man.

207
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
"Supposably."

208
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
Supposably!

209
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
Did they go to the zoo?

210
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
Supposably.

211
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
Hi. It's me.

212
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
Oh, my God!

213
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
Janice? You called Janice?

214
00:10:53 --> 00:10:53
Yes. Janice.

215
00:10:54 --> 00:10:55
Why is that difficult to comprehend?

216
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
You remember Janice, right?

217
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
Yes. She was smart, she was prettyand she honestly cared about me.

218
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
Janice is my last chanceto have somebody.

219
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
Oh, my God!

220
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
Jeez, look how fat she got.

221
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
- Hey, it's everybody!- Hi, Janice.

222
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
Janice, you're...

223
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
Yes, I am.

224
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
- Is it...?- Is it yours?

225
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
You wish, Chandler Bing!

226
00:11:26 --> 00:11:31
You are looking at a married lady now.

227
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
Congratulations.

228
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

229
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
You couldn't tell me on the phone?

230
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
And what? Miss the expressionon your face? Oh, no!

231
00:11:41 --> 00:11:45
Janice likes to have her fun!

232
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
You know what we haven'tplayed in a while?

233
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
Hide the lamp.

234
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
Monica, let it go.

235
00:12:01 --> 00:12:02
Did you knowI'm allergic to shellfish?

236
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
Then you'll just haveto eat the other lamps.

237
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
It's scary scientist man.

238
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

239
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
In this briefcase I carryactual scientific facts.

240
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

241
00:12:20 --> 00:12:25
Some of these fossils areover 200 million years old.

242
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
Before you even start,I'm not denying evolution.

243
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
It's just one of the possibilities.

244
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
It's the only possibility.

245
00:12:31 --> 00:12:35
Ross, could you just openyour mind, like, this much?

246
00:12:35 --> 00:12:39
Didn't the brightest minds inthe world believe the Earth was flat?

247
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
And up till 50 years ago, you thoughtthe atom was the smallest thing...

248
00:12:43 --> 00:12:47
...until you split it openand this whole mess of crap came out.

249
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
Are you telling me that you areso unbelievably arrogant...

250
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
...that you can't admit thatthere's a teeny, tiny possibility...

251
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
...that you could be wrong about this?

252
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
There might be...

253
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
...a teeny...

254
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
...tiny...

255
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
...possibility.

256
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
I can't believe you caved.

257
00:13:16 --> 00:13:20
You just abandonedyour whole belief system!

258
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
Before, I didn't agree with you,but at least I respected you.

259
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
But...

260
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
How are you gonna gointo work tomorrow?

261
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
How are you going to facethe other science guys?

262
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
How are you going to face yourself?

263
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
That was fun.So who's hungry?

264
00:13:46 --> 00:13:46
I am.

265
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
Me too.Let me just get my coat.

266
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
What happened?

267
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
It was an accident, I swear.

268
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
I was putting on my jacket andthe thing and the lamp and it broke.

269
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
Oh, please, Monica!You've always hated my lamp!

270
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
And now all of a sudden,it's just magically, it's just broken?

271
00:14:09 --> 00:14:10
Phoebe, tell her?

272
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
I didn't see it, becauseI was putting on my jacket.

273
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
But I want to believe you.

274
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
Hey, Chandler. Monica justbroke my seashell lamp.

275
00:14:21 --> 00:14:22
Neat.

276
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
I'm gonna die alone!

277
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
Okay, you win.

278
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
Chandler, you are notgonna die alone.

279
00:14:30 --> 00:14:31
Janice was my safety net, okay?

280
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
And now I have to get a snake.

281
00:14:35 --> 00:14:36
Why is that?

282
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,I'm gonna need a thing.

283
00:14:39 --> 00:14:40
You know, a hook.

284
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
Like that guy on the subwaywho eats his own face.

285
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
So I figure I'll be"Crazy Man With A Snake."

286
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
Crazy Snake Man.

287
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
Then I'll get more snakes,call them my babies.

288
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
Kids will run past my place!

289
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man",they'll shout!

290
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
You've got to get over this.

291
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
You won't end up alone.

292
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
Of course I will.

293
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
I reject anyone who's crazy enoughto actually go out with me...

294
00:15:03 --> 00:15:08
...and then I bitch that therearen't any great women out there.

295
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
You have just described...

296
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
...virtually every manthat we've ever gone out with.

297
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
You are not a freak.You're a guy.

298
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
She's right.

299
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
You're no different than the rest.

300
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
Wait a minute, wait a minute.Yes, he is.

301
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
You are totally different.

302
00:15:23 --> 00:15:24
In a bad way?

303
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
No, honey, in a wonderful way.

304
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
You know what you want now.

305
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
Most guys don't even have a clue.

306
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
You're ready to take risks, bevulnerable and intimate with someone.

307
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
You're not gonna end up alone.

308
00:15:35 --> 00:15:40
You called Janice. That's how muchyou wanted to be with someone!

309
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
- You've made it!- You're there!

310
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
You are ready to make a commitment!

311
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
Don't know about that!

312
00:15:52 --> 00:15:52
What you got there?

313
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
Something else that's not yoursthat you can break?

314
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
I know you like thisand I want you to have it.

315
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
It'll look good in our apartment.

316
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
Thank you.

317
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
That's fine.

318
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
You'll all be pleased to knowthat I have a date tomorrow night.

319
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
This woman Allison from work.She is great.

320
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
She's pretty, she's smart.And I've been...

321
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
...holding off asking her outin the past, because she has a...

322
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
...unusually large head.

323
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
But I'm not going to letthat stuff hang me up anymore.

324
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
Look at me. I'm growing.

325
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
You can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

326
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
I'll take that.

327
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
You want his yearbook?

328
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
Some people said nice things about him.Somebody should have it.

329
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
Gosh, this is so weird.

330
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
His whole life was inthis apartment and now it's gone.

331
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
I think it would be nice if we justtook a few moments for Mr. Heckles.

332
00:16:50 --> 00:16:55
He was kind of a pain.He was, but he was a person.

333
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
You're all going to hell.

334
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
It's really not that big!

335
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
- Taking that with you, huh?- Oh, yeah.

336
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
You coming?

337
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
In a second.

338
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

339
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
We'll try to keep it down.

340
00:17:42 --> 00:17:43
My major was useless.

341
00:17:43 --> 00:17:47
How often do you look in the classifiedsand see "Philosopher Wanted"?

342
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
Sure.

343
00:17:48 --> 00:17:51
My God, that's a big head!

344
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
Maybe it's the lighting.

345
00:17:55 --> 00:17:58
like a golf ball at work.

346
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
List five things you like about her.

347
00:18:01 --> 00:18:03
Nice smile, good dresser.

348
00:18:03 --> 00:18:06
Big head, big head, big head!
