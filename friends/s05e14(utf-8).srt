1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:07
Guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy'sputting stuff in boxes.

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
I'd say our naked buddy is moving.

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:15
Ironically, most of the boxesseem to be labeled "Clothes".

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
I'm going to miss that bigold squishy butt.

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
And we're donewith the chicken fried rice.

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
If he's moving, maybe I shouldtry to get his place!

7
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
It would be so coolto live across from you guys.

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
We could do that telephone thing...

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
...where you have a can,we have a can...

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
...and it's connected by a string.

11
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
Or we could dothe actual telephone thing.

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
The One WhereEveryone Finds Out

13
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
Oh, my God. I love this apartment!

14
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
Isn't it perfect?

15
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
I can't believe I never realizedhow great it is!

16
00:01:21 --> 00:01:24
Because your eye goesto the big naked man.

17
00:01:25 --> 00:01:26
It's amazing!

18
00:01:26 --> 00:01:29
Hurry up with an application,or I'll beat you to it.

19
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
Well, I'm going to useUgly Naked Guy's bathroom.

20
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
Look! There's Monica and Chandler.

21
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
Hey, you guys!

22
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
Chandler and Monica!

23
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
Oh, my God!

24
00:01:58 --> 00:01:58
Oh, my eyes!

25
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
My eyes!

26
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
It's okay!

27
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
- They're doing it!- I know!

28
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
- I know!- You know?

29
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
Yes, I know it. Joey knows,but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!

30
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
What's going on?

31
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
- What?- Nothing!

32
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
We are so excitedthat you'll get this apartment!

33
00:02:17 --> 00:02:17
Looks really good.

34
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
Looks pretty good!

35
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
Get in here!Come on!

36
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
You mean wheneverMonica and Chandler...

37
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
...were doing laundryor going grocery shopping?

38
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
The time Monica spent on the phonewith Linda from camp?

39
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.

40
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
I can't believe it!

41
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
I think it's great. For him.

42
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
She could do better.

43
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
Hey, you guys.

44
00:02:45 --> 00:02:46
Come here!

45
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Phoebe found outabout Monica and Chandler.

46
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
You mean how they're friendsand nothing more?

47
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
Joey, she knows.

48
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
We saw them doing itthrough the window.

49
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
Actually, we saw them doing itup against the window.

50
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
So they know you know,and they don't know Rachel knows?

51
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
Yes, but it doesn't matterwho knows what.

52
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
Now enough of us knowthat we could just tell them we know.

53
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
All the lying and the secretswill finally be over.

54
00:03:11 --> 00:03:16
Or, we could not tell them we know,and have a little fun.

55
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
What do you mean?

56
00:03:17 --> 00:03:22
If they say they are doing laundry,we'll give them laundry to do.

57
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
I would enjoy that.

58
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
You know what would be even more fun?Telling them.

59
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.

60
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
I can't take...

61
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
You don't have to do anything.Just don't tell them we know.

62
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
I can't take anymore secrets.

63
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
I got your secrets, their secrets,secrets of my own.

64
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
You don't have any secrets.

65
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,my bedtime penguin pal.

66
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
How are we going to mess with them?

67
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
You could use your positionas the roommate.

68
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
And I would use the strongest toolat my disposal.

69
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
My sexuality.

70
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
Hello, children.

71
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
Watch. Learn.And don't eat my cookie.

72
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
That jacket looks great on you.

73
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
- Really?- The material is so soft.

74
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
Hello, Mr. Bicep.

75
00:04:15 --> 00:04:16
You're working out?

76
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
I try to squeeze things.

77
00:04:23 --> 00:04:24
Are you okay?

78
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
If you really want to know...

79
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
I can't tell you this.

80
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
You can tell me anything.

81
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
Actually, you are the one personI can't tell this to.

82
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
And the one person I want to the most.

83
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
What's going on?

84
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
I just haven't beenwith a guy in so long...

85
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
...and sometimes you'relooking for something...

86
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
...and it's right therein front of you, sipping coffee...

87
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

88
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
Just something to think about.I know I will.

89
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
You are so cute.

90
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
How did you get to be so cute?

91
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
My grandfather was Swedish.

92
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
And my grandmother wasa tiny little bunny.

93
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
Now you're even cuter.

94
00:05:15 --> 00:05:19
You know, that is a popularopinion today, I must say.

95
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
The weirdest thing happenedat the coffeehouse.

96
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
Phoebe was hitting on me.

97
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

99
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
It's not possible.

100
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
I'm sorry, Phoebe's justalways thought you were charming...

101
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
...in a sexless kind of way.

102
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
You know, I can't hear that enough.

103
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
I just think you misunderstood her.

104
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
I didn't, okay?She was all over me.

105
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
She touched my bicep,for crying out loud.

106
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
This bicep?

107
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
Well, it's not flexed right now.

108
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
Mon, you want to comesee a movie with us?

109
00:06:00 --> 00:06:04
Actually, I was goingto do some laundry.

110
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
Want to do it with me?

111
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
Sure, I'll do it with you.

112
00:06:08 --> 00:06:12
Okay, great.Hold on a second.

113
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Here you go.

114
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
That would really help me out a lot.Thanks.

115
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
You know what?I don't have enough quarters.

116
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
I have quarters!

117
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?

118
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
I called there, and it turns outNaked Guy is subletting it.

119
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
He's already had 100 applicants.

120
00:06:32 --> 00:06:33
No, I've got the edge.

121
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
It's not exactly ethical,but I sent him a bribe...

122
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
...to tip the scales in my direction.

123
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
You can see it from the window.

124
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
Is it that pinball machinewith the big bow on it?

125
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
That new mountain bike?

126
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
What did you send?

127
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
A basket of mini muffins.

128
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
There's a whole table of them.Which one did you send?

129
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
The small one.

130
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
You actually thought that basketwas going to get you the apartment?

131
00:07:04 --> 00:07:08
Someone sent us a basket at work, andpeople went crazy over those muffins.

132
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
It was the best day.

133
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
Your work makes me sad.

134
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
Oh, man, I want that place so much!

135
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
And I was so surethat was going to work.

136
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
There's 12 bucksI'll never see again.

137
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
We'd better go if we wantto catch that movie.

138
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
Bye.

139
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
Bye, Chandler.I miss you already.

140
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
Did you see that? The inappropriate,and the pinching?

141
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
Actually, I did.

142
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
So do you believethat she's attracted to me?

143
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Oh, my God!She knows about us!

144
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
Are you serious?

145
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
She knows, and she's tryingto freak us out!

146
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
That's the only explanation!

147
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
But what about my pinchable buttand my bulging biceps?

148
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
She knows!

149
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
Phoebe knows about us.

150
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
I didn't tell them!

151
00:08:05 --> 00:08:06
Them?

152
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Who's "them"?

153
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
Phoebe and Joey.

154
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
And Rachel.

155
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
I would have told you,but I promised not to tell.

156
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:18 --> 00:08:19
But it's over now, right?

158
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
You can tell them you know they know,and I can go back to knowing nothing!

159
00:08:24 --> 00:08:25
Unless...

160
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
Not "unless"!This must end now!

161
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
They think they are so slickmessing with us.

162
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
But they don't knowthat we know that they know.

163
00:08:35 --> 00:08:35
So...

164
00:08:35 --> 00:08:40
The messers become the messees!

165
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
Honey, you got to stoptorturing yourself.

166
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
Why don't you find another apartment?

167
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
I've already lookedat 1000 apartments this month.

168
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
None of them even comparesto that one.

169
00:08:50 --> 00:08:51
You know what?

170
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
You should find out his hobbiesand use that to bond with him.

171
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
Like if I wanted something from Joey...

172
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
...I would strike up a conversationabout sandwiches...

173
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
...or my underwear.

174
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
I'm listening.

175
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
That is a great idea!

176
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
And I know Ugly Naked Guy becausewe've been watching him for five years.

177
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
So that gives me back my edge!

178
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
Let's see now.He had the trampoline.

179
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
He broke that.

180
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
- He had gravity boots.- He broke those too.

181
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
So he likes to break stuff.

182
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
I've got to go pick up Ben.But I will figure something out.

183
00:09:31 --> 00:09:32
Didn't he used to have a cat?

184
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
I wouldn't bring that up.It would bum him out.

185
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
Poor cat never sawthat big butt coming.

186
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
Hold on a second,she's right here.

187
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
It's Chandler.

188
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
Hello, you.

189
00:09:49 --> 00:09:53
Phoebe, I've been thinkingabout you all day.

190
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
You know that thing you said before?I was intrigued.

191
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
Really?

192
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
Joey won't be here tonight.

193
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
Why don't you come over?I'll let you feel my bicep.

194
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
Or maybe more.

195
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
I'll have to get back to you on that.

196
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
He wants me to come overand feel his bicep and more!

197
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
Are you kidding?

198
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
I cannot believehe would do that to Mon...

199
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
Joey? Do they know that we know?

200
00:10:29 --> 00:10:29
They know you know.

201
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
I knew it!

202
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
I cannot believe those two!

203
00:10:33 --> 00:10:38
They thought they could mess with us?Trying to mess with us?

204
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
They don't know that we knowthey know we know.

205
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
Joey, you can't say anything.

206
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
Couldn't if I wanted to.

207
00:10:51 --> 00:10:55
Good evening, sir. I'm Ross Geller.I'm one of the applicants.

208
00:10:55 --> 00:11:00
I realize that the competitionis fierce but...

209
00:11:00 --> 00:11:05
I'm sorry, I can't help but noticethat you're naked.

210
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
I applaud you.

211
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
Man, I wish I was naked.

212
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
I mean, this looks so great.

213
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
That is how God intended it.

214
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
Look. They're panicked!

215
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
They'll totally back down.

216
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
If he wants a date,he's going to get a date.

217
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25

257
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08

270
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the soonerit's over and out in the open.

271
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50

272
00:14:50 --> 00:14:55
Show him your bra.He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

273
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
You didn't rip off any buttons.

274
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
It's not my first time.

275
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07

00:17:00 --> 00:17:01
Actually, Ross doesn't.

307
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
We'd appreciate itif no one told him yet.

308
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
A new place for a new Ross.

309
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
I'll have you and the guys from workover, once it's furnished.

310
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
It's nice to see youback on your feet.

311
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
I am that, and the whole rage thingis definitely behind me.

312
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
I wonder if it's time for youto rejoin our museum team?

313
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
That would be great.

314
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
I am totally readyto come back to work.
