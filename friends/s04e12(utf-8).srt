1
00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
What the hell is that?

2
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
What the hell is that?Is that you?

3
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
- You're really not a morning person.- Just back off!

4
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
Get up! Get up! Get up!

5
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
What is that noise?

6
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
You!

7
00:00:39 --> 00:00:40
It's the chick.

8
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
She's going through some changes.

9
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
What kind of changes?

10
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
The vet seems to think...

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
...she's becoming a rooster.

12
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
We're getting a second opinion.

13
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
The One with the Embryos

14
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
Why are you shoppingat eight in the morning?

15
00:01:35 --> 00:01:36
I've been up since six...

16
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
...thanks to somebody'sdumb-ass rooster.

17
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
You should get rid of those animals.They shouldn't be in an apartment.

18
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
Especially not with theseknives and cookbooks around.

19
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
I'm going to the doctorand see if I'm ready...

20
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
...to have Frank and Alice's embryotransferred into my uterus.

21
00:01:54 --> 00:01:55
How will they know?

22
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
They'll just see if myendometrial layer is thick.

23
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
I can check that for you.

24
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
Okay, think "thick".

25
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
Good luck!

26
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
Wish me luck.

27
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
Good luck.

28
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
- I'm still right.- That is so not true.

29
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
What?

30
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
I know it's her laundry day...

31
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
...and that means she's wearingher old-lady underpants.

32
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
I can check that for you.

33
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
You two think you knowme and Rachel...

34
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
...better than we know you.

35
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
Well, we do.

36
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
You can only eat Tic Tacsin even numbers.

37
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
What's that about?

38
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
And you!Ross, if you check Rachel's bag...

39
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
...you'll find a half-eaten boxof cookies in there.

40
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
You're good.

41
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
These are not.

42
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
I'm so not impressed.Everybody snacks when they shop.

43
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
Ross, how many itemsleft in that bag?

44
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
Five.

45
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
Okay, ten bucks says we canname every item in that bag.

46
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
How many guesses?

47
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
Six.

48
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Challenge extended.

49
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
- Deal!- Challenge accepted.

50
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
All right, we'll start with...

51
00:03:05 --> 00:03:06
...apples.

52
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
We'll be starting with apples.

53
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
Stop that now.

54
00:03:13 --> 00:03:14
Yes.

55
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
Okay. Tortilla chips.

56
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
- Yogurt.- Diet soda.

57
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
- Orange juice.- There's no orange juice! We win!

58
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
They have another guess.

59
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
Well, we won that one.

60
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
Okay. The last thing is...

61
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
Not for another two weeks.

62
00:03:39 --> 00:03:39
I got it.

63
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
Scotch...

64
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
...tape.

65
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
How did you knowshe would buy Scotch tape?

66
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
We used up theirs last nightmaking scary faces.

67
00:03:52 --> 00:03:53
Oh, man!

68
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
All right! Ten bucks.Fork it over.

69
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
Cough it up. Pay the piper.

70
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
Give me it!

71
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
You don't know us better.I want a rematch.

72
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
And no stupid grocery questions.Real personal questions.

73
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
And the winner gets $100.

74
00:04:08 --> 00:04:09
Serious?

75
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
Are you scared?

76
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
No.

77
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
Who makes up the questions?

78
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
Ross will do it.

79
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Sure, Ross will do it.

80
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
It's not like he has a jobor a child or a life of his own.

81
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Fine. We'll ask Phoebe.

82
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
No, I want to play.

83
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
Looks like your uterusis ready for implantation.

84
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
I knew it!I felt really thick this morning.

85
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
Okay, so what's now?Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

86
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
It'll take a little whileto prepare the embryos.

87
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
- Embryos? As in more than one?- Five, actually.

88
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
Where am I giving birth...

89
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
...in a hospital ora big box under the stairs?

90
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
Doing five gives you a 25% chancethat at least one will attach.

91
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
That's it? 25%?

92
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
That means that it's, like,75% chance of no baby at all?

93
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
I was thinking,what are the odds...

94
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
...if you stuff 200 of them in there?

95
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
Sweetie, now...

96
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
...she's a woman,not a gumball machine.

97
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
Don't worry. I'll do this as manytimes as it takes to get it right.

98
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
The thing is, we kind ofonly have one shot.

99
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
It costs $16,000 each time you do this.

100
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
We're kind of using all the moneywe have to do it this one time.

101
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
Okay, that's a lot ofpressure on me and my uterus.

102
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
Maybe there's something I can doto make sure I get pregnant.

103
00:05:34 --> 00:05:35
No, I'm sorry.

104
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
Wow, you guys reallydon't know anything.

105
00:05:39 --> 00:05:44
Why don't she get drunk? It workedfor a bunch of girls in my high school.

106
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
Do you realize thatany minute now...

107
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
...Phoebe could be pregnant?

108
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
I know, I know.

109
00:05:52 --> 00:05:56
It's such a huge,life-altering thing.

110
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
The test is ready.

111
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
Okay. Each team willanswer 10 questions.

112
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
The first team to answerthe most questions wins.

113
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
The categories are"Fears And Pet Peeves"...

114
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
..."Ancient History"...

115
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
..."Literature"...

116
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
...and "It's All Relative".

117
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
Now...

118
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
...the coin toss,to see who goes first.

119
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
Somebody call it this time.

120
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
Tails!

121
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
It's heads.

122
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Gentlemen, pick your category.

123
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
"Fears And Pet Peeves."

124
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"

125
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
- Animals dressed as humans.- Correct.

126
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
Ladies?

127
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
Same category.

128
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
"According to Chandler, what phenomenonscares the bejesus out of him?"

129
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!

130
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
Correct.

131
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
The Irish jig guy?

132
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
His legs flail aboutas if independent from his body!

133
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
Gentlemen, your pick.

134
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
"It's All Relative."

135
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
"Monica and I hada grandmother who died."

136
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
"You both went to her funeral."

137
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
"Name that grandmother."

138
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
Nana?

139
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
She has a real name.

140
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
Althea!

141
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
- What?- I took a shot!

142
00:07:22 --> 00:07:22
With Althea?

143
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
- Althea is correct.- Nice shooting!

144
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
"Literature."

145
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
"Every week the "TV Guide" comesto Chandler and Joey's apartment."

146
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
"What name appearson the address label?"

147
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
Chandler gets it!It's Chandler Bing!

148
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
I'm afraid the "TV Guide"comes to "Chanandler Bong".

149
00:07:44 --> 00:07:45
I knew that!

150
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
Rachel, use your head!

151
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
Actually, it's Miss Chanandler Bong.

152
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
Hello, teeny embryos.

153
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi!

154
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
I'm hoping to be your uterusfor the next nine months.

155
00:08:07 --> 00:08:08
We're doing thisfor Frank and Alice...

156
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
...who you know.You've been there.

157
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
They want you so much.

158
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
So when you guys get in there,really grab on.

159
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
And I promise that I'll keep yousafe and warm...

160
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
...until you're readyto have them take you home.

161
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
Next time you see me,if I'm screaming, don't worry.

162
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
That's what's supposed to happen.

163
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
Ready?

164
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
Good luck!

165
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
The score is nine to eightin favor of the guys.

166
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
Ladies, if you miss this,the game is theirs. Pick a category.

167
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
"It's All Relative!"

168
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
- You don't have to shout everything.- I'm sorry!

169
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
"What is the nameof Chandler's father's...

170
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
...Las Vegas all-male burlesque?"

171
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
Viva Las Gaygas!

172
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
Unfortunately, that is correct.

173
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
All right. We have a tie.

174
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
Luckily, I've preparedfor such an event.

175
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
The Lightning Round!

176
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
Thirty seconds.All the questions you can answer.

177
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
You guys are dead!

178
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
I am so good at Lightning Rounds!

179
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
I majored in Lightning Rounds,all right?

180
00:09:26 --> 00:09:27
We'll destroy you.

181
00:09:27 --> 00:09:28
Want to bet?

182
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
I'm so confused as to whatwe've been doing so far.

183
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
How about we play for more money?Say 150?

184
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
One hundred and fifty dollars.

185
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
Say 200?

186
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
Two hundred dollars!

187
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
You're doing it again.

188
00:09:44 --> 00:09:45
Excuse me.

189
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
- I don't want to lose $200.- We won't.

190
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
Three hundred?

191
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
I'm spicing it up!

192
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
So play for some pepper!Stop spending my money.

193
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
I got it!

194
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
If we win, they have toget rid of the rooster.

195
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
That's interesting!

196
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
No way! That rooster's family.

197
00:10:03 --> 00:10:03
The duck too!

198
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
The duck doesn't make noise!

199
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
He gets the other one all riled up!

200
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
- We are not...- All right, hold on!

201
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
If you win...

202
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
...we give up the bird.

203
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
But if we win...

204
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
...we get your apartment.

205
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
Deal!

206
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
Betting the apartment?I don't know about this.

207
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
I have not missed one questionthe whole game. I own this game!

208
00:10:33 --> 00:10:33
Look at my hand.

209
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
You have the answers written there?

210
00:10:36 --> 00:10:40
No. Steady as a rock.Now are you with me?

211
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
All right, let's do it!

212
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
All right.Gentlemen, you're up first.

213
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
You have 30 seconds.

214
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
The Lightning Round begins...

215
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Stop it!

216
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
"Monica's nicknamewhen she was a hockey goalie?"

217
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
- Big Fat Goalie.- Correct!

218
00:10:59 --> 00:11:00
"Rachel claimsit's her favorite movie."

219
00:11:01 --> 00:11:02
Dangerous Liaisons.

220
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
- Weekend at Bernie's.

221
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
"In what part of her body did Monicaget a pencil stuck at age 14?"

00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
That's four for the guys.Ladies, you're up!

232
00:11:40 --> 00:11:41
Thirty seconds on the clock.

242
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

243

244
00:12:07 --> 00:12:08
- And processing!- He carries a briefcase.

245
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
Ten seconds.You need this or you lose.

246
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
Something to dowith transponding.

247
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
He's a transponster!

248
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
That's not even a word!

249
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
I can get this! I can get this!

250
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37

00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
I'm in sight of the roomand I called it.

253
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
Damn!

254
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
I feel like I'm coming downwith something.

255
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
Guess the color of my tonsils.I bet the apartment!

256
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
I would never bet this place.It's too nice.

257
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
Are they in there?

258
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
Yeah, I'm implanted.

259
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
How do you feel?

260
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
Well, freaked.

261
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
It turns out the oddsare really sucky.

262
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
And this isFrank and Alice's only shot.

263
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
They are literally puttingall their eggs in my basket.

264
00:13:11 --> 00:13:12
But I bet it works.

265
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
Really? How much?

266
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
I'm going to takea pregnancy test now.

267
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
Wow! You can tell this soon?

268
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
The doctor says it takes a few days.

269
00:13:21 --> 00:13:26
But my body's always been a littlefaster than Western medicine.

270
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
I can't believe you guys thinkyou're moving in here.

271
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
Well, believe it, baby!

272
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
Well, I'm not moving.

273
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
What?

274
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
No. It was a stupid bet.We were just playing a game.

275
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
You can't ignore the bet.It's a bet!

276
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
Bet on a betand if you lose, you lose the bet.

277
00:13:45 --> 00:13:45
We have to move.

278
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
We would have made themget rid of the birds.

279
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
I hate this as much as you,but if it makes you feel better...

280
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
...this is all your fault.

281
00:13:58 --> 00:13:58

282
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
Chanandler Bong!We steal that "TV Guide" every week!

283
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
I knew it!

284
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
I don't care.I'm not going anywhere.

285
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
Cool! Girl roommate.

286
00:14:11 --> 00:14:12
Well?

287
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
Nope, not knocked up yet.

288
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
It's only been a couple hours.

289
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
Meanwhile, I'll dowhatever I can to help this.

290
00:14:19 --> 00:14:23
I'm just going to, you know,lie in your chair, okay?

291
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
Good. I'm goingto let gravity do its jobs.

292
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
Can you give me a hand?

293
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
Put that box down!We are not going anywhere!

294
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
This is my apartment and I like it!

295
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
This is a girl's apartment!

296
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
That is a boy's apartment!It's dirty and it smells!

297
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
This is pretty!It's so pretty!

298
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
And look, it's purple!

299
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
I tell you, you with yoursteady hand, I am not moving.

300
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
And now I have got the steady hand.

301
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
- I'll take care of it.- That's right.

302
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
You do what the hand says!

303
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
- How'd it go?- I lost our mattresses.

304
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
In nine months will you come greet us?

305
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
I will buy you some Adidas

306
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
We were just at the drugstoreso we got you a little present.

307
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
It's a lollipopand a home pregnancy test.

308
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
Don't mix those up.You could really ruin that lollipop.

309
00:15:41 --> 00:15:46
You feel like taking a test?There's only one question.

310
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
All right. I will.

311
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
Remember thatit's still really early.

312
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
If it says I'm not pregnant,that doesn't mean I won't get pregnant.

313
00:15:54 --> 00:15:57
Just so I don't go completely nuts...

314
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
...try not to putall your hopes on this.

315
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
Great.

316
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
You are mean boyswho are just being mean!

317
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
Don't get mad! No oneforced you to raise the stakes.

318
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
That is not true!She forced me!

319
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
You got the question wrong.

320
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
It was a stupid, unfair question!

321
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
Don't blame the questions!

322
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
Stop yelling in our apartment!You are ruining moving day for us.

323
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
- Stop calling it your apartment!- It is!

324
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
You're going to have a baby.They're going to have a baby!

325
00:16:40 --> 00:16:44
My sister's going to have my baby!

326
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
Okay, but this can'tbe good for the baby.

327
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
I can't find garbage bags.

328
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
I think I saw some in here.

329
00:17:09 --> 00:17:10
What is it?

330
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
I don't know. But maybe if we keepthat drawer shut, it'll die.

331
00:17:15 --> 00:17:18
I can't believe we're living here!

332
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
What is it?

333
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
Did you see the size of the closets?

334
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
I can't believe we live here!
