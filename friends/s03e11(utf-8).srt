00:00:03.64,00:00:06.16

17

Okay, pick a card.[br]Any card.

18



19

00:00:06.40,00:00:08.84

20

All right, now memorize it.

21



22

00:00:09.04,00:00:11.24

23

Show it to everybody.

24



25

00:00:11.48,00:00:12.28

26

Got it?

27



28

00:00:12.52,00:00:14.44

29

All right.[br]Give it back to me.

30



31

00:00:19.60,00:00:20.75

32

Five of hearts.

33



34

00:00:21.72,00:00:23.84

35

Real magic does exist.

36



37

00:00:24.32,00:00:25.84

38

Joey, how do you do it?

39



40

00:00:26.08,00:00:27.40

41

I can't tell you that.

42



43

00:00:30.92,00:00:33.44

44

Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.

45



46

00:00:34.12,00:00:36.72

47

That's our unbelievably loud[br]upstairs neighbor.

48



49

00:00:36.92,00:00:39.48

50

He took up the carpets,[br]and now you can hear everything.

51



52

00:00:39.68,00:00:43.07

53

Why don't you go ask him[br]to just, "Step lightly, please?"

54



55

00:00:44.08,00:00:46.96

56

I have, like five times.[br]But the guy is so charming. . .

57



58

00:00:47.20,00:00:50.24

59

. . .I go up there to yell,[br]then I end up apologizing to him.

60



61

00:00:50.44,00:00:52.32

62

That is silly!

63



64

00:00:53.12,00:00:55.08

65

I'll go up and tell him[br]to keep it down.

66



67

00:00:55.40,00:00:57.12

68

-All right, be my guest.[br]-Good luck.

69



70

00:00:57.32,00:00:58.28

71

All right, all right. . .

72



73

00:00:58.52,00:01:01.04

74

. . .if you wanna know how I did it,[br]I'll show you.

75



76

00:01:01.84,00:01:04.92

77

When you handed me back the card,[br]what you didn't see was. . .

78



79

00:01:05.12,00:01:08.48

80

. . .I looked at it so fast,[br]it was invisible to the naked eye.

81



82

00:01:10.36,00:01:11.64

83

I just did it.

84



85

00:01:12.44,00:01:13.56

86

Just did it again.

87



88

00:01:15.04,00:01:18.04

89

Here, I'll slow it down[br]so you guys can see it. Ready?

90



91

00:01:19.88,00:01:21.72

92

-I got it now![br]-Okay.

93



94

00:01:39.52,00:01:40.67

95

Thank you.

103

00:02:31.52,00:02:35.44

104

Anybody got a length of rope about[br]6 feet long, with a noose at the end?

105



106

00:02:35.64,00:02:38.64

107

-Honey, what's the matter?[br]-I just saw Janice.

108



109

00:02:38.88,00:02:43.80

110

She was at Rockefeller Center, skating[br]with her husband. She looked so happy.

111



112

00:02:44.00,00:02:47.24

113

I almost feel bad for whipping[br]that kid's pretzel at them.

114



115

00:02:48.80,00:02:51.68

116

I remember the first time I saw[br]Katherine after we broke up.

117



118

00:02:51.88,00:02:54.68

119

She was walking and talking[br]with her friend, Donna.

120



121

00:02:54.92,00:02:56.32

122

God, it killed me!

123



124

00:02:57.08,00:03:00.60

125

But you ended up having sex[br]with both of them that afternoon.

126



127

00:03:02.00,00:03:04.56

128

Sorry, I just--[br]Any excuse to tell that story.

129



130

00:03:06.80,00:03:09.84

131

There's a party tomorrow.[br]You'll feel better then.

132



133

00:03:10.08,00:03:13.44

134

I'm gonna be okay. You don't[br]have to throw a party for me.

135



136

00:03:13.64,00:03:15.44

137

It's Joey's birthday.

138



139

00:03:16.32,00:03:19.04

140

Then if anybody should have a party,[br]it should be him.

141



142

00:03:22.40,00:03:25.24

143

I cannot believe[br]she's still up there.

144



145

00:03:33.68,00:03:36.28

146

Well, he totally[br]screwed up the punch line.

147



148

00:03:36.52,00:03:38.28

149

You know, it's supposed to be--

150



151

00:03:45.60,00:03:47.08

152

How's that coffee coming, dear?

153



154

00:03:47.32,00:03:48.80

155

Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

156



157

00:03:49.00,00:03:51.60

158

I'm not suppose to drink it.[br]It makes me gassy.

159



160

00:03:53.32,00:03:54.44

161

I know.

162



163

00:03:56.04,00:03:59.04

164

I'll bet you're thinking,[br]"What's an intelligent girl. . .

165



166

00:03:59.24,00:04:01.92

167

. . .who wants to be in fashion[br]doing making coffee?"

168



169

00:04:03.08,00:04:04.23

170

You got me.

171



172

00:04:04.96,00:04:07.08

173

Don't think I haven't noticed[br]your potential.

174



175

00:04:07.32,00:04:11.28

176

I've got a project for you[br]that's a lot more related to fashion.

177



178

00:04:11.48,00:04:13.87

179

-How does that sound?[br]-That sounds great!

180



181

00:04:14.12,00:04:17.08

182

-Come on over here, sweetheart.[br]-Thank you so much.

183



184

00:04:17.32,00:04:20.92

185

I need these hangers separated[br]ASAP.

186



187

00:04:23.24,00:04:24.23

188

You're welcome.

189



190

00:04:28.68,00:04:30.99

191

Oh, God, I hate my job![br]I hate it.

192



193

00:04:31.20,00:04:32.68

194

I know, honey. I'm sorry.

195



196

00:04:32.88,00:04:36.16

197

I want to quit, but then I think I[br]should stick it out.

198



199

00:04:36.40,00:04:37.39

200

Then I think:

201



202

00:04:37.72,00:04:40.68

203

"Why would a person stay[br]in such a demeaning job. . .

204



205

00:04:40.92,00:04:45.24

206

. . .just because it's remotely related[br]to the field they're interested in?

207



208

00:04:46.80,00:04:48.36

209

Gee, I don't know, Rach.

210



211

00:04:48.60,00:04:52.28

212

Order up! Yentl soup, James Beans,[br]and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

213



214

00:04:53.12,00:04:54.96

215

Come on, I'm sorry.[br]I didn't--

216



217

00:04:55.20,00:04:56.68

218

I don't mind paying my dues.

219



220

00:04:56.88,00:04:59.00

221

But how much[br]will I learn about fashion. . .

222



223

00:04:59.20,00:05:01.43

224

. . .by walking Myra,[br]the arthritic seamstress. . .

225



226

00:05:01.64,00:05:03.64

227

. . .to the bathroom?

228



229

00:05:05.48,00:05:06.28

230

Hi.

231



232

00:05:06.52,00:05:08.40

233

Is my misery amusing to you?

234



235

00:05:08.88,00:05:10.84

236

I'm sorry, I was just. . . .

237



238

00:05:11.48,00:05:13.48

239

It's not funny.[br]This is actually my job.

240



241

00:05:13.68,00:05:15.08

242

Believe me, I've been there.

243



244

00:05:15.32,00:05:18.84

245

I had to sort mannequin heads[br]at that Mannequins Plus.

246



247

00:05:19.48,00:05:22.84

248

I'm just gonna go back[br]to talking to my friend here.

249



250

00:05:23.08,00:05:25.84

251

You can go back to enjoying[br]your little hamburger.

252



253

00:05:27.32,00:05:29.52

254

Just one other thing.

255



256

00:05:30.68,00:05:32.04

257

I work at Bloomingdale's.

258



259

00:05:32.28,00:05:35.44

260

I might know of a possible job,[br]if you're interested.

261



262

00:05:38.40,00:05:39.60

263

Do you want my pickle?

264



265

00:05:46.48,00:05:47.28

266

Hey, guys.

267



268

00:05:47.52,00:05:48.72

269

-Hey, Gunther.[br]-Hi.

270



271

00:05:48.92,00:05:51.39

272

You're going on a date[br]with the noisy guy upstairs?

273



274

00:05:51.60,00:05:53.64

275

Well, he's very charming.

276



277

00:05:54.08,00:05:55.04

278

He's too charming!

279



280

00:05:55.28,00:05:58.40

281

But if you go out,[br]it'll be harder for me to hate him.

282



283

00:05:58.72,00:06:00.28

284

You'll just have to try.

285



286

00:06:02.44,00:06:04.36

287

Joey? Where are the Jell-O shots?

288



289

00:06:04.60,00:06:07.64

290

I don't know. Chandler's[br]supposed to be passing them--

291



292

00:06:08.32,00:06:09.44

293

Chandler!

294



295

00:06:09.68,00:06:11.04

296

Hello-dee-lo!

297



298

00:06:12.08,00:06:14.04

299

Well, somebody's feeling better.

300



301

00:06:15.24,00:06:17.47

302

-Stick out your tongue![br]-Take off your shirt!

303



304

00:06:21.12,00:06:22.88

305

-Oh, my![br]-Oh, my God!

306



307

00:06:23.08,00:06:25.55

308

How many did you have?[br]They're pure vodka.

309



310

00:06:25.76,00:06:28.44

311

Yeah, Jell-O.[br]Just like Mom used to make.

312



313

00:06:30.16,00:06:32.63

314

The most unbelievable thing[br]happened today.

315



316

00:06:34.52,00:06:36.67

317

I had lunch at Monica's[br]and met a guy. . .

318



319

00:06:36.88,00:06:38.88

320

. . .who works for a buyer[br]at Bloomingdale's.

321



322

00:06:39.12,00:06:42.67

323

There's an opening there![br]So I gave him my phone number. . .

324



325

00:06:42.92,00:06:46.23

326

. . .and he'll call me this weekend[br]to get me an interview!

327



328

00:06:47.84,00:06:51.23

329

So this guy's helping you[br]for no apparent reason?

330



331

00:06:52.80,00:06:55.27

332

And he's a total stranger?

333



334

00:06:55.48,00:06:58.28

335

Yeah. His name is "Mark" something.

336



337

00:06:58.52,00:07:01.83

338

Sounds like "Mark Something"[br]wants to have some sex!

339



340

00:07:02.92,00:07:03.88

341

What?

342



343

00:07:04.76,00:07:08.64

344

Why else would he swoop[br]in out of nowhere for no reason?

345



346

00:07:09.32,00:07:10.39

347

To be nice?

348



349

00:07:10.64,00:07:14.35

350

Hey, Joey, are men ever nice[br]to strange women for no reason?

351



352

00:07:14.60,00:07:16.00

353

-No, only for sex.[br]-Thank you.

354



355

00:07:18.68,00:07:21.99

356

So did you tell[br]"Mark Something" about me?

357



358

00:07:22.80,00:07:24.84

359

I didn't have to.[br]I was wearing. . .

360



361

00:07:25.04,00:07:28.43

362

. . .my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board[br]and ringing my bell.

363



364

00:07:30.28,00:07:33.20

365

Joey![br]Happy birthday!

366



367

00:07:36.96,00:07:39.92

368

How many of that girl are you seeing?

369



370

00:07:42.24,00:07:45.08

371

How hammered are you?[br]These are Joey's sisters.

372



373

00:07:45.32,00:07:46.88

374

Hi, Joey's sisters!

375



376

00:07:48.52,00:07:49.96

377

What're we drinking over here?

378



379

00:07:50.28,00:07:53.24

380

Well, I have a vodka[br]and cranberry juice.

381



382

00:07:53.44,00:07:54.24

383

No kidding?

384



385

00:07:54.48,00:07:58.16

386

That's the same drink I made myself[br]right after I shot my husband.

387



388

00:08:01.48,00:08:03.76

389

Okay, I don't know how[br]to talk to you.

390



391

00:08:05.40,00:08:06.68

392

What are you doing?

393



394

00:08:07.24,00:08:10.63

395

I'm taking my ex-girlfriend[br]off my speed dialer.

396



397

00:08:11.20,00:08:13.16

398

No, it's a good thing.

399



400

00:08:13.40,00:08:16.68

401

Why must we dial so speedily anyway?[br]Why rush through life?

402



403

00:08:16.92,00:08:18.84

404

Why can't we savor[br]the precious moments?

405



406

00:08:19.08,00:08:20.52

407

You have some huge breasts!

408



409

00:08:22.96,00:08:24.64

410

-Hi.[br]-Hi.

411



412

00:08:25.28,00:08:29.24

413

So I heard about this Mark guy[br]that Rachel met today.

414



415

00:08:29.48,00:08:30.47

416

Isn't it great?

417



418

00:08:32.24,00:08:35.04

419

Yeah, pretty good.[br]He sounds like a nice, good guy.

420



421

00:08:35.24,00:08:38.16

422

Oh, he is.[br]And he is so dreamy!

423



424

00:08:38.40,00:08:41.04

425

I mean, when he left,[br]I actually used the phrase:

426



427

00:08:41.28,00:08:43.12

428

"Hummina, hummina, hummina. "

429



430

00:08:45.12,00:08:46.44

431

That's excellent.

432



433

00:08:50.28,00:08:52.64

434

So he's "just a nice guy. "

435



436

00:08:53.24,00:08:56.79

437

Do you really think this Mark[br]doesn't want anything for helping you?

438



439

00:08:57.04,00:08:59.96

440

Well, I assume I'll[br]have to take showers with him.

441



442

00:09:00.20,00:09:01.68

443

But that's true of any job.

444



445

00:09:06.72,00:09:07.63

446

How you feeling?

447



448

00:09:07.88,00:09:09.88

449

Well, my apartment isn't[br]there anymore. . .

450



451

00:09:10.12,00:09:11.84

452

. . .because I drank it.

453



454

00:09:14.32,00:09:17.76

455

Where'd you go? We lost you[br]after you opened up all the presents.

456



457

00:09:18.28,00:09:22.04

458

I ended up in the storage room,[br]and not alone.

459



460

00:09:24.52,00:09:26.83

461

No "woo-hooing. " No "woo-hooing. "

462



463

00:09:28.28,00:09:29.16

464

Why, what happened?

465



466

00:09:32.20,00:09:34.04

467

I fooled around with Joey's sister.

468



469

00:09:35.44,00:09:36.96

470

That's not the worst part.

471



472

00:09:37.32,00:09:38.68

473

What is the worst part?

474



475

00:09:38.88,00:09:40.84

476

I can't remember which sister.

477



478

00:09:42.08,00:09:44.47

479

You see what men do?[br]Don't tell me men are nice.

480



481

00:09:44.80,00:09:46.36

482

This is men!

483



484

00:09:50.08,00:09:51.15

485

Are you insane?

486



487

00:09:51.40,00:09:54.20

488

Joey will kill you.[br]He'll actually kill you dead.

489



490

00:09:54.40,00:09:56.40

491

You don't think I thought of that?

492



493

00:09:57.32,00:10:00.08

494

-How can you not know which one?[br]-That's unbelievable.

495



496

00:10:00.32,00:10:02.12

497

-Was it Gina?[br]-Which one's Gina?

498



499

00:10:02.36,00:10:04.56

500

The dark, big hair,[br]with airplane earrings.

501



502

00:10:04.80,00:10:05.84

503

That's Dina, not Gina.

504



505

00:10:06.52,00:10:09.44

506

See? You can't tell[br]which is which either!

507



508

00:10:11.40,00:10:13.84

509

We didn't fool around[br]with any of them.

510



511

00:10:17.44,00:10:20.44

512

It's got to be veronica.[br]The girl in the red skirt.

513



514

00:10:20.68,00:10:23.44

515

I definitely stuck my tongue[br]down her throat!

516



517

00:10:24.04,00:10:24.84

518

That was me.

519



520

00:10:28.52,00:10:31.36

521

When I drink, sometimes[br]I get overly friendly. . .

522



523

00:10:31.60,00:10:33.24

524

-. . .and I'm sorry.[br]-That's okay.

525



526

00:10:33.44,00:10:35.24

527

-That's all right.[br]-That's okay.

528



529

00:10:39.40,00:10:41.24

530

Can I talk to you for a second?

531



532

00:10:42.72,00:10:44.04

533

Hey, Joey!

534



535

00:10:46.52,00:10:47.43

536

Come on.

537



538

00:10:48.52,00:10:50.04

539

Why can't we talk in here. . .

540



541

00:10:50.24,00:10:51.64

542

. . .with witnesses?

543



544

00:10:52.72,00:10:54.64

545

I just got off the phone[br]with my sister.

546



547

00:10:54.84,00:10:55.64

548

Which one?

549



550

00:10:55.88,00:10:58.11

551

-Mary Angela.[br]-Mary Angela.

552



553

00:10:58.52,00:11:00.40

554

Now which one is she again?

555



556

00:11:00.60,00:11:02.96

557

Ask Chandler.[br]He fooled around with her.

558



559

00:11:03.52,00:11:06.48

560

She told me you said[br]you could really fall for her.

561



562

00:11:06.72,00:11:10.60

563

Is that true, or are you just getting[br]over Janice by groping my sister?

564



565

00:11:13.52,00:11:15.24

566

It's gotta be the first one.

567



568

00:11:16.44,00:11:17.27

569

Really?

570



571

00:11:17.80,00:11:19.32

572

That's great!

573



574

00:11:20.32,00:11:22.84

575

You and my sister, sitting in a tree!

576



577

00:11:24.40,00:11:25.84

578

Yep, I'm in a tree.

579



580

00:11:29.16,00:11:30.76

581

Did he call? Did Mark call?

582



583

00:11:31.00,00:11:33.20

584

I'm sorry.[br]But the weekend's not over yet.

585



586

00:11:36.60,00:11:39.16

587

Oh, my God! ls that Phoebe?

588



589

00:11:39.40,00:11:41.60

590

Guess they're back from their date.

591



592

00:11:43.32,00:11:45.04

593

Music!

594



595

00:11:45.68,00:11:47.64

596

very nice!

597



598

00:11:55.28,00:11:56.32

599

Oh, my God!

600



601

00:11:59.32,00:12:00.60

602

So how are you?

603



604

00:12:01.40,00:12:04.76

605

-I am good. I finished my book.[br]-What's it about?

606



607

00:12:04.96,00:12:07.64

608

I don't remember.[br]Do you want to take a walk?

609



610

00:12:11.28,00:12:12.40

611

"Dear Mary Angela:

612



613

00:12:13.04,00:12:14.56

614

Hi, how's it going?

615



616

00:12:14.76,00:12:17.07

617

This is the hardest letter[br]I've ever had to write. "

618



619

00:12:17.32,00:12:19.36

620

What the hell's the matter with you?

621



622

00:12:19.88,00:12:23.24

623

How will Joey react to you[br]blowing off his sister with a letter?

624



625

00:12:23.44,00:12:26.08

626

That's where you tell him[br]that I moved to France. . .

627



628

00:12:27.12,00:12:28.96

629

. . .when actually I'll be in Cuba.

630



631

00:12:29.68,00:12:32.92

632

Look, you've got to do this[br]yourself in person.

633



634

00:12:33.12,00:12:34.16

635

You know her name.

636



637

00:12:34.40,00:12:36.96

638

You just go to the house[br]and ask for Mary Angela.

639



640

00:12:37.20,00:12:39.43

641

When whichever one she is[br]comes to the door. . .

642



643

00:12:39.64,00:12:42.03

644

. . .take her for a walk[br]and let her down easy.

645



646

00:12:42.68,00:12:45.36

647

What if she comes to the door[br]and I ask for her?

648



649

00:12:46.84,00:12:47.64

650

Where in Cuba?

651



652

00:13:00.96,00:13:02.72

653

What are you doing here?

654



655

00:13:02.92,00:13:04.88

656

Waiting for my grandma[br]to do my laundry.

657



658

00:13:05.12,00:13:06.16

659

What about you?

660



661

00:13:07.00,00:13:09.12

662

I'm here to see Mary Angela.

663



664

00:13:09.88,00:13:12.11

665

You are so the man! Come on.

666



667

00:13:13.68,00:13:15.56

668

Now look, listen.[br]Listen. . . .

669



670

00:13:16.24,00:13:18.84

671

Be cool, because Grandma[br]doesn't know about you two.

672



673

00:13:19.08,00:13:20.64

674

You don't want to tick her off.

675



676

00:13:21.12,00:13:25.04

677

She was, like, the sixth person[br]to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

678



679

00:13:26.60,00:13:27.75

680

Where's Mary Angela?

681



682

00:13:28.92,00:13:30.64

683

She's right in there.

684



685

00:13:32.84,00:13:34.64

686

-Hey, Chandler![br]-Hey, Chandler!

687



688

00:13:38.72,00:13:40.56

689

I can't believe Mark didn't call.

690



691

00:13:40.80,00:13:42.48

692

It's Sunday night and he didn't call.

693



694

00:13:42.88,00:13:43.87

695

Bummer.

696



697

00:13:45.08,00:13:48.12

698

Yeah, right. Look at you.[br]You're practically giddy.

699



700

00:13:48.32,00:13:50.68

701

I'm genuinely sorry[br]the Mark thing didn't work out.

702



703

00:13:50.92,00:13:54.96

704

Look, Rach, I want[br]only good things for you.

705



706

00:13:55.20,00:13:57.35

707

Wait a minute.[br]Why don't you just call Mark?

708



709

00:13:59.92,00:14:02.07

710

Who says you have to sit[br]and wait for him?

711



712

00:14:02.28,00:14:03.92

713

You've got to make stuff happen!

714



715

00:14:04.12,00:14:06.92

716

Yeah, but you don't[br]wanna seem too pushy.

717



718

00:14:07.72,00:14:10.24

719

It's not pushy.[br]He gave her his home number.

720



721

00:14:10.60,00:14:13.56

722

He gave you his home number,[br]as in, to his home?

723



724

00:14:13.80,00:14:17.48

725

And you don't mind if I call,[br]because you want good things for me.

726



727

00:14:17.72,00:14:21.24

728

That's right, good things.[br]That is what I said.

729



730

00:14:24.44,00:14:27.44

731

Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Greene.

732



733

00:14:30.72,00:14:33.64

734

Oh, no.[br]Don't you apologize.

735



736

00:14:34.32,00:14:35.28

737

Yeah, I'll hold.

738



739

00:14:35.80,00:14:37.28

740

He left my number at work.

741



742

00:14:37.52,00:14:40.56

743

Then he had to help his niece[br]with her report on the pioneers.

744



745

00:14:41.44,00:14:43.64

746

That is so made up!

747



748

00:14:44.88,00:14:46.44

749

Oh, my God! Tomorrow?

750



751

00:14:46.68,00:14:48.28

752

That's--[br]No, it's perfect.

753



754

00:14:48.52,00:14:50.64

755

Oh, God![br]Thank you so much!

756



757

00:14:50.84,00:14:52.28

758

Great.

759



760

00:14:52.68,00:14:53.80

761

I got the interview!

762



763

00:14:54.84,00:14:55.64

764

There you go!

765



766

00:14:55.84,00:14:58.76

767

He even offered to meet me for lunch[br]and prep me for it.

768



769

00:14:59.00,00:14:59.96

770

That is amazing!

771



772

00:15:00.72,00:15:03.84

773

Well, if I know Mark,[br]and I think I do. . .

774



775

00:15:04.84,00:15:06.24

776

. . .I'd expect nothing less.

777



778

00:15:06.48,00:15:07.92

779

I gotta figure out what to wear.

780



781

00:15:08.12,00:15:11.24

782

High collar and baggy pants say,[br]"I'm a pro! "

783



784

00:15:12.08,00:15:13.07

785

Yeah, right.

786



787

00:15:13.32,00:15:15.24

788

Okay, I'll see you guys later.

789



790

00:15:15.68,00:15:17.24

791

You go get them!

792



793

00:15:17.92,00:15:20.84

794

What did I do to you?[br]Did I hurt you in some way?

795



796

00:15:21.48,00:15:22.28

797

What?

798



799

00:15:22.48,00:15:24.63

800

"Why don't you call him?"

801



802

00:15:25.04,00:15:28.35

803

Thank you very much.[br]Now he's gonna prep her. . .

804



805

00:15:28.56,00:15:32.40

806

. . .as in what you do before[br]you surgically remove the boyfriend!

807



808

00:15:32.84,00:15:33.75

809

Are you crazy?

810



811

00:15:33.96,00:15:37.24

812

Am l? Am I out of my mind?[br]Am I losing my senses?

813



814

00:15:39.00,00:15:42.28

815

This dreamy guy's taking my girlfriend[br]out for a meal!

816



817

00:15:42.52,00:15:44.20

818

This isn't even about you!

819



820

00:15:44.40,00:15:46.92

821

It's about something wonderful[br]happening for Rachel.

822



823

00:15:47.36,00:15:50.04

824

Even if you're right,[br]and he wants to sleep with her. . .

825



826

00:15:50.24,00:15:51.84

827

. . .does that mean he gets to?

828



829

00:15:52.24,00:15:54.08

830

-No, but--[br]-Don't you trust her?

831



832

00:15:55.60,00:15:58.04

833

Then get over yourself![br]Grow up!

834



835

00:16:02.08,00:16:03.64

836

You grow up.

837



838

00:16:14.80,00:16:17.32

839

This tiramisu is excellent.

840



841

00:16:18.12,00:16:19.76

842

Did you make it, Mary Angela?

843



844

00:16:19.96,00:16:21.24

845

No, I did.

846



847

00:16:22.44,00:16:24.04

848

Well, it's yummy.

849



850

00:16:25.12,00:16:25.92

851

So. . . .

852



853

00:16:26.28,00:16:28.64

854

Mary Angela, do you like it?

855



856

00:16:28.88,00:16:31.03

857

Of course.[br]It's her favorite.

858



859

00:16:33.20,00:16:34.43

860

So. . . .

861



862

00:16:35.12,00:16:37.76

863

Mary Angela, what's[br]your second favorite?

865

00:16:37.96,00:16:39.44

866

More of Grandma's tiramisu.

867



868

00:16:39.68,00:16:41.83

869

Oh, would you just please. . .

870



871

00:16:43.72,00:16:47.43

872

. . .give me your recipe, because[br]this is great! It's topnotch!

873



874

00:16:47.72,00:16:48.79

875

That dies with me.

876



877

00:16:49.00,00:16:50.23

878

So will l.

879



880

00:16:52.32,00:16:54.47

881

Excuse yourself[br]and go to the bathroom.

882



883

00:16:54.72,00:16:57.00

884

I was just squinting.[br]It doesn't mean anything.

885



886

00:16:57.20,00:16:58.43

887

Just do it!

888



889

00:17:04.04,00:17:06.04

890

Will you excuse me, I have to. . . .

891



892

00:17:19.04,00:17:21.04

893

Finally! I thought we'd[br]never be alone.

894



895

00:17:21.28,00:17:22.84

896

Can I just tell you something?

897



898

00:17:23.08,00:17:25.92

899

I have not stopped thinking about you[br]since the party.

900



901

00:17:27.48,00:17:31.08

902

Look, I may have jumped the gun here.

903



904

00:17:33.00,00:17:34.68

905

I just got out of a relationship.

906



907

00:17:34.92,00:17:36.72

908

And I'm not really in a. . .

909



910

00:17:37.08,00:17:38.68

911

. . .in a commitment kind of place.

912



913

00:17:38.88,00:17:39.84

914

So? Me neither!

915



916

00:17:40.08,00:17:43.28

917

God, Mary Angela was right.[br]You do have the softest lips.

918



919

00:17:45.08,00:17:46.52

920

You're not Mary Angela?

921



922

00:17:46.88,00:17:48.68

923

No! I'm Mary Therese!

924



925

00:17:49.28,00:17:50.84

926

This is so bad.

927



928

00:17:51.28,00:17:53.96

929

If you're not Mary Angela,[br]then who is?

930



931

00:17:54.16,00:17:55.23

932

I am.

933



934

00:17:56.80,00:17:58.44

935

Oh, it's so bad.

936



937

00:18:00.24,00:18:02.31

938

No, Joey! No, Joey!

939



940

00:18:03.32,00:18:04.44

941

What's going on?

942



943

00:18:05.84,00:18:07.88

944

You're it![br]Now run and hide!

945



946

00:18:09.12,00:18:11.64

947

It's no big deal.[br]Chandler was just kissing me. . .

948



949

00:18:11.84,00:18:13.68

950

. . .because he thought[br]I was Mary Angela.

951



952

00:18:13.92,00:18:16.76

953

What? How could you[br]think she was Mary Angela?

954



955

00:18:16.96,00:18:19.88

956

I wasn't sure which one[br]Mary Angela was.

957



958

00:18:21.28,00:18:23.28

959

Look, I'm sorry.[br]I was really drunk. . .

960



961

00:18:23.52,00:18:25.75

962

. . .and you guys[br]all look really similar.

963



964

00:18:25.96,00:18:28.60

965

-I say punch him, Joey![br]-Yeah, punch him!

966



967

00:18:28.84,00:18:30.07

968

We should all calm down. . .

969



970

00:18:30.32,00:18:32.63

971

. . .because your brother's[br]not gonna punch me.

972



973

00:18:33.52,00:18:34.64

974

Are you?

975



976

00:18:35.52,00:18:37.08

977

That's usually what I'd do.

978



979

00:18:37.32,00:18:39.63

980

But I never thought you'd be[br]on the receiving end.

981



982

00:18:39.88,00:18:41.40

983

How could you do this?

984



985

00:18:41.60,00:18:43.83

986

If you wanna punch me, go ahead.[br]I deserve it.

987



988

00:18:44.08,00:18:48.24

989

But I want you to know that I'd never[br]soberly hurt you or your family.

990



991

00:18:48.44,00:18:50.16

992

You're my best friend.

993



994

00:18:50.40,00:18:53.04

995

And I'd never do anything[br]like this, ever again.

996



997

00:18:54.92,00:18:55.88

998

So what?

999



1000

00:18:56.12,00:18:58.88

1001

-I say punch him![br]-Yeah, punch him!

1002



1003

00:18:59.96,00:19:02.56

1004

No, I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

1005



1006

00:19:03.12,00:19:04.92

1007

-I'll do it.[br]-No, you won't!

1008



1009

00:19:05.44,00:19:09.04

1010

He knows he did a terrible thing,[br]and I believe him. He's sorry.

1011



1012

00:19:09.28,00:19:11.24

1013

But you got one more apology to make.

1014



1015

00:19:11.44,00:19:13.48

1016

You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

1017



1018

00:19:14.24,00:19:15.84

1019

-Absolutely. You got it.[br]-All right.

1020



1021

00:19:25.76,00:19:27.60

1022

-Cookie, now you can punch him![br]-What?

1023



1024

00:19:36.24,00:19:37.64

1025

What are you doing here?

1026



1027

00:19:37.88,00:19:40.76

1028

You know, this building's[br]on my paper route, so. . . .

1029



1030

00:19:42.72,00:19:43.95

1031

How did it go?

1032



1033

00:19:44.20,00:19:46.67

1034

The woman I interviewed with[br]was pretty tough. . .

1035



1036

00:19:46.92,00:19:48.72

1037

. . .but thank God Mark coached me.

1038



1039

00:19:48.92,00:19:51.56

1040

Once I talked about the Fall line,[br]she got all happy.

1041



1042

00:19:51.76,00:19:54.04

1043

-I'm so proud of you.[br]-Me too!

1044



1045

00:19:55.24,00:19:56.47

1046

Listen, I'm. . . .

1047



1048

00:19:57.60,00:20:00.84

1049

I'm sorry I've been[br]so crazy and jealous and. . . .

1050



1051

00:20:01.92,00:20:04.07

1052

It's just,[br]I like you a lot, so. . . .

1053



1054

00:20:04.32,00:20:05.23

1055

I know.

1056



1057

00:20:07.72,00:20:08.52

1058

-Hi.[br]-Hi, Mark.

1059



1060

00:20:09.04,00:20:12.32

1061

I just talked to Joanna,[br]and she loves you. You got the job.

1062



1063

00:20:13.12,00:20:14.27

1064

I did?

1065



1066

00:20:15.12,00:20:16.32

1067

Oh, my God!

1068



1069

00:20:16.56,00:20:18.92

1070

Congratulations. . . .

1071



1072

00:20:23.84,00:20:25.07

1073

So, Phoebe?

1074



1075

00:20:25.48,00:20:26.39

1076

How was your date?

1077



1078

00:20:26.60,00:20:28.12

1079

Oh, well, you know. . . .

1080



1081

00:20:28.72,00:20:30.64

1082

Yeah, I do know.

1083



1084

00:20:31.28,00:20:32.51

1085

You were eavesdropping?

1086



1087

00:20:32.72,00:20:36.51

1088

Eavesdropping? Pheebs, the ceiling[br]tiles were falling down.

1089



1090

00:20:38.16,00:20:39.64

1091

Oh, I'm sorry.

1092



1093

00:20:39.84,00:20:44.76

1094

But I really like this guy[br]and I think he really likes me.

1095



1096

00:20:49.92,00:20:50.96

1097

Maybe he's just. . .

1098



1099

00:20:51.20,00:20:54.28

1100

. . .jumping on a pogo stick[br]and he really likes it.

1101



1102

00:20:57.84,00:20:59.80

1103

Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

1104



1105

00:21:01.60,00:21:04.24

1106

All right, that's it.[br]He cannot do this to Phoebe!

1107



1108

00:21:04.44,00:21:07.48

1109

This guy's gonna get[br]the butt-kicking of a lifetime!

1110



1111

00:21:07.72,00:21:09.84

1112

But is he a big guy?

1113



1114

00:21:10.12,00:21:11.27

1115

We'll all go. Come on.

1116



1117

00:21:11.48,00:21:13.04

1118

Thanks, you guys.[br]Thank you!

1119



1120

00:21:13.24,00:21:14.04

1121

Don't worry!

1122



1123

00:21:14.64,00:21:17.60

1124

God![br]I hope they kick his ass!

1125



1126

00:21:17.80,00:21:19.16

1127

Honey, I'm sorry.

1128



1129

00:21:19.36,00:21:20.92

1130

If it's any consolation. . .

1131



1132

00:21:21.12,00:21:23.84

1133

. . .he sounded like[br]he had more fun with you.

1134
