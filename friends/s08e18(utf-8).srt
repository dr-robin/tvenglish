1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
Is it okay if I bring someoneto your parents' anniversary?

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
- Sure.- Yeah.

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
- Who's the guy?- Parker, we met at the cleaners.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
Did he put a little starchin your bloomers?

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Who said that?

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
No, he's really great, though.He has this incredible zest for life.

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
He treats me like a queen. Exceptwhen he treats me like a naughty girl.

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
Would it be okay if I give the toast?

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
Even after what happenedat their 20th?

10
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
- I'd really like to.- Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

11
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast,and it always makes them cry.

12
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
- This year, I'm gonna make them cry.- You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
Any time Ross makes a toast, everyonecries and pats him on the back.

14
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
And they all come up to me and say,"God, your brother."

15
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
You know what they're gonna saythis year? "God, you."

16
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
Well, at least oneperson will be crying.

17
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
I'm an actor, and any actorworth his salt can cry on cue.

18
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
- Really? You can do that?- Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

19
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
Well, I can't do itwith you guys watching me!

00:01:17 --> 00:01:19

23
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
- What are you doing?- I'm working on my toast.

24
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
Or as I like to call it:"Sob-fest 2002."

25
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
- Hey, check this out.- It's a dog.

26
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
It's a dead dog.

27
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
Chi-Chi. She diedwhen I was in high school.

28
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
- You're talking about a dead pet?- It's good stuff, huh?

29
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
Joey? You got a presentfor my parents?

30
00:02:11 --> 00:02:15
In honor of their 35th anniversary,I had a star named after them.

31
00:02:15 --> 00:02:20
- That is so cool.- And I got "Kama Sutra for the Elderly."

32
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
- Do you guys have any extra ribbon?- Sure.

33
00:02:23 --> 00:02:28
What do you need? We got lace,satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt...

34
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
And I think my testiclesmay be in here too.

35
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog.

36
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
Monica couldn't get bracesbecause Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

37
00:02:43 --> 00:02:47
- What?- You're the 200-pounder that rode her!

38
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
Hey! Everybody, this is Parker.Parker, this is...

39
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
No, don't tell me. Let me guess:Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel...

40
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
...and I'm sorry,Phoebe didn't mention you.

41
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
Chandler, I'm kidding!Already you're my favorite.

42
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
- Tell me a little about yourselves.- Actually, we should get going.

43
00:03:09 --> 00:03:10
Classic Ross!

44
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
Rachel, look how you glow! May I?

45
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
I think you already are.

46
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
Rachel, you have lifegrowing inside you.

47
00:03:20 --> 00:03:25
Is there anything more miraculous...A picture of a dog! Whose is this?

48
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
That's my old dog.He passed away years ago.

49
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
Well, at least you were lucky to havehim. Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

50
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
- So where's the party?- It's in Massapequa.

51
00:03:38 --> 00:03:43
Massapequa, it sounds magical. Is itsteeped in Native American history?

52
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
Well, there is an Arby'sin the shape of a tepee.

53
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
I got my notes. You got the presents?

54
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
- I've got the car keys.- We're driving? Aces.

55
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
- So he seems like a nice guy.- Yeah, I like him a lot.

56
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
- You want to hang back and take a cab?- Okay, otherwise I'm not going.

57
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
- Hey, Mom.- This is such a great party!

58
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
Thirty-five years. Impressive.Do you have any pearls of wisdom?

59
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
- Jack?- Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

60
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
It's a good question, Dad.It's a good question.

61
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
- Congratulations, you two.- Thank you, we're so excited.

62
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
And also, congratulationson your wedding.

63
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
- Can we talk to you for just a moment?- Yeah.

64
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
It's just a little thing.

65
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
While we think it's marvelous you'rehaving this baby out of wedlock...

66
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
...our friends are less open-minded.

67
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
- We told them you're married.- What?

68
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
Thanks for going along with this.

69
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
- We have to pretend that we're married?- I had to shave my ears.

70
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
You can do this.

71
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
- Can you believe that?- I know.

72
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
If you do the ears, you may as welltake a pass at the nose.

73
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
I don't want to have to lieabout being married.

74
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
I don't either. But it's their party,and it's one night.

75
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
We don't have to lie.We won't talk.

76
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
If it comes up,we'll smile, we'll nod along...

77
00:05:12 --> 00:05:13
- Ross?- Rachel?

78
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.

79
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
Congratulations on the babyand on the wedding.

80
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
- Here's something to start you out.- How's marriage treating you?

81
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
- Unbelievable. It's great!- I love marriage.

82
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
We'll see you later.

83
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
- Hey!- Hi!

84
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
What a beautiful place.What a great night.

85
00:05:34 --> 00:05:39
I have to tell you, being herewith all of you in Event Room C...

86
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
...I feel so lucky. Think of the goodtimes that happened here.

87
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
The birthdays, the proms,the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!

88
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
None will compare with tonight.I don't want to forget it.

89
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
It's like I want to take a mentalpicture of you all. Click.

90
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
I don't think the flash went off.

91
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
- I'm gonna find the men's room.- Me too.

92
00:06:03 --> 00:06:09
There is someone with a tranquilizergun and a net looking for that man.

93
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
I have to go too, but I don'twant him complimenting my thing.

94
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
Glad we weren't in the car.Did he let up?

95
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
He called the Long IslandExpressway a "concrete miracle."

96
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
This room. This night.

97
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
That waiter! His shoes!I must take a mental picture!

98
00:06:27 --> 00:06:28
Sorry.

99
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

100
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
That depends, how much did you hear?

101
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
He's a little enthusiastic.What's wrong with that?

102
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
- It's so much.- Well, so what? I like him.

103
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
Do I make fun of the people you date?Tag, Janice, Mona.

104
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
No, because friends don't do that.Do you want my opinion?

105
00:06:50 --> 00:06:56
Your collective dating record readslike a who's who of human crap!

106
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
- I feel terrible.- I know.

107
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
What was wrong with Mona?

108
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
- Open it, open it, open it.- Yeah, baby!

109
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
So we never got to hearabout your wedding.

110
00:07:12 --> 00:07:17
- We were surprised we weren't invited.- No, it was a small wedding.

111
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
But it was beautiful.It was small, but kind of spectacular.

112
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
- Where did you have it?- On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

113
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
And Stevie Wonder sang "Isn't SheLovely" as I walked down the aisle.

114
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
- Stevie's a family friend.- Oh, my God. That's amazing.

115
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
- I'd love to see pictures.- Yeah, so would I.

116
00:07:36 --> 00:07:41
You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitzwould forget to put film in the camera.

117
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
Would you excuse us for a second?

118
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
- What are you doing?- What? This may be my only wedding.

119
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
- And I want it to be amazing.- Okay.

120
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
- Maybe I rode in on a Harley.- Ross, it has to be realistic.

121
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
Say, are you okay?You seem kind of quiet.

122
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
- No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.- And I'm with you. What a great time!

123
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
Look at this plate bouncy thing.

124
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
What an inspired solution to man'splate-dispensing problems.

125
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
Oysters! Let me feed you.That's not necessary.

126
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
- Please?- I don't eat...

127
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
- I won't quit until you try one.- Okay, fine.

128
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
- Good.- What're they like? I've never had one.

129
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
- Try one.- They look too weird.

130
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
- What are you doing?- Going over my toast.

131
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
I can't wait. They'll cry so hard,they'll be fighting for breath.

132
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
If you want to, I could justhold them down and you could just...

133
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
And my veil was lace,made by blind Belgian nuns.

134
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
- Blind?- Not at first, but it's intricate work.

135
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
They said even though they losttheir sight, it was worth it.

136
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
- I bet you looked beautiful.- Well, I don't know.

137
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
But there were some people that saidI looked like a floating angel.

138
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
- How did you propose?- Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

139
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
Well, actually, I took herto the planetarium.

140
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
That's where we had our first date.

141
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
I had the room filled with lilies,her favorite flower.

142
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
- That is so sweet!- I want to hear the rest!

143
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
Then Fred Astaire singing,"The Way You Look Tonight" came on...

144
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
...the lights came down,I got on one knee...

145
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
...and written across the dome,in the stars, were the words:

146
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
"Will you marry me?"

147
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
And the ring was the size of my fist.

148
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
Hey, Phoebe? Look...

149
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
...I want to apologize. Okay?We were being jerks.

150
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
- Parker's nice, I'd like to know him.- You better do it now.

151
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
- Why?- Because I'm gonna kill him.

152
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
- What?- He's too excited about everything.

153
00:10:01 --> 00:10:05
I'm all for living, but this isthe Gellers' 35th anniversary.

154
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
Let's call a spade a spade.This party stinks.

155
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
I'm having the worst time.

156
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
There was a line for the buffet,and when I got to the plates...

157
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
...I slipped on a giant booger.

158
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

159
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
It could've been.I didn't look at it.

160
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
I wiped it on Chandler's coatand got the hell out.

161
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
I thought he was a great guy.I was so excited about him.

162
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
Well, hey, you shouldbe excited about him.

163
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
There's nothing wrong with him.

164
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
- You think?- Yeah, know what?

165
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
- We were all just being too negative.- You're right.

166
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
He's just embracing life. We couldall stand to be more like Parker.

167
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
You know what? I'm like him!I'm a positive person!

168
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
- Actually, you have an edge.- What's that?

169
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
- Oh, it's Parker!- Look, the Bunny Hop!

170
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
- Oh, I love it!- You do?

171
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
Are you kidding? People actinglike animals to music? Come on!

172
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
Okay, it's time for the toast.

173
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
I know normally Ross gives the toast,but this year I'll do it.

174
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
No, it's gonna be great. Really.

175
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
Okay.

176
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
Mom, Dad, when I got married...

177
00:11:15 --> 00:11:20
...the thing that made me sure I coulddo it was the example you two set.

178
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
For that, and other things,I want to thank you.

179
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
I know I probably don'tsay it enough...

180
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
...but I love you.

181
00:11:38 --> 00:11:43
When I look around, I'm saddened by thethought of those who could not be here.

182
00:11:43 --> 00:11:48
Nana, my beloved grandmother,who would so want to be here.

183
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
But she can't...

184
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
...because she's dead.

185
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

186
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
I mean, look how cute she is... was.

187
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
Do me a favor,pass this to my parents.

188
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
Remember she's dead, okay?Her and Nana, gone.

189
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
Wow!

190
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
Does anybody remember when...

191
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
...Debra Winger had to say goodbye toher children in "Terms of Endearment"?

192
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
Didn't see that?

193
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
No movie fans?!

194
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
You want to hear something sad?

195
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
I was watching a "60 Minutes"piece on orphans in Romania...

196
00:12:35 --> 00:12:39
...who have been so neglectedthat they were incapable of love.

197
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
You people are made of stone!

198
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!

199
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
Thank you, Monica.That was interesting.

200
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
- Wasn't it interesting, Jack?- Why don't I remember this dog?

201
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
Ross? Why don't you give usyour toast now?

202
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
Oh, no, Mom.It's just Monica this year.

203
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
You're not saying anything?On our 35th wedding anniversary?

204
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
No, of course.

205
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
Everybody? I just wanted to say...

206
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel...

207
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
...and myself, that if...

208
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
...if in 35 years, we're halfas happy as you guys are...

209
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
...we'll count ourselvesthe luckiest people in the world.

210
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
Oh, Ross.

211
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
I just wish Nana were aliveto hear Ross' toast.

212
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
My God, what a fantasticallywell-lit hallway.

213
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
Can I get you something to drink,like a water and Valium?

214
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
I must say, this apartment,it's... there are no words.

215
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
- Thank God.- It's a haven.

216
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
- A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden.- Yeah, I know, I know. Gotcha.

217
00:14:10 --> 00:14:15
Listen, why don't we just sit andrelax, just be with each other quietly.

218
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
That sounds great.

219
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
This is the most comfortable couchI've ever sat on.

220
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
Let's try something.Let's play a game.

221
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
- I love games.- Shocking.

222
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
Let's play the game of...

223
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
...who can stay quiet the longest.

224
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
Or Jenga.

225
00:14:35 --> 00:14:41
Let's play this one first, andremember, whoever talks first loses.

226
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
- I lose, now Jenga.- Oh, my God.

227
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
- Is something wrong?- You know the word "wrong"?

228
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
Everything isn't perfect or magical?

229
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
Everything isn't aglowwith the light of fairies?

230
00:14:56 --> 00:15:01
- They were just brake lights, Parker!- Excuse me for seeing good in traffic.

231
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
You don't have to puta good spin on everything!

232
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
- I'm sorry. I'm a positive person.- No, I'm a positive person.

233
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

234
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
At Disneyland, getting laid!

235
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
You want me to be negative?You want me to be less happy?

236
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
Much less happy.

237
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,"I better be going."

238
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
So long!

239
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
Don't let the "best door in the world"hit you in the ass on your way out.

240
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
Isn't this the most incredible fightyou've had in your life?

241
00:15:41 --> 00:15:46
We could've gone from the ceremony tothe reception with you in the sidecar.

242
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47
It just isn't feasible.

243
00:15:47 --> 00:15:52
But a dove placing the ring on yourfinger would've been no problem.

244
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
- It was fun being married to you.- Yeah, and it was an easy 400 bucks.

245
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
- Okay, Ross, can I ask you something?- Yeah.

246
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
- That proposal at the planetarium?- I know, I know. It was stupid.

247
00:16:05 --> 00:16:10
Are you kidding? With the lilies,and the song and the stars?

248
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
It was really wonderful.Did you just make that up?

249
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
I thought of itwhen we were going out.

250
00:16:17 --> 00:16:21
That's how I imaginedI would ask you to marry me.

251
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
Wow.

252
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
Well, that would've beenvery hard to say no to.

253
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
It's a good thing I didn't do it, itsounds like a very expensive wedding.

254
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
- Okay, good night.- Good night.

255
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
Even if the sidecar had a windscreento protect your hair?

256
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
- I will think about it.- That's all I'm asking.

257
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
Okay, that's it. I give up.

258
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,you give the speech.

259
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
You know, I don't understandwhy they didn't cry.

260
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
- Come on.- That stuff you said about true love?

261
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
You were right. We did learna lot from Mom and Dad.

262
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
That picture of Chi-Chiwith her mischievous grin.

263
00:17:12 --> 00:17:17
And what you said about Nana? Yeah,she really would've wanted to be there.

264
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
And you know what?

265
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
I think she was.

266
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
Oh, good God, Ross,how the hell do you do it?

267
00:17:30 --> 00:17:30
