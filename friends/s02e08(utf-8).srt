I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
Ross kissed me.

4
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!Oh, my God!

5
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
It was unbelievable!

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!Oh, my God!

7
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
Let's hear everything.

8
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
Monica, get the wineand unplug the phone.

9
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
Rachel, does this end wellor do we need to get tissues?

10
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
It ended very well.

11
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
Do not start without me!Do not start without me!

12
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
Okay. All right.Let's hear about the kiss.

13
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
Was it a soft brushagainst your lips...

14
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
...or was it a "I gotta have you now"kind of thing?

15
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
Well, at first it was really intense,you know? And then...

16
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
Oh, God. And then we justsort of sunk into it.

17
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
So was he holding you?Or were his hands on your back?

18
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
No, actually, firstthey started out on my waist...

19
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
...and then they slid upand were in my hair.

20
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
And...

21
00:00:49 --> 00:00:50
...then I kissed her.

22
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
Tongue?

23
00:00:51 --> 00:00:54
- Yeah.- Cool.

Twelve megabytes of RAM,500-megabyte hard drive...

28
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
...built-in spreadsheet capabilities...

29
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
...and a modem that transmitsat over 28,000 BPS.

30
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
What will you use it for?

31
00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
Games and stuff.

32
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
There are no jobs.There are no jobs for me.

33
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
Oh, wait, here's one.

34
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
- Would you be willing to cook naked?- There's an ad for a naked chef?

35
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
No, but if you'll cook naked, thenyou might be willing to dance naked.

36
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
And then...

37
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
So how'd you make out last night?

38
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
That is funny.That is painfully funny.

39
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
No, wait, wait.

40
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
Yeah, that's just painful.

41
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
Wait a minute.I thought last night was great.

42
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Yeah, it was.But I get home...

43
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
...and I see Julie's saline solutionon my night table...

44
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
...and I think,"My God! What am I doing?"

45
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Here I am with Julie,this incredible, great woman...

46
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
...who I care aboutand who cares about me...

47
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
...and I'm justthrowing all that away?

48
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
You got all thatfrom saline solution?

49
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Wait. We're talking about Rachel.You and Rachel.

50
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
I've been dreaming aboutme and Rachel for 10 years.

51
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
But now I'm with Julie.

52
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
So it's like, me and Julie,me and Rachel.

53
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
Me and Julie, me and Rach...

54
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
Rachel! Rachel.

55
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
- Hey, you.- How are you?

56
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
Good. How are you?

57
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
Good.

58
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
- Hi, honey.- Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

59
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
Julie!

60
00:02:54 --> 00:02:54
How are you?

61
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
Good.

62
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
So everybody's here.

63
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
Everybody's good.

64
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
Were you gonna play something?

65
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
- Well, actually...- Play it!

66
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
All right.

67
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
- Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.- What?

68
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
Okay. Hi.

69
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
Hello. Hi. Okay.

70
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
This is a song about a love triangle...

71
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
...between three people I made up.

72
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
It's called"Two of Them Kissed Last Night".

73
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
We'll call her Betty

74
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
Let's call him Neil

75
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
This point too strongly

76
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
This story isn't real

77
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
Who will be the girl that he casts aside

78
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
Who he loves truly

79
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
Who we'll call Loolie

80
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
He must decide

81
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
He must decide

82
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
Well, this is a nice résumé.

83
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
Nice, nice, nice.

84
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
Muy impressivo.

85
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
Mr. Rastatter, what does thisjob entail? The ad wasn't clear.

86
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
Macholate.

87
00:04:15 --> 00:04:16
- I'm sorry?- Macholate.

88
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

89
00:04:21 --> 00:04:22
Go ahead, try a piece.

90
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
We think Macholate iseven better than chocolate.

91
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
All right.

92
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
I love how it crumbles.

93
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
- You see, chocolate doesn't do that.- No, ma'am.

94
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
We should be gettingour FDA approval any day now.

95
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

96
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
The way we see it,chocolate dominates...

97
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
...your major food-preparation holidays.Easter, Christmas, what have you.

98
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
But given the right marketing...

99
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
...we can make Thanksgivingthe Macholate holiday.

100
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
Wow.

101
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
Aren't you gonna swallow that?

102
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.

103
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
Isn't that great?

104
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
Well, anyhow...

105
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
...we're looking for chefswho can create Thanksgiving recipes.

106
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
You interested?

107
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
Abso...

108
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
...- lutely!

109
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
I love creating recipes,I love Thanksgiving, and now...

110
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
...I love Macholate.

111
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
Really?

112
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
Especially that aftertaste.I tell you...

113
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
...that'll last you till Christmas.

114
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
How about Macholate mousse?

115
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
It's not...

116
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
...very Thanksgiving-y.

117
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
How about Pilgrim Macholate mousse?

118
00:05:34 --> 00:05:35
What makes it Pilgrim?

119
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
We'll put buckles on it.

120
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
Did Ross call?

121
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
No, I'm sorry.

122
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
Why didn't he call?

123
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
He's gonna stay with Julie.

124
00:05:46 --> 00:05:47
He's gonna stay with herand she'll be:

125
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me."

126
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54
"We'll get married and have lotsof kids and dig up stuff together!"

127
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
No offense, but thatsounds nothing like her.

128
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
What am I gonna do?This is like a complete nightmare!

129
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
I know. This must be so hard."Oh, no! Two women love me!"

130
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
"They're both gorgeous,my wallet's too small for my 50s...

131
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

132
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
- Here's a thought...- Don't ever touch the computer.

133
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
Ross, listen.I got two words for you:

134
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
Threesome.

135
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
Let's get logical about this.We'll make a list.

136
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."

137
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
We'll put their namesin different fonts...

138
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
...and I can use differentcolors for each column.

139
00:06:35 --> 00:06:36
Can't we use a pen?

140
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
No, Amish boy.

141
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
Let's start with the consbecause they're more fun.

142
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Rachel first.

143
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
I don't know.

144
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
I mean...

145
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
All right, I guess you can sayshe's a little spoiled sometimes.

146
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
You could say that.

147
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
I guess, sometimesshe's a little ditzy, you know?

148
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
And I've seen her be a littletoo into her looks.

149
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
And Julie and I havea lot in common...

150
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
...because we're bothpaleontologists, right?

151
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
But Rachel's just a waitress.

152
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
Waitress.

153
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
Got it.You guys want to play Doom?

154
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
Or we could keep doing this.

155
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
What else?

156
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
I don't know.

157
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
Oh! Her ankles are a little chubby.

158
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
Okay, let's do Julie.

159
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
What's wrong with her?

160
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
She's not Rachel.

161
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
This is pumpkin piewith a Macholate crust.

162
00:07:34 --> 00:07:37
This is Macholate cranberry cake,and these are Macholate-chip cookies.

163
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
Just like the Indians served.

164
00:07:42 --> 00:07:43
Oh, my God!

165
00:07:43 --> 00:07:44
"Oh, my God" good?

166
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
Oh, my God! I can't believeyou let me put this in my mouth.

167
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
Sweet Lord!This is what evil must taste like!

168
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
I tell you, it won't print.

169
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
I pressed that button, like, 100 times.

170
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
For a hotline, you're not so hot.

171
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
What is that in the background?

172
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
Are you watching "Star Trek"?

173
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
So did you break Julie's heart?

174
00:08:15 --> 00:08:20
It was horrible. She cried, I cried.She threw things, they hit me.

175
00:08:21 --> 00:08:22
I did the right thing.

176
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
So Spock actually hugs his father?

177
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
Hey, do you guys have...

178
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
Where you going?

179
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
I just got back...

180
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
...from Julie's.

181
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
No, no.

182
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
It's not what you think.

183
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
It's the other thing.

184
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
Well, what's the other thing?What do I think?

185
00:08:52 --> 00:08:53
Well...

186
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
He broke up with Julie!

187
00:08:55 --> 00:08:59
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

188
00:08:59 --> 00:08:59
Really?

189
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
Really.

190
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
It's always been you, Rach.

191
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
Oh, God.

192
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
Oh, this is good.

193
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
- This is really good.- I know. I know.

194
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
It's almost...

195
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
What do you say we take a walk?Just us. Not them.

196
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
- Let me get my coat.- Okay. No, hey!

197
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
I'll get your coat.

198
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
He's going to get my coat.He's going to get my coat, Joey!

199
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
Joey, I can't believe this!This is unbelievable!

200
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
- What's that?- What? Nothing!

201
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
- I saw my name. What is it?- No, no, see? See?

202
00:09:49 --> 00:09:50
It's printing!

203
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
It's printing!

204
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
Let me see!

205
00:09:54 --> 00:09:55
Hey, someone order a coat?

206
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
Chandler wrote something about meand won't let me see.

207
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
He won't? He won't!

208
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
Because isn't that...

209
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
...the short story you were writing?

210
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
Yes, it is a short story...

211
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
...that I was writing.

212
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
And I'm in it?Let me read it.

213
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
No!

214
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
- Come on!- Hey, why don't you read it to her?

215
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
All right.

216
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
"It was summer."

217
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
"And it was hot."

218
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
"Rachel was there."

219
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
"A lonely gray couch."

220
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
"'Oh, look!' cried Ned."

221
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
"And the kingdom was his forever.The end!"

222
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
That's all you wrote?You're the worst writer in the world!

223
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
This isn't funny anymore.

224
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
There's something about meon that paper, and I want to see it.

225
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
No, you don't.

226
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
All right, fine. If you guys wantto be children, that's fine.

227
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
I do not need to see it!

228
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
What is this?

229
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
That is...

230
00:11:18 --> 00:11:18
What is this?

231
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
- Thank you.- Good luck.

232
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
Okay. Just remember how crazyI am about you, okay?

233
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
"Kind of ditzy"?

234
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
"Too into her looks"?

235
00:11:29 --> 00:11:30
"Spoiled"?

236
00:11:30 --> 00:11:34
A little spoiled. He was supposedto type "little", the idiot!

237
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
"Just a waitress"?

238
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Now that was...

239
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
I mean, as opposed to...

240
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

241
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
I do not have chubby ankles!

242
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
No! I...

243
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
Okay, look at the other side.Look at Julie's column.

244
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
"She's not Rachem"?

245
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
What the hell's a Rachem?

246
00:11:55 --> 00:11:56
Is that a stupid paleontology word...

247
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
...I wouldn't know,because I'm just a waitress?

248
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
Rach, come on!

249
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
It's "She's not Rachel"!

250
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
She's not...

251
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
My diary! Brilliant!

252
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
If I'd said it was my diary,she wouldn't have made me read it.

253
00:12:16 --> 00:12:21
That's true. You'd be a great personto have around after an emergency.

254
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
I cannot believe Rosseven made this list.

255
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
- I know.- What a dinkus!

256
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
Hey, cut him some slack.It was Chandler's idea.

257
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
What?

258
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
Oh, good. I was hopingthat would come up.

259
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
This was your idea?

260
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
Let's get some perspective here.These things happen for a reason.

261
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
Yeah. You!

262
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
Pheebs, back me up. You believein that karma crap, don't you?

263
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
By the way, good luckin your next life as a dung beetle.

264
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Rach!

265
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
Hey! Open up! Please?

266
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
When somebody does not buzz you in,Ross, that means, "Go away".

267
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
It doesn't mean,"Climb up the fire escape."

268
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
I just want to read youyour "Pro List".

269
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
Not interested.

270
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
"Number one:The way you cry at game shows."

271
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
"Number two:How much you love your friends."

272
00:13:23 --> 00:13:26
"Number three: The way you playwith your hair when you're nervous."

273
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
"Number four: How brave you arefor starting your life over."

274
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
"Number five:How great you are with Ben."

275
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
"Number six: The way you smell."

276
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
What are you doing?

277
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
You want to open the window?

278
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
Oh, yeah.

279
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
- What are you doing out there?- I'm...

280
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
You must be freezing.You know what you need?

281
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
How about a nice, steamingcup of hot Macholate?

282
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
Come on, open up.

283
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
Rach, come on.You gotta give me another chance.

284
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
No.

285
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
- No?- That's what I said.

286
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
Maybe we should go.

287
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
You don't have to go.We're done.

288
00:14:02 --> 00:14:03
I know how you must...

289
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
No! You don't, Ross.

290
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
Imagine the worst thingsyou think about yourself.

291
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
How would you feel if the personyou trusted most in the world...

292
00:14:12 --> 00:14:13
...not only thinks them too...

293
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
...but actually uses themas reasons not to be with you.

294
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
No, but see, I want to be with youin spite of all those things.

295
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
Well, that's mighty big of you.

296
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
I said, don't go!

297
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
You know what?

298
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
If it were the other way around, thereis nothing you could put on a list...

299
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
...that would make menot want to be with you.

300
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
Well, then I guess that'sthe difference between us.

301
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
See, I'd never make a list.

302
00:14:52 --> 00:14:57
I never know how long to waitin this situation before you can talk.

303
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
Maybe a little longer.

304
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
In these recipes,the quantities may seem unusual.

305
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
Like these coconut Macholateholiday nut bars?

306
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
I've indicated four cups of coconutand four cups of nuts...

307
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
...and only one tablespoonof Macholate.

308
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
Doesn't matter.

309
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

310
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
Something about laboratory rats.

311
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
Gosh, I'm sorry.

312
00:15:23 --> 00:15:24
Yeah.

313
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
Anyhow, here's your check.

314
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
Thank you for all the troubleyou went through.

315
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
Listen, you didn't eat a lot of itwhile you were cooking, did you?

316
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33
Well, I ate some.

317
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
Oh, some is fine.Some is not a lot.

318
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
So it doesn't burnwhen you pee, does it?

319
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
Is that him again?

320
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
Tell him I'd come to the phone,but my ankles are weighing me down.

321
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
I don't think this is the best time.

322
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
Look, can you do something for me?

323
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
Sure. What?

324
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
All right.

325
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
Music?

326
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
Sure.

327
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
to Rachel from Ross.

328
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
he's sorry for what he did...

329
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
... and he hopes you can forgive him.

330
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
See the stones set in your eyes

331
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
See the thorn twist in your side

332
00:16:35 --> 00:16:39
I'll wait for you

333
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
Sleight of hand and twist of fate

334
00:16:45 --> 00:16:49
On a bed of nails she makes me wait

335
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
And I'll wait without you

336
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
and she told us what Ross did.

337
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
And, Ross, if you're listening...

338
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
your song anymore.

339
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
to a couple that stands a chance?

340
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
she hit you with her car...

341
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
will work it out.

342
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
There's a room where

343
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
I can go

344
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
And tell my secrets to

345
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
In my room

346
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
In my room

347
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
Thanks for coming in again.

348
00:17:42 --> 00:17:45
Not at all. I have no morals,and I need the cash.

349
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

350
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

351
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
They taste exactlylike pistachios...

352
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
...but they're madeof reconstituted fish bits.

353
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
Here, try one.

354
00:17:58 --> 00:18:00
- All right.- You're not allergic to anything?

355
00:18:00 --> 00:18:01
Cat hair.

356
00:18:01 --> 00:18:03
Oh, sorry.
