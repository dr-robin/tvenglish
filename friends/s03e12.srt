16

00:00:05.31,00:00:07.50

17

-Does everybody hate these shoes?[br]-Yeah.

18



19

00:00:07.95,00:00:11.70

20

But nobody will focus on that[br]if you wear that towel-dress.

21



22

00:00:13.63,00:00:14.46

23

Tell him.

24



25

00:00:14.67,00:00:18.74

26

It's her first day at this new job.[br]You shouldn't start with her.

27



28

00:00:19.63,00:00:22.09

29

All right.[br]I suppose I can wait a day.

30



31

00:00:23.23,00:00:24.90

32

-What are you doing Friday?[br]-Why?

33



34

00:00:25.15,00:00:27.71

35

Come to my weird cousin Albert's[br]bachelor party.

36



37

00:00:27.95,00:00:29.66

38

You know, he's the botanist?

39



40

00:00:29.91,00:00:31.13

41

Oh, God!

42



43

00:00:31.75,00:00:33.18

44

Botanists are such geeks.

45



46

00:00:34.99,00:00:36.13

47

Is that a dinosaur tie?

48



49

00:00:41.95,00:00:42.98

50

Morning!

51



52

00:00:43.23,00:00:45.53

53

Rach, I'm here with the purses!

54



55

00:00:47.15,00:00:49.66

56

It must take you forever[br]to find your keys.

57



58

00:00:50.19,00:00:51.46

59

Thank you, Pheebs.

60



61

00:00:51.71,00:00:54.70

62

You're welcome. Please want the one[br]with the turtles.

63



64

00:00:54.95,00:00:57.18

65

No, turtles scare me.[br]I don't need that today.

66



67

00:00:58.47,00:01:00.98

68

Honey, just relax.[br]It's gonna be fine.

69



70

00:01:01.23,00:01:03.66

71

Why don't I come[br]and take you to lunch?

72



73

00:01:03.91,00:01:06.37

74

Thank you![br]But Mark's taking me out.

75



76

00:01:07.35,00:01:11.02

77

Mark? ls that the same Mark[br]that helped you get the job?

78



79

00:01:11.23,00:01:13.79

80

It's like a "good luck on your[br]first day" thing.

81



82

00:01:14.03,00:01:15.17

83

Is this a lunch box?

84



85

00:01:16.15,00:01:18.50

86

No, a purse.[br]And there's a thermos in it.

87



88

00:01:21.07,00:01:23.34

89

-So can you make it on Friday?[br]-What?

90



91

00:01:23.55,00:01:26.01

92

I think so.[br]Why am I invited to this again?

93



94

00:01:26.23,00:01:27.78

95

Apparently, Albert has no friends.

96



97

00:01:27.99,00:01:29.86

98

He's excited about the bachelor party.

99



100

00:01:30.07,00:01:33.26

101

He's only getting married[br]so he can see a stripper.

102



103

00:01:34.95,00:01:38.26

104

A stripper at a bachelor party.[br]That is so cliché.

105



106

00:01:38.51,00:01:40.94

107

Why don't you guys get a magician?

108



109

00:01:41.75,00:01:45.34

110

If he can open my beer[br]with his butt-cheeks, then all right.

111

00:01:47.03,00:01:49.06

118

00:02:32.15,00:02:34.98

119

She's having lunch with him?[br]Lunch with him?

120



121

00:02:35.19,00:02:37.86

122

You should've seen him hug her[br]when she got the job!

123



124

00:02:38.11,00:02:40.86

125

And he's really good-looking.

126



127

00:02:42.07,00:02:44.37

128

-What am I gonna do?[br]-You don't do anything.

129



130

00:02:44.63,00:02:47.06

131

Keep it inside.[br]Learn how to hide your feelings.

132



133

00:02:48.67,00:02:49.86

134

Don't cry out loud.

135



136

00:02:53.67,00:02:55.90

137

Guess who has an audition[br]for a Broadway musical?

138



139

00:02:56.11,00:02:59.46

140

I wanna say you, but it seems like[br]such an easy answer.

141



142

00:03:00.07,00:03:00.86

143

It is me!

144



145

00:03:01.07,00:03:03.74

146

It's a musical version[br]of A Tale of Two Cities.

147



148

00:03:03.95,00:03:07.30

149

So I think I'm gonna sing[br]"New York, New York" . . .

150



151

00:03:07.55,00:03:10.06

152

. . .and "I Left My Heart[br]in San Francisco. "

153



154

00:03:12.71,00:03:16.22

155

Joey, I don't think[br]you get to pick the cities.

156



157

00:03:16.99,00:03:17.78

158

What?

159



160

00:03:17.99,00:03:19.94

161

Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.

162



163

00:03:21.31,00:03:22.10

164

Who?

165



166

00:03:24.07,00:03:25.86

167

I'll get you the Cliff Notes.

168



169

00:03:26.19,00:03:26.98

170

The what?

171



172

00:03:28.43,00:03:29.38

173

The abridgment.

174



175

00:03:33.11,00:03:34.25

176

The what?

177



178

00:03:38.75,00:03:40.26

179

Then the style number. . .

180



181

00:03:40.83,00:03:43.86

182

. . .the invoice number[br]and the shipping date.

183



184

00:03:44.87,00:03:46.86

185

Good. Any questions so far?

186



187

00:03:47.35,00:03:48.94

188

What kind of discount do we get?

189



190

00:03:49.79,00:03:50.58

191

Twenty percent.

192



193

00:03:51.35,00:03:53.26

194

I love this job!

195



196

00:03:55.11,00:03:57.26

197

-My first call![br]-Here, let me.

198



199

00:03:58.19,00:03:59.90

200

Rachel Greene's line.[br]May I help you?

201



202

00:04:00.11,00:04:01.25

203

Hi, is Rachel there?

204



205

00:04:01.55,00:04:04.38

206

-And who may I say is calling?[br]-This is Ross.

207



208

00:04:04.63,00:04:05.50

209

Ross of. . .?

210



211

00:04:06.35,00:04:08.70

212

Of "Ross and Rachel. "

213



214

00:04:09.43,00:04:11.02

215

Hi, it's Mark.

216



217

00:04:11.35,00:04:13.10

218

-Hey, Mark.[br]-Hey.

219



220

00:04:13.35,00:04:15.94

221

Hold on a second.[br]It's Ross.

222



223

00:04:17.07,00:04:18.26

224

Hi, honey.

225



226

00:04:18.67,00:04:20.97

227

What's Mark doing[br]answering your phone?

228



229

00:04:21.23,00:04:22.90

230

Oh, he's just goofing around.

231



232

00:04:23.15,00:04:25.45

233

Oh, that's funny.

234



235

00:04:27.07,00:04:29.90

236

Why isn't he goofing around[br]in his own office?

237



238

00:04:30.11,00:04:34.02

239

This is his office too. I told you,[br]we're Joanna's two assistants.

240



241

00:04:34.63,00:04:36.38

242

Why does Joanna need two assistants?

243



244

00:04:36.63,00:04:38.54

245

How lazy is she?

246



247

00:04:39.67,00:04:41.74

248

Oh, my God! What did I just do?

249



250

00:04:41.95,00:04:44.06

251

I just shipped 3000 bras to Personnel!

252



253

00:04:44.27,00:04:45.90

254

I gotta go![br]Mark, I need you!

255



256

00:04:46.11,00:04:47.86

257

Okay! Bye-bye!

258



259

00:04:51.35,00:04:53.86

260

I'm sorry, sweetie.[br]I was just trying to--

261



262

00:04:54.07,00:04:55.90

263

I was dialing another number.

264



265

00:05:08.87,00:05:12.30

266

I got changed in 30 seconds[br]so you could be alone with him.

267



268

00:05:12.55,00:05:13.77

269

You better go for it.

270



271

00:05:13.99,00:05:15.94

272

I'm not going for anything.

273



274

00:05:16.15,00:05:17.54

275

Well, if you don't, I will.

276



277

00:05:17.75,00:05:19.38

278

Would you please go?

279



280

00:05:19.95,00:05:21.26

281

'Night, Mon.

282



283

00:05:23.07,00:05:25.02

284

'Night, Julio.

285



286

00:05:35.35,00:05:37.02

287

Someone left their book here.

288



289

00:05:37.95,00:05:39.70

290

Actually, that is mine.

291



292

00:05:41.23,00:05:42.50

293

What are you reading?

294



295

00:05:42.75,00:05:46.45

296

Flowers of Evil, by Baudelaire.[br]Have you read it?

297



298

00:05:47.15,00:05:48.66

299

Have I read it?

300



301

00:05:50.11,00:05:52.06

302

No. Are you enjoying it?

303



304

00:05:53.47,00:05:56.14

305

I thought I would,[br]but the translation's no good.

306



307

00:05:57.43,00:05:59.14

308

You're a poet[br]and you don't know it.

309



310

00:06:02.87,00:06:04.50

311

Actually, l. . . .

312



313

00:06:04.87,00:06:05.98

314

I am a poet.

315



316

00:06:08.47,00:06:09.86

317

So you do know it.

318



319

00:06:14.63,00:06:18.06

320

So what kind of things[br]do you write about?

321



322

00:06:18.91,00:06:20.66

323

Things that move me:

324



325

00:06:21.11,00:06:22.98

326

The shadow of a tree. . .

327



328

00:06:24.03,00:06:25.17

329

. . .a child laughing. . .

330



331

00:06:27.15,00:06:28.18

332

. . .or this lip.

333



334

00:06:28.83,00:06:29.86

335

Mine?

336



337

00:06:30.75,00:06:31.86

338

Right here?

339



340

00:06:33.59,00:06:37.66

341

I could write an epic poem[br]about this lip.

342



343

00:06:43.15,00:06:44.66

344

How would that go?

345



346

00:06:55.15,00:06:57.66

347

Well, it didn't rhyme. . .

348



349

00:06:57.91,00:06:58.89

350

. . .but I liked it.

351



352

00:07:01.75,00:07:05.66

353

You've got to pick a pocket or two...

354



355

00:07:05.91,00:07:07.18

356

...boys

357



358

00:07:07.55,00:07:10.46

359

You've got to pick a pocket...

360



361

00:07:10.67,00:07:13.58

362

...or two

363



364

00:07:17.43,00:07:18.34

365

Lovely.

366



367

00:07:18.87,00:07:20.06

368

Just lovely.

369



370

00:07:20.43,00:07:21.74

371

Really? Thanks.

372



373

00:07:21.95,00:07:25.30

374

We definitely want to see you[br]for the callback on Saturday.

375



376

00:07:25.67,00:07:26.70

377

Excellent!

378



379

00:07:27.47,00:07:28.50

380

I'll be there.

381



382

00:07:28.75,00:07:32.02

383

Don't forget to bring your jazz shoes[br]for the dance audition.

384



385

00:07:35.95,00:07:39.22

386

My agent said that[br]it wasn't a dancing part.

387



388

00:07:39.43,00:07:42.10

389

All the roles gotta dance a little.

390



391

00:07:42.35,00:07:45.34

392

But with your dance background,[br]it'll be a piece of cake.

393



394

00:07:45.55,00:07:48.66

395

"Three years of modern dance[br]with Twyla Tharp"?

396



397

00:07:49.75,00:07:52.46

398

"Five years with[br]the American Ballet Theatre"?

399



400

00:07:54.55,00:07:57.70

401

Everybody lies on their résumé, okay?

402



403

00:07:57.95,00:08:00.25

404

I wasn't one of[br]the Zoom kids either.

405



406

00:08:01.23,00:08:03.38

407

Well, can you, like, dance at all?

408



409

00:08:03.59,00:08:05.66

410

Yeah, I can dance.[br]You know. . . .

411



412

00:08:17.99,00:08:19.10

413

What is that?

414



415

00:08:19.55,00:08:23.06

416

Sure, it looks stupid now.[br]There's no music playing.

417



418

00:08:23.75,00:08:25.86

419

I have to get that.[br]But, no, no.

420



421

00:08:29.19,00:08:30.06

422

Hi.

423



424

00:08:31.67,00:08:36.26

425

Listen, I'm in need of a stripper[br]and I was told that you do that.

426



427

00:08:39.75,00:08:42.86

428

Let me ask you this. What do you do[br]for the extra hundred?

429



430

00:08:44.35,00:08:47.46

431

So would I have to provide the grapes?

432



433

00:08:48.43,00:08:49.22

434

Hi.

435



436

00:08:49.87,00:08:51.90

437

How was last night[br]with Julio, se~norita?

438



439

00:08:52.15,00:08:56.58

440

It was amazing. He's sexy and smart,[br]which makes him even sexier.

441



442

00:08:56.83,00:08:59.26

443

Last night we were fooling around. . .

444



445

00:08:59.47,00:09:02.34

446

. . .and all of a sudden he stops[br]to write a poem.

447



448

00:09:02.67,00:09:05.94

449

Get out! I couldn't stop[br]if a meteor hit me.

450



451

00:09:08.15,00:09:12.46

452

We have our stripper,[br]a "Miss Crystal Chandelier. "

453



454

00:09:12.91,00:09:16.18

455

Name a kid that, what do you[br]expect them to grow up to be?

456



457

00:09:18.51,00:09:21.10

458

But he forgot[br]to take the poem with him.

459



460

00:09:21.35,00:09:25.66

461

I am totally dense about poetry,[br]but I think this is pretty good.

462



463

00:09:25.91,00:09:27.05

464

Check it out.

465



466

00:09:29.19,00:09:32.06

467

"The Empty vase.[br]Translucent beauty--"

468



469

00:09:32.31,00:09:33.50

470

To yourself.

471



472

00:09:37.55,00:09:38.77

473

You know, that's pretty good.

474



475

00:09:39.55,00:09:41.74

476

Yeah, I think so too.[br]Phoebe?

477



478

00:09:41.95,00:09:43.58

479

Great![br]I'm so glad you guys like it!

480



481

00:09:43.83,00:09:46.06

482

-I gotta go to work.[br]-I'm not done.

483



484

00:09:47.15,00:09:49.02

485

Give it back when[br]you're through.

486



487

00:09:49.35,00:09:50.66

488

-See you guys.[br]-Bye-bye.

489



490

00:09:52.19,00:09:54.38

491

Oh, my God! Oh, my God![br]Poor Monica!

492



493

00:09:54.59,00:09:55.73

494

What? What? What?

495



496

00:09:56.99,00:09:59.14

497

He was with her[br]when he wrote this poem!

498



499

00:09:59.35,00:10:02.18

500

"My vessel so lovely,[br]with nothing inside"?

501



502

00:10:02.43,00:10:05.10

503

"Now that I've touched you,[br]you seem emptier still"?

504



505

00:10:05.35,00:10:08.10

506

He thinks Monica's empty.[br]She's the empty vase!

507



508

00:10:08.63,00:10:10.38

509

You really think he meant that?

510



511

00:10:10.59,00:10:11.50

512

Totally.

513



514

00:10:11.75,00:10:14.34

515

Oh, God![br]And she seems so happy too.

516



517

00:10:14.95,00:10:15.86

518

Done.

519



520

00:10:26.31,00:10:28.58

521

Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?

522



523

00:10:28.79,00:10:31.38

524

Oh, yeah, sure! It's right--

525



526

00:10:35.83,00:10:36.94

527

What's that?

528



529

00:10:37.67,00:10:39.82

530

It's from Ross. It's a Love Bug.

531



532

00:10:41.91,00:10:44.86

533

Somebody wants people to know[br]you have a boyfriend.

534



535

00:10:45.79,00:10:47.46

536

That's not what he's doing.

537



538

00:10:47.67,00:10:49.06

539

He's just really romantic.

540



541

00:10:50.35,00:10:53.06

542

Excuse me. Are you Rachel Greene?

543



544

00:10:55.35,00:10:56.26

545

One, two, three.

546



547

00:10:56.47,00:10:59.30

548

Congratulations on your first week[br]At your brand-newjob

549



550

00:10:59.95,00:11:01.90

551

It won 't be long[br]Before you're the boss

552



553

00:11:02.95,00:11:05.86

554

And you know who will be there[br]To support you

555



556

00:11:06.11,00:11:07.38

557

Your one and only boyfriend

558



559

00:11:07.63,00:11:09.06

560

It's nice to have a boyfriend!

561



562

00:11:09.31,00:11:12.98

563

Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross!

564



565

00:11:19.31,00:11:21.90

566

I'm hurt![br]I'm actually hurt. . .

567



568

00:11:22.15,00:11:25.85

569

. . .that you'd think I'd send those[br]things out of anything but love.

570



571

00:11:26.11,00:11:27.06

572

Hurt!

573



574

00:11:28.47,00:11:30.93

575

All right, I get it. You're hurt!

576



577

00:11:31.15,00:11:33.26

578

Can't a guy send[br]a barbershop quartet. . .

579



580

00:11:33.51,00:11:35.74

581

. . .to his girlfriend's office anymore?

582



583

00:11:37.71,00:11:40.27

584

Oh, please![br]It was so obvious. . .

585



586

00:11:40.47,00:11:42.77

587

. . .Iike you were marking[br]your territory.

588



589

00:11:42.99,00:11:46.66

590

You might as well have just come in[br]and peed around my desk!

591



592

00:11:48.47,00:11:50.10

593

I would never do that.

594



595

00:11:52.71,00:11:54.70

596

Look, I know what's going on here.

597



598

00:11:54.95,00:11:59.02

599

Mark explained it all to me.[br]He said this is what you guys do.

600



601

00:11:59.23,00:12:02.85

602

Well, if Mark said that,[br]then Mark's an idiot.

603



604

00:12:03.11,00:12:04.30

605

Mark's a genius.

606



607

00:12:04.51,00:12:06.50

608

Why? How?[br]How is he a genius?

609



610

00:12:06.75,00:12:08.26

611

Don't you see what's happening?

612



613

00:12:08.51,00:12:11.46

614

Instead of hitting on her now,[br]he's becoming her confidante.

615



616

00:12:11.71,00:12:14.86

617

Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to,[br]to complain about you.

618



619

00:12:15.11,00:12:16.09

620

What am I gonna do?

621



622

00:12:16.39,00:12:18.10

623

Why don't you send her a musical bug?

624



625

00:12:18.35,00:12:19.62

626

No, you already did that.

627



628

00:12:22.75,00:12:25.31

629

You're gonna have to go[br]there yourself now.

630



631

00:12:25.55,00:12:27.02

632

Make a few surprise visits.

633



634

00:12:27.23,00:12:28.10

635

I don't know, guys.

636



637

00:12:28.35,00:12:30.50

638

Fine, don't do anything.[br]Sit and talk to us.

639



640

00:12:30.75,00:12:33.21

641

Meanwhile, she is talking[br]to him about you.

642



643

00:12:33.43,00:12:34.90

644

And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.

645



646

00:12:35.15,00:12:39.06

647

She's thinking, "Maybe he's the guy[br]for me because he understands me. "

648



649

00:12:39.31,00:12:41.18

650

And before you know it,[br]she's with him.

651



652

00:12:41.43,00:12:43.46

653

And you'll be all, "Oh, man! "

654



655

00:12:44.63,00:12:46.30

656

And he'll be all, "Yes! "

657



658

00:12:47.95,00:12:50.94

659

And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude! "

660



661

00:12:52.87,00:12:55.25

662

And pretty soon you'll be like:

663



664

00:12:55.47,00:12:56.69

665

"Hi. "

666



667

00:12:58.15,00:13:02.54

668

And, "Well, I can't go.[br]Rachel and Mark might be there. "

669



670

00:13:03.47,00:13:06.10

671

And we'll be like, "Man, get over it![br]It's been four years! "

672



673

00:13:09.15,00:13:11.45

674

He paints quite a picture,[br]doesn't he?

675



676

00:13:14.67,00:13:16.78

677

Here's the Shelley Segal stuff[br]for December.

678



679

00:13:17.03,00:13:19.06

680

Wait, I've got something for you.

681



682

00:13:20.23,00:13:21.78

683

It's okay. Rachel knows.

684



685

00:13:22.03,00:13:23.86

686

Yeah, but even so--

687



688

00:13:24.27,00:13:27.26

689

I can't help it.[br]I'm just crazy about you.

690



691

00:13:27.51,00:13:30.34

692

Oh, that is so sweet!

693



694

00:13:32.15,00:13:35.10

695

I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today,[br]but it's just so tough.

696



697

00:13:35.35,00:13:38.38

698

I see you walking around,[br]and I want to touch and hold you. . . .

699



700

00:13:38.95,00:13:41.18

701

Come on, no one's around.[br]Just kiss me.

702



703

00:13:41.43,00:13:43.50

704

All right, that's it![br]Get off of her!

705



706

00:13:43.75,00:13:44.81

707

What is going on?

708



709

00:13:45.03,00:13:47.70

710

What's going on?[br]I'll tell you what's going on!

711



712

00:13:54.03,00:13:58.38

713

I have been down in your store[br]for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.

714



715

00:14:00.43,00:14:02.86

716

What do I have to do[br]to get some service?

717



718

00:14:04.95,00:14:05.86

719

Hi, Rach.

720



721

00:14:15.71,00:14:16.50

722

Joey Tribbiani?

723



724

00:14:21.75,00:14:23.06

725

I've got a problem.

726



727

00:14:23.31,00:14:25.30

728

I just got a call[br]from my dance captain.

729



730

00:14:25.55,00:14:28.46

731

He's having a relationship crisis[br]and can't leave Long lsland.

732



733

00:14:28.71,00:14:30.66

734

Does that mean the audition's off?

735



736

00:14:30.91,00:14:34.18

737

Seeing as you've got[br]the most experience. . .

738



739

00:14:34.39,00:14:37.18

740

. . .I want you to teach these dancers[br]the combination.

741



742

00:14:39.43,00:14:40.30

743

What?

744



745

00:14:40.95,00:14:44.57

746

Come on, it's easy.[br]You know, it's hand, hand. . .

747



748

00:14:44.83,00:14:46.46

749

. . .head, head. . .

750



751

00:14:46.67,00:14:48.26

752

. . .up, pas de bourrée,[br]pas de bourrée. . .

753



754

00:14:48.51,00:14:51.10

755

. . .big turn here, rond de jambe. . . .

756



757

00:14:51.35,00:14:53.42

758

Slide, step, step. . .

759



760

00:14:53.63,00:14:55.10

761

. . .and jazz hands!

762



763

00:14:58.03,00:15:01.02

764

So that's, "Steppity-step[br]and jazz hands. "

765



766

00:15:01.23,00:15:02.45

767

Have fun.

768



769

00:15:03.35,00:15:04.30

770

Bye.

771



772

00:15:09.55,00:15:10.90

773

What are you wrapping?

774



775

00:15:11.31,00:15:13.06

776

Look what I got Julio.

777



778

00:15:16.55,00:15:18.26

779

It's a vase.

780



781

00:15:19.19,00:15:20.66

782

Just like the one in the poem.

783



784

00:15:20.87,00:15:23.25

785

Not exactly like[br]the one in the poem.

786



787

00:15:24.35,00:15:25.30

788

What do you mean?

789



790

00:15:25.75,00:15:28.58

791

Remember how you said you were[br]really dense about poetry?

792



793

00:15:34.87,00:15:36.90

794

So I'm just an empty vase?

795



796

00:15:37.11,00:15:38.30

797

What?

798



799

00:15:38.79,00:15:41.09

800

So, I don't read as many[br]important books as you do.

801



802

00:15:41.35,00:15:45.58

803

And I don't write trick poems[br]that aren't about what they seem.

804



805

00:15:45.79,00:15:48.17

806

And I get excited about[br]stupid stuff. . .

807



808

00:15:48.39,00:15:50.90

809

. . .Iike when my[br]People magazine comes. . .

810



811

00:15:51.15,00:15:53.45

812

. . .and the new[br]"Hold Everything" catalog.

813



814

00:15:53.67,00:15:57.74

815

But that doesn't mean I'm empty. I[br]care about things. Friends and family.

816



817

00:15:57.95,00:16:01.65

818

You have no right to judge me![br]You don't even know me!

819



820

00:16:02.31,00:16:04.30

821

The poem is not about you.

822



823

00:16:05.51,00:16:06.30

824

What?

825



826

00:16:06.55,00:16:09.26

827

"The Empty vase" is not about you.

828



829

00:16:09.47,00:16:11.38

830

My baby preciosa....

831



832

00:16:11.63,00:16:13.74

833

You make me so sad[br]that you would think this.

834



835

00:16:16.63,00:16:17.66

836

I'm sorry. It's. . . .

837



838

00:16:18.23,00:16:19.45

839

My friend Phoebe said--

840



841

00:16:20.55,00:16:22.26

842

It's about all women.

843



844

00:16:24.07,00:16:24.90

845

Well. . .

846



847

00:16:25.23,00:16:27.22

848

. . .all American women.

849



850

00:16:29.15,00:16:30.34

851

You feel better now?

852



853

00:16:35.87,00:16:37.30

854

All right, let's do it.

855



856

00:16:57.15,00:16:58.29

857

What was that?

858



859

00:16:59.11,00:17:01.46

860

It's the best[br]I could get out of them.

861



862

00:17:03.11,00:17:04.50

863

Well, people!

864



865

00:17:04.75,00:17:06.74

866

People, people, people!

867



868

00:17:07.27,00:17:10.94

869

Let's try it again. And this time,[br]everybody watch Joey.

870



871

00:17:13.39,00:17:14.86

872

Show 'em how it's done.

874

00:17:20.63,00:17:21.85

875

Count it off, Mack.

876



877

00:17:33.83,00:17:36.46

878

Did you have fun at[br]the bachelor party last night?

879



880

00:17:36.71,00:17:39.50

881

Look what I got![br]See, she's dressed, right?

882



883

00:17:39.75,00:17:43.06

884

And then you click it,[br]and uh-oh, she's naked!

885



886

00:17:44.75,00:17:47.34

887

And then you click it again[br]and she's dressed.

888



889

00:17:47.55,00:17:49.78

890

She's a business woman[br]walking down the street.

891



892

00:17:49.99,00:17:52.45

893

She's window shopping,[br]and oh, she's naked!

894



895

00:18:04.03,00:18:06.74

896

I'm gonna spend some alone time[br]with the pen.

897



898

00:18:15.51,00:18:18.07

899

I'm sorry. I was an idiot.

900



901

00:18:18.55,00:18:19.90

902

A big idiot.

903



904

00:18:20.11,00:18:21.46

905

A big idiot.

906



907

00:18:22.67,00:18:24.97

908

It's just,[br]you have to realize. . .

909



910

00:18:25.23,00:18:26.98

911

. . .this Mark thing is hard for me.

912



913

00:18:27.47,00:18:30.70

914

Why is it hard? We've been together[br]for almost a year now.

915



916

00:18:31.75,00:18:34.78

917

Well, I was with Carol[br]for, like, eight years.

918



919

00:18:35.03,00:18:36.66

920

And I lost her.

921



922

00:18:37.75,00:18:40.62

923

And now, if it's possible,[br]I think I love you even more.

924



925

00:18:41.47,00:18:44.26

926

So it's hard for me[br]to believe I'm not gonna. . .

927



928

00:18:44.47,00:18:48.09

929

. . .well, that someone else isn't[br]gonna take you away.

930



931

00:18:48.31,00:18:50.87

932

Let it be me. Let it be me!

933



934

00:18:55.95,00:18:58.82

935

Honey, that's very sweet.

936



937

00:18:59.03,00:19:02.65

938

It just seems to me, though,[br]that if two people love each other. . .

939



940

00:19:02.91,00:19:05.26

941

. . .and trust each other,[br]like we do. . .

942



943

00:19:05.47,00:19:07.50

944

. . .there's no reason to be jealous.

945



946

00:19:15.11,00:19:16.09

947

I gotta get going.

948



949

00:19:16.67,00:19:17.46

950

Bye, Chandler.

951



952

00:19:18.75,00:19:22.53

953

This pen's getting kind of boring.[br]Can you pick me up some porn?

954



955

00:19:25.43,00:19:26.34

956

Where you going?

957



958

00:19:26.55,00:19:29.18

959

I've gotta go pick up Ben[br]for a play-date this afternoon.

960



961

00:19:29.87,00:19:30.93

962

With who?

963



964

00:19:31.15,00:19:33.61

965

Just this woman I met last night[br]at the party.

966



967

00:19:33.83,00:19:35.46

968

There was a woman at--?

969



970

00:19:37.75,00:19:38.81

971

The stripper?

972



973

00:19:41.55,00:19:43.82

974

You have a play-date with a stripper?

975



976

00:19:45.07,00:19:46.86

977

Man, I gotta get a kid!

978



979

00:19:54.75,00:19:57.31

980

We started talking[br]after she did her thing. . .

981



982

00:19:57.55,00:19:59.58

983

. . .and she's got a boy[br]about Ben's age.

984



985

00:19:59.83,00:20:02.86

986

So we're gonna take the kids[br]to a Gymboree class.

987



988

00:20:03.47,00:20:05.50

989

-Is that okay?[br]-Sure. Is she married?

990



991

00:20:12.71,00:20:13.58

992

Are you jealous?

993



994

00:20:15.79,00:20:18.46

995

I just don't see why she has[br]to play with you.

996



997

00:20:18.71,00:20:23.46

998

I mean, doesn't she have any other[br]stripper-mom friends of her own?

999



1000

00:20:26.87,00:20:28.98

1001

You are totally jealous!

1002



1003

00:20:29.43,00:20:30.65

1004

I'm not jealous.

1005



1006

00:20:30.87,00:20:32.50

1007

This is about. . .

1008



1009

00:20:34.31,00:20:37.30

1010

. . .people feeling certain things. . .

1011



1012

00:20:37.55,00:20:39.06

1013

. . .you know, about. . .

1014



1015

00:20:39.75,00:20:42.86

1016

. . .strippers. And, you know. . . .

1017



1018

00:20:43.11,00:20:44.22

1019

I love you too.

1020



1021

00:20:44.75,00:20:45.62

1022

Bye.

1023



1024

00:20:46.07,00:20:47.13

1025

Wait, wait, wait!

1026



1027

00:20:47.55,00:20:48.46

1028

What?

1029



1030

00:21:01.59,00:21:05.06

1031

Well, there's a kiss he won't forget[br]for a few hours.

1032



1033

00:21:06.07,00:21:09.46

1034

Either that or you just turned him on[br]and sent him to a stripper.

1035



1036

00:21:15.31,00:21:17.26

1037

Is there a Julio here?

1038



1039

00:21:18.23,00:21:19.18

1040

I am Julio.

1041



1042

00:21:21.07,00:21:22.50

1043

Mr. Pretentious

1044



1045

00:21:23.19,00:21:26.10

1046

You think there's no one finer[br]Your poems are unpublished

1047



1048

00:21:26.35,00:21:28.06

1049

And you work in a diner

1050



1051

00:21:28.27,00:21:32.50

1052

You're no God's gift to women[br]That's all in your head

1053



1054

00:21:33.07,00:21:34.50

1055

You are just a butt-munch

1056



1057

00:21:34.71,00:21:35.82

1058

No one likes a butt-munch!

1059



1060

00:21:36.03,00:21:39.22

1061

And you're also bad in bed

1062
