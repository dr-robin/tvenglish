4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09
You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

5
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
Don't cry.

6
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
Don't cry.

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
Why is he still crying?

8
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
Let me hold him for a sec.

9
00:00:18 --> 00:00:19
Here we go.

10
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
There we are.

11
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
Maybe it's me.

12
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.

13
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
You know, I once dateda Miss Cranky Pants.

14
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

15
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
There we go, all better.

16
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
There's my little boy.

17
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
Can I see something?

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:54
Cool!

19
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
He hates me.My nephew hates me!

20
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
Come on, don't do this.

21
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
What if my own baby hates me?What do I do then?

22
00:01:00 --> 00:01:01
Monica, stop! This is nuts.

23
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
Do you know how long it'll bebefore you have to deal with this?

24
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

25
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
Joey, she does not look fat.

Goo, goo, goo!

30
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
That is so funny!Let me see that a sec.

31
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
You okay?

32
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
I don't know.

33
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
What's in this pie?

34
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
I don't know. Butter and eggsand flour and lime and kiwi...

35
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

36
00:02:17 --> 00:02:18
You said it was a key lime pie.

37
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.That's what makes it so special.

38
00:02:22 --> 00:02:25
That's what's gonna kill me.

39
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
I'm allergic to kiwi.

40
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
No, you're not. You're allergicto lobster and peanuts and...

41
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
Oh, my God!

42
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
It's definitely getting worse.

43
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
Is your tongue swelling up?

44
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
Either that or my mouthis getting smaller!

45
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Get your coat.We're going to the hospital.

46
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
- Will he be okay?- He's gotta get a shot.

47
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
You know, actually,it's getting better. It is.

48
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Let's not go.Anyone up for Scrabble?

49
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
Jacket, now!

50
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
What about Ben? We can'tbring a baby to the hospital.

51
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
We'll watch him.

52
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
I don't think so.

53
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
I have seven Catholic sisters.I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

54
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
Come on, we want to do it.Don't we?

55
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
I was gonna play basketball...

56
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
...but I guess that's out the window.

57
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
If you take him out for a walk,remember to bring his hat.

58
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
There's milk in the refrigeratorand diapers in the bag.

59
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
Hat, milk...

60
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
Got it!

61
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
Consider it done!

62
00:03:24 --> 00:03:24
You understood?

63
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

64
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
Is he the onewith the beautiful wife?

65
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
You want to hear the songI'm singing this afternoon?

66
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
I wrote it this morning in the shower.

67
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
And I'm writing a song

68
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
Stop me if you've heard it

69
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet

70
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget

71
00:04:00 --> 00:04:05
Rachel, sweetheart,could I see you for a minute?

72
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
What's up?

73
00:04:08 --> 00:04:09
FYl:

74
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
I've decided to pay a professionalmusician to play here on Sundays.

75
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
Her name is Stephanie something.She's supposed to be very good.

76
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
But what about Phoebe?

77
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
It's not that your friend is bad.

78
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
It's that she's so bad...

79
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
...she makes me want to put my fingerthrough my eye into my brain...

80
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
...and swirl it around.

81
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Okay, so you're not a fan.

82
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
But, I mean, come on.You cannot do this to her.

83
00:04:40 --> 00:04:41
I have to do this to her?

84
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
Lather, rinse, repeat

85
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
And lather, rinse, repeat

86
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
And lather, rinse, repeat

87
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
As needed

88
00:04:55 --> 00:04:56
We didn't bring enough stuff.

89
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
Did you forget to packthe baby's anvil?

90
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.

91
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
It's a known factthat women love babies.

92
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
Women love guys who love babies.It's the sensitive thing.

93
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
Aim him at that pack of babes.Maybe one of them will break away.

94
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
Wait, forget them.We got one. Hard left.

95
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
- Give me the baby.- No, I got him.

96
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
Come on, seriously.

97
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
Oh, seriously, you want him?

98
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
Who is this little cutie-pie?

99
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
Well, don't think me immodest, but...

100
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
...me.

101
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
Want to smell him?

102
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
I assume we're talking about the baby?

103
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
He's got that great baby smell.Get a whiff of his head.

104
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
My uterus just skipped a beat.

105
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
What'd I tell you?

106
00:05:40 --> 00:05:41
It's great you're doing this.

107
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
Well, we are great guys.

108
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
My brother and his boyfriendhave been trying to adopt.

109
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
What agency did you two go through?

110
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
But this is my gig.

111
00:05:53 --> 00:05:54
This is where I play.

112
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
My name is written out there in chalk.

113
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

114
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
Honey, I'm sorry.

115
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
And he's going tobe paying this woman?

116
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
Why doesn't he just give hera throne and a crown?

117
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
And, like, a gold stickwith a ball on top?

118
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
Terry is a jerk! That's whywe always say, "Terry's a jerk!"

119
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
That's where that came from.

120
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
You probably did everything you could.

121
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
You know what? Let me justsee what else I could do.

122
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
Just let her go on afterStephanie whatever her name is.

123
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
You won't be here.You don't pay her.

124
00:06:32 --> 00:06:33
I don't know.

125
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

126
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
You don't cleanthe cappuccino machine?

127
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
Of course I clean it.

128
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
I mean, I will clean it.

129
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
I mean, I will clean it.

130
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
All right, fine, fine, fine!

131
00:06:51 --> 00:06:52
- Done.- Really?

132
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
Who's working for you, babe?

133
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!How much am I gonna get?

134
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
What?

135
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
He's paying the peoplewho were playing.

136
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
I meant, he's paying that other womanbecause she's a professional.

137
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
I'm not gonna be the only onewho's not getting paid.

138
00:07:10 --> 00:07:11
I'm sorry, no!

139
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
No, I'm not some sloppy second,you know, charity band.

140
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
There are thousands of placesin this city...

141
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
...where people would payto hear me play.

142
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
When I play, I play for me

143
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
I don't need your charity

144
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
Thank you!

145
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
I'm not getting a shot.Maybe they can take the needle...

146
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
...and squirt it into my mouth.Like a squirt gun.

147
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

148
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
I see someone's havinga little allergic reaction.

149
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
Doctor, can I see youfor just a moment?

150
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
My brother hasa slight phobia about needles.

151
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
Did you tell himabout my squirt gun idea?

152
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
My brother, the Ph.D.,would like to know...

153
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
...if there's any wayto treat this orally?

154
00:07:57 --> 00:08:01
Under these circumstances, it has to bean injection, and it has to be now.

155
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
So?

156
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
Go and have a seat. The doctorsays it's got to be a needle.

157
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
You're just going to have to be brave.Can you do that for me?

158
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

159
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
You want to squeeze my hand?

160
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

161
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
Honey, really.Don't squeeze it so hard!

162
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
Let go of my hand!

163
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
Good plan. Next timewe want to pick up women...

164
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
...we should go tothe park and make out.

165
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
Taxi! Taxi!

166
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
Look at that talent.

167
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
Just practicing. You're good.

168
00:08:42 --> 00:08:43
Carry on.

169
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
Wait, wait, wait!

170
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

171
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
Can you tell him that?Because he thinks he looks too pink.

172
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
- What are you guys out doing today?- We're not out.

173
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
We're two heterosexual guyshanging with the son...

174
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
...of our other heterosexual friend,doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

175
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
You done?

176
00:09:05 --> 00:09:06
There's our stop.

177
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
Get out of here!This is our stop.

178
00:09:09 --> 00:09:10
You guys live around here too?

179
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
We live in the buildingby the sidewalk.

180
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
You know it?

181
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
Since we're neighbors, what do you saywe get together for a drink?

182
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
So you want to go to Markel's?

183
00:09:27 --> 00:09:28
Sure, they love us over there.

184
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
Where's your baby?

185
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
Ben! Ben!

186
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
That's good. Maybe he'llhear you and pull the cord!

187
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
Stop the bus!

188
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
Are you sure he didn't break it?It hurts.

189
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

190
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
And right here isthe puncture wound from your ring.

191
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
- I'm really sorry.- It's okay.

192
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
Sorry.

193
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
Sorry! I got my S's back!

194
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
Which we can celebrate later.

195
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
Celebrate. Celebrate...

196
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
He was a double, double

197
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
Double-jointed boy

198
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
So are you theprofessional guitar player?

199
00:10:23 --> 00:10:24
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

200
00:10:24 --> 00:10:29
Right. My name was on there,but now it just says carrot cake.

201
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
So how many chords do you know?

202
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
- All of them.- So you know D?

203
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
Do you know A-minor?

204
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
Do you know how to gofrom D to A-minor?

205
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
So does your guitar have a strap?

206
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
Mine does.

207
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
Stephanie knows all the chords

208
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
Come on! Pick up, pick up!

209
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
Transit Authority?

210
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
I'm doing research for a book.

211
00:11:03 --> 00:11:08
I was wondering what somebody might doif they left a baby on a city bus.

212
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
Yes, I realize that would bea stupid character.

213
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
Here's the deal:We lost a car seat on a bus.

214
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
It's white plastic andit fits onto a stroller.

215
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
And there was a baby in it.

216
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
He wants to talk to you.

217
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
Everybody, let's give a warmCentral Perk welcome to...

218
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
And he won't let me work

219
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
And I hate Central Perk

220
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
To Stephanie Schiffer!

221
00:11:37 --> 00:11:42
I'd like to start with a song I wrotefor the first man I ever loved.

222
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
Zachary...

223
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
Are all invited to bite me

224
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
We're the guys that calledabout the baby! Is he here?!

225
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
He's here.

226
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
I assume one of you is the father.

227
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
- That's me.- I'm him.

228
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
Actually, we're both the father.

229
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.

230
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
Please tell me you knowwhich one is our baby.

231
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
That one has ducks on his T-shirtand this one has clowns.

232
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

233
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
Or clowns.

234
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
That one's Ben! Remember he hadthat cute little mole by his mouth!

235
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

236
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
Okay, the mole came off.

237
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
What are we gonna do?

238
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
We'll flip for it.Ducks or clowns.

239
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
- Flip for the baby?- You got a better idea?

240
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
All right, call it in the air.

241
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
Heads.

242
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Heads, it is.

243
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
We have to assign heads to something!

244
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
Right!

245
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
Ducks is headsbecause ducks have heads.

246
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
What kind of scary-ass clownscame to your birthday?

247
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
Of the morning, angel

248
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
Before you leave me, baby

249
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
Of the morning, angel

250
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
Then slowly turn away

251
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
I won't beg you to stay

252
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
With me

253
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
Here. I thought you might be cold.

254
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
Thank you.

255
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
Look at you!You did pretty well.

256
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
$8.27.

257
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
But not really, becauseI put in the first two.

258
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
Just to get the ball rollingand to make myself feel better.

259
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
Do you?

260
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
You know, this whole playingfor money thing is so not good for me.

261
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
I don't know, when Isang "Su-su-suicide"...

262
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
...I got, like, $ 1.75.

263
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
But then "Smelly Cat"?

264
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
I got 25 cents and a condom.

265
00:14:27 --> 00:14:31
So, you know, now I just feelreally bad for "Smelly Cat".

266
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
Honey, I don't thinkeverybody gets "Smelly Cat".

267
00:14:36 --> 00:14:41
I mean, if all you've ever actuallyhad are healthy pets, then whoosh!

268
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
But it's not even that, you know?

269
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
I used to do my songsbecause it made me happy.

270
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
Now it's just allabout the money, you know?

271
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
Well, people missed you in there.

272
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
In fact, there was actuallya request for "Smelly Cat".

273
00:14:56 --> 00:14:57
Really? From who?

274
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
Well, me.

275
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
And I know it's not your bigmoney song, but it's my favorite.

276
00:15:06 --> 00:15:11
Did I accidentally dropa condom in your case?

277
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
It's kind of an emergency.

278
00:15:15 --> 00:15:16
- Here you go.- Thanks a lot.

279
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
Hey, Christine! I got it!

280
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
I want to thank youfor being there for me.

281
00:15:26 --> 00:15:28
And I'm sorryI almost broke your hand.

282
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
That's okay.I'm sorry I poisoned you.

283
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
Remember the time I jammedthat pencil into your hand?

284
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
Remember it? What doyou think this is, a freckle?

285
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
What about the time I hit youin the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

286
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
Remember when I stuckthat broom in your spokes...

287
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
...and you hit your head on the curb?

288
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
But I rememberpeople telling me about it.

289
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
I hope Ben has a little sister.

290
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
And I hope she can kick his ass.

291
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

292
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
How about the time I cutthe legs off your Malibu Ken?

293
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
That was you?

294
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
They were infected.He wouldn't have made it.

295
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
My little nephew.

296
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
Come here, little one!

297
00:16:14 --> 00:16:18
There's my little baby, Ben!

298
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
Hey, he's not crying!

299
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
Hey, he's not crying!

300
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
There's still pie!

301
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
I'm here. I'm here.

302
00:16:37 --> 00:16:38
How's my little boy?

303
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
You want Daddy to changeyour diaper? I know, I know.

304
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
Did you have fun with Uncle Joeyand Uncle Chandler today?

305
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
He rode the bus today.

306
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
Big boy riding the bus...

307
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
Hey, I have a question.

308
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
How come it says,"Property of Human Services"?

309
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
You are gonna love this.

310
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

311
00:17:09 --> 00:17:09
Come here. Come here.

312
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13

313
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
Smelly cat, smelly cat

314
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
What are they feeding you?

315
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
No, no. I'm sorry, it's:

316
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
Smelly cat, smelly cat

317
00:17:29 --> 00:17:33
Smelly cat, smelly cat

318
00:17:33 --> 00:17:34
Better!

319
00:17:34 --> 00:17:35
Much better. Good.

320
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
Don't feel bad,because it's a hard song.

321
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
- You want to try it again?- From the top?

322
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
There is no "top", all right?

323
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat".

324
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
Why don't you just follow me.

325
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
Smelly cat, smelly cat

326
00:17:53 --> 00:17:56
What are they feeding you?

327
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
Smelly cat, smelly cat

328
00:17:59 --> 00:18:02
It's not your fault

329
00:18:02 --> 00:18:05
That's too much. Sorry.
