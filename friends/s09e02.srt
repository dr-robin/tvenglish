1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
You said you'd marry Joey?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
Okay, you have to realize,I was exhausted, I was emotional.

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
I would have said yes to anybody.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
Like that timewhen you and I got married.

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
I'm not helping.

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
So you said yes to him,and you just had our baby?

7
00:00:19 --> 00:00:22
That is right. And traditionally,the daddy gives the mommy a present.

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
But I am prepared to let that go.

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
So when I came here to see if youwanted to maybe start things up again...

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
...you were engaged to my best friend?

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
Well...

12
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
Really?

13
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
I thought Chandlerwas your best friend.

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.Joey's my... No!

15
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
Hey, I'm gonna take off.I just wanted to say goodbye.

16
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
Rachel said she'd marry you?

17
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.

21
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
I don't want to be negative. So I'll saymost of the signs you bought are good.

22
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
No, they ran out of "It's a Girl!"But I can fix this one.

23
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
See? Huh?

24
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
So sexy.

25
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
- Honey?- Yeah?

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
- Honey, why don't you lie down?- It's okay.

27
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
Ross and Rachel will be back soon,and then I gotta go to the office.

28
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
Am I producing them?

29
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
- Why are you so tired?- I couldn't sleep last night.

30
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
I started worrying about this bigdivisional meeting I have today.

31
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
The more I worried,the more I couldn't sleep.

32
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
You know, and then I was, like, "If I fallasleep now, I'll get six hours' sleep.

33
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
But if I fall asleep now,I'll get five hours' sleep."

34
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
No matter what I did,I couldn't fall asleep.

35
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
You know what you should've done?Told yourself that little story.

36
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
- Hi.- Hey.

37
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
- Welcome home.- Hi.

38
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
Phoebe did the signs.

39
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
You guys, thanks for doing this.

40
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Look at all that stuff people sent.

41
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's somethingevery mother needs.

42
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes upthe entire apartment.

43
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
What are people think...?You guys, I love it.

44
00:02:45 --> 00:02:46
Hey, so where's Ross?

45
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
He's downstairs getting the stuffout of the cab.

46
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
- Is he still mad at us?- Well, you more than me.

47
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
But he can't stay too mad at me.I mean, I just had his baby.

48
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
That's not fair. I can't do that.

49
00:02:56 --> 00:02:57
I'm not sure you should be herewhen he comes up.

50
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
I didn't think I should be here either.But somebody said he'd be over it.

51
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
Hey, what do I know?I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

52
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,New York and London are solid.

53
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
But many of our field officeshave reported disappointing yields.

54
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.Houston is down.

55
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
I could go on and on.But instead of boring you...

56
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
...I'll go straight to my 42-point plan.

57
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
Walter.

58
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
She's just so cute.

59
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
I just want to bite her ear offand use it as a sucking candy.

60
00:03:44 --> 00:03:45
Phoebe.

61
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
But I could take one of those little feetand put it in a pita pocket.

62
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
- Okay. I put most of the stuff away.- Oh, great. The pacifiers?

63
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
- It's in the cupboard.- The burping cloths?

64
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
- Linen closet.- The diapers?

65
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
In the hospital.

66
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
- Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy.- No, I left the diapers at the hospital.

67
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
There's some in the bag,but I'll run out and get some more.

68
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
All right, thanks.

69
00:04:08 --> 00:04:09
Could you stop at the coffeehouseand get me a muffin?

70
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
- Sure. What kind?- Let me think.

71
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
What do I want?

72
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
What do I want?

73
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Please, take your time.It's an important decision, not like...

74
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
...say, I don't know, deciding to marrysomeone. This is about a muffin.

75
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
- Blueberry.- Blueberry it is.

76
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
Thank you.

77
00:04:30 --> 00:04:31
Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?

78
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
God, how long do you thinkthat's gonna last?

79
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
I don't know. He got over the"We were on a break" thing quickly.

80
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
You know what,I can't worry about it right now.

81
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Because I've got the cutie little baby.

82
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
I can't believe how much I love her.I mean, I can't get enough of her.

83
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
Like, right now? I miss her.I actually miss her.

84
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
You know, that's her?

85
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
God, look at her sleeping.I love her so much.

86
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
- I think I'm gonna wake her up.- Rach, no.

87
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
You know, you're neversupposed to wake a sleeping baby.

88
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Well, I can do whatever I want.I made her.

89
00:05:05 --> 00:05:09
Come on, little girl.Yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.

90
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
Well, I would say I told you so,but she's kind of doing that for me.

91
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
I'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry.Go back to sleep.

92
00:05:19 --> 00:05:20
Go back to sleep.

93
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
- It breaks your heart, doesn't it?- It really does.

94
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
How long do you thinkwe have to stay?

95
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
Okay, if everyone's on board,it's settled.

96
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Chandler?

97
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
- Chandler?- Yeah.

98
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Are you on board?

99
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
Yes.

100
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Well, then problem solved.Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.

101
00:05:46 --> 00:05:47
You're gonna love Oklahoma.

102
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
All right. We already tried feeding her,changing her, burping her...

103
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
Try this one. "Go back in timeand listen to Phoebe."

104
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
- All right, here's something.- What?

105
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
It says to try holding the babyclose to your body...

106
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
...and then swing her rapidlyfrom side to side.

107
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
Okay.

108
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
It worked!

109
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
No. Just stopped to throw upa little bit.

110
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
Mon, what am I gonna do?

111
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
It's been hours,and it won't stop crying.

112
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
- She, Rach. Not it. She.- Yeah. I'm not so sure.

113
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
- Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.- Yeah, no kidding.

114
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
All right, this just proves no goodcan come from having sex with Ross!

115
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
Hey, Gunther. Can I get a coupleof blueberry muffins to go?

116
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
- Diapers, huh?- Yep.

117
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
So I guess Rachel had your baby?

118
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
- Yep. Can you believe it?- Nope.

119
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
I can't even believeshe slept with you in the first place.

120
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
You mean, like...

121
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
Hey.

122
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
I know you're pissed at me,but we have to talk about this.

123
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
Actually, we don't.

124
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
Fine. Okay. But I gotta say, technically,I didn't even do anything wrong.

125
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

126
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
- I said I didn't technically.- Okay.

127
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Let's put aside the factthat you "accidentally"...

128
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
...picked up my grandmother's ring andyou "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.

129
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Can I just stop you therefor a second?

130
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
When people do this:

131
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
I don't really know what that means.

132
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
You were saying?

133
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
And I could even understandthat you couldn't tell Rachel.

134
00:07:40 --> 00:07:43
But why couldn't you tell me?You had all day to, and you didn't.

135
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
I know. I should've."I'm sorry."

136
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
Not using it right, Joe.

137
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
"I'm sorry."

138
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
- I'm gonna go.- No, come on.

139
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
- Ross, we have to get past this.- Give me the bag.

140
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
No, I don't know what else to do.I said I'm sorry, now...

141
00:08:03 --> 00:08:05
Now you should scream at meor curse me or hit me.

142
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
- I'm not gonna hit you.- You'll feel better. I'll feel better.

143
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
You know you want to,I can see it in your eyes.

144
00:08:11 --> 00:08:12
- I don't.- A little bit.

145
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
- No.- Little bit.

146
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
- No.- A little bit more.

147
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
- Give me the bag. Give me the bag.- No, hit me. Hit me.

148
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
- Give me the bag. I'm not kidding.- Hit me.

149
00:08:21 --> 00:08:22
- No.- Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!

150
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
- You ducked!- I'm sorry! It was a reflex!

151
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
- Oh, my God! This really hurts!- I couldn't help it.

152
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
When a fist comes at your face,you duck. Look.

153
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
What is the matter with you?

154
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
You were supposed to duck!Why didn't you?

155
00:08:47 --> 00:08:48
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.

156
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there,they can check your reflexes.

157
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
- Try feeding her again.- I already fed her.

158
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
I know. That's why I said, "Again!"

159
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
You guys,we can't turn on each other, okay?

160
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
That's just what she wants.

161
00:09:15 --> 00:09:16
- Hi.- Hey.

162
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
- Can I talk to you outside?- Just stay here.

163
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
I'm gonna check her diaper.Pheebs, you want to come?

164
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
I'm kind of part of this.

165
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
Actually, it's a husband-and-wifekind of thing.

166
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
I knew I should've married Chandler.

167
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
- Okay, what's up?- Okay.

168
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
You know we said it would be funto move to Paris for a year?

169
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
And you could study French cooking,and I could write...

170
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
...and we could picnic along the Seine,and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.

171
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
- Yeah.- Okay.

172
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
You know how people saythat Tulsa...

173
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
...is the Paris of Oklahoma?

174
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
What? Who says that?

175
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
People who have never beento Paris?

176
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
- Well, what's going on?- We're moving to Tulsa.

177
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
- Excuse me?- Okay.

178
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
Ms. McKenna,she kind of works above my boss.

179
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
She asked me to move to Tulsa andbe president of our office there.

180
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
And I was sleepingand apparently said yes.

181
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
- Tulsa, Oklahoma?- The Sooner State.

182
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
Whatever that is.

183
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
Chandler, I don't even want to seethe musical "Oklahoma."

184
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,""Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?

185
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
Are you trying to tell me we're movingto Oklahoma or that you're gay?

186
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
All right, not that this matters, but didthey at least offer you a huge raise?

187
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
No. But they are going to lease usa Ford Focus.

188
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
- I'll get out of it.- Thank you.

189
00:10:37 --> 00:10:38
- What is wrong with Emma?- She misunderstood.

190
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.

191
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
Ma'am, do you have a minute?

192
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
I kind of have some bad news.I don't think I can move to Tulsa.

193
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
- What?- It's a funny story, actually.

194
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
I kind of fell asleepin the meeting this morning.

195
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,I didn't really know what I was saying.

196
00:11:00 --> 00:11:01
You fell asleep?

197
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
But only because I was up all nightworried about this meeting.

198
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
Isn't that funny?

199
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
Irony. Not a fan? All right.

200
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
See, here's the thing.

201
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
I went home and told my wifeabout Tulsa, and she won't go.

202
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
See me, I love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.Tulsa is Italy.

203
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19

00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
What a great picture of your son.Strapping.

207
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
That's a picture of your daughter,isn't it?

208
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39

That's weird.Are you sure you're punching right?

213
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
Make a fist.

214
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
Maybe later.

215
00:12:01 --> 00:12:02
Ross, I feel terrible.

216
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
You know what, you can go.I just have to fill out some forms.

217
00:12:10 --> 00:12:11
You want me to help you with that?

218
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
Why, does it look like I'm havingtrouble with my misshapen claw?

219
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
Name?

220
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
No, I know Ross.But what's it short for?

221
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
You know, like Rossell.

222
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
Or Rosstrophor.

223
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
Just Ross.

224
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
It's pretty.

225
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
- Okay, date of birth?- You know my birthday.

226
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37

00:12:41 --> 00:12:45

229
00:12:46 --> 00:12:51
Actually, I'm a paleon...Dinosaurs is fine.

230
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
The drawing is not.

231
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
All right, who do you wantas your emergency contact?

232
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
- Rachel, I guess.- Okay. Relationship?

233
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04

234
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
- Just put roommate.- Come on.

235
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
You guys are more than that.You're gonna get together, right?

236
00:13:12 --> 00:13:13
I don't think that we are.

237
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
But you two are supposedto be together.

238
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
Well, I thought so too.But then she said she'd marry you.

239
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
Come on, Ross,that didn't mean anything.

240
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
She'd just had the baby. She wasfreaked out about doing it alone.

241
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
- She would have said yes to anybody.- Yeah, that's what she said.

242
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
- So?- So I don't want to be just anybody.

243
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
- Wow.- You know what?

244
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
It's better this way anyway.

245
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
I don't know what I was thinking,going down that road again with us.

246
00:13:40 --> 00:13:45
It's just much easier if we'rejust friends who have a kid.

247
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
- Really?- Yeah.

248
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
- And you're okay with that?- Yes. That's what we always planned.

249
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
And if you have a plan,you should stick to it.

250
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
That's why they call them plans.Hello?

251
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
I'm fine.

252
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
Hey, for what it's worth...

253
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
...with Rachel, I don't thinkyou'll ever be just "anybody."

254
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
Hey, there you go.

255
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
"Thanks."

256
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
Oh, my God.How long has she been crying?

257
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
About a week and a half.

258
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
Well, it looks like you guys got itunder control, so I'm just gonna go.

259
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
No? Really?Misery really does love company?

260
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
All right.

261
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
- Try holding her a different way.- Look, I'm doing the best I can.

262
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
- Anyone else is welcome to try.- All right, I'll try. Fine.

263
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
- Yes. Okay. Okay.- Here you go.

264
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
Hey. Oh, gosh.

265
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
Nothing works with this child!

266
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
God, what am I gonna do, you guys?I can't even comfort my own baby.

267
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
- I'm the worst mother ever.- No, you're just new at this.

268
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
You'll get better. Think aboutyour first day at work.

269
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
That couldn't have been easy,but you figured that out.

270
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
Yeah, I don't think dressingprovocatively is going to help me here!

271
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
- God, just please take her.- Okay, I'll take her. Come on.

272
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
Oh, boy,I have to go to the bathroom.

273
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
I have to go scream into a pillow.

274
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.

275
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
Oh, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby.

276
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

277
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
Have I gone deaf?

278
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
It worked. Oh, baby, baby, baby.Oh, baby, baby, baby.

279
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
You must be a fireball in bed!

280
00:15:30 --> 00:15:35
I can't believe it. She's asleep.I got her to go to sleep.

281
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
I have actual magical powers.

282
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
I can hear traffic and birds.

283
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
I can hear the voices in my headagain.

284
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
I'm kidding.

285
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
Oh, my God!You got her to stop crying!

286
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55

00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
- No, no, no.- Thankfully, you don't need me at all.

294
00:16:25 --> 00:16:26

304
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
- What happened to you?- I had a little thing with Joey.

305
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
If you think this is bad,you should see him.

306
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
No, Ross, this is not good.

307
00:17:10 --> 00:17:14
We have to talk about this Joey thing.Please sit.

308
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
All right, you have got to get overthis Joey thing.

I mean, before she wakes up,and we gotta do this all over again.

316

Emma: Not easy.

318
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
Well, that's what I'm here for.

319
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
- You want me to get that?- No, that's really okay.

320
00:17:59 --> 00:18:02

321
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
