Hello.

00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
Hello.

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
I love my new job!

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
- Honey, you're screaming.- You bet your ass I am!

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
I just had the best first day ever!

6
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
The kitchen?Twice as big as Allessandro's.

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
Oh, that's great.

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
And clean? Not just healthdepartment-clean, Monica-clean!

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
Awesome.

10
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
Oh, and the people are so nice.

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
There's this one guy, Jeffrey,he's the maitre d'.

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Chandler, you will love him!

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
He is without a doubtthe funniest guy I have ever met!

17
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
- This is nice.- I know.

18
00:01:30 --> 00:01:32
- You need both hands for that?- Yeah, I kind of do.

19
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
Well, how's this?

20
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
Look at you two holding hands.

21
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
Is this getting serious?

22
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
Have you not talked about it yet?

23
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
Am I making you uncomfortable?

24
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
If you were bigger you'd hit me.

25
00:02:03 --> 00:02:04
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
It's obviously way too earlyfor us to be having that conversation.

27
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
- Is it?- Maybe not. Is it?

28
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
When I got divorced...

29
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
...I didn't think I'd feel this way aboutsomeone for a really long time.

30
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Then again, I didn't think I'd meetsomeone like you. And...

31
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
This may be crazy-soon,but I want you to have this.

32
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
No, not... That's gum.

33
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
Oh, five bucks!I love it when that happens, you know?

34
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
- You don't know it's there...- I know. Keep digging.

35
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
Sorry.

36
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
It's a key.

37
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
To be honest, I think I'd preferthe five dollars.

38
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
- It's to my apartment.- Wow!

39
00:02:41 --> 00:02:42
Big step for Phoebe and Mike.

40
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
I don't want you to feel like youhave to give me your key...

41
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
- No, I want to.- Thank God.

42
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
Wow. I was starting to thinkI'd never meet someone that...

43
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
...I wanted to do this with.

44
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Here you go.

45
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
- This is cool.- It really is.

46
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
I know it. It is amazing.These little things open doors!

47
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
So I don't go back to workfor another four weeks...

48
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
...but we would like our nannyto start right away...

49
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
...so that Emma could geta chance to know her.

50
00:03:12 --> 00:03:13
I think that's really smart.

51
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
The easier we can make thetransition for her the better.

52
00:03:15 --> 00:03:16
That's great. Great.

53
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
- So do you have any questions for us?- Not really.

54
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
All right. Well, thank youso much for coming.

55
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
- Thank you.- It was really nice to meet you.

56
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
- We will call you.- Oh, you know, wait.

57
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
I do have one question.

58
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
Do you guys do random drug testing?

59
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
Boy, we hadn't really thought of that.

60
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
That's cool. But if you do,I'm gonna need three days' notice.

61
00:03:36 --> 00:03:37
Okey-dokey!

62
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
We're never gonna find a nanny.

63
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
Come on, Rach. We will. I promise.We have more interviews.

64
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
Worse comes to worst, we can alwaysreconsider the first one we met with.

65
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
- What, the blond with no bra?- She was blond?

66
00:03:51 --> 00:03:52
Just a sec.

67
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
Okay, this one's name is Sandy.

68
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
She's got a degree inEarly Childhood Education.

69
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
She worked for her last familyfor three years.

70
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
Hi. I'm Sandy.

71
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
And she's a little mannish.

72
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
Oh, my God! David!

73
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
- Is this a bad time?- No, it's a great time! Come in!

74
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Wow! Hi!

75
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?Are you back from Minsk?

76
00:04:27 --> 00:04:28
Just for a couple of days.

77
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
I'm here to explain to the peoplewho gave us our grant...

78
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
...why it's a positive thing thatwe've spent all their money...

79
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
...and accomplished nothing.

80
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
Who cares? It got you here.

81
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
It got me to New York.Then I got in a cab at the airport...

82
00:04:40 --> 00:04:41
...and the guy said, "Where to?"

83
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
I just gave him your address.I didn't even think about it.

84
00:04:46 --> 00:04:47
Where's your luggage?

85
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
Damn it.

86
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
All right, I'll call the cab company.

87
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
We can call them later.Can you just stand there for a moment?

88
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
Boy.

89
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
There's an old Russian expressionthat goes:

90
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Roughly translated, that means:

91
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
"This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."

92
00:05:11 --> 00:05:12
Thank you.

93
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
You should see me when...Actually, no, I look pretty good.

94
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
Are you kidding?

95
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
You know, when you don't seesomeone for a long time...

96
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
...you build them up in your head,you start thinking:

97
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
"Come on, don't be crazy,nobody's that beautiful."

98
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
But, well, you are.

99
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
Well, so are you seeing anyone?

100
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
No.

101
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
I'm just the worst person ever!

102
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
How can I not tell Davidthat I'm seeing Mike?

103
00:05:38 --> 00:05:39
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

104
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
He said, "Are you seeing someone?"And I said, "No."

105
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Well, that would've been your window.

106
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
I mean, I don't know.I was looking in his eyes...

107
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
...and I was just thinking,"Oh, my God, it's David. David's here."

108
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
He's so irresistible.

109
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
- Really? The scientist guy?- Really? Chandler?

110
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
Continue.

111
00:06:04 --> 00:06:05
Then it gets worse...

112
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
...because I told himI would see him tomorrow night.

113
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
- Phoebe!- I know! Evil!

114
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
I like Mike so much, you know?It's just going really well. Oh, my God!

115
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
Isn't it ironic that Davidwould show up...

116
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
...on the same day thatyou and Mike exchange keys?

117
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
Yeah. You know, and givenmy lifelong search for irony...

118
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
...you can imagine how happy I am!

119
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
- What are you gonna do?- I mean, I guess I just have to...

120
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
...tell David that nothingcan happen between us.

121
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
Unless I don't.

122
00:06:36 --> 00:06:37
You know, complicated moral situation?

123
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
- No right, no wrong?- You have to tell David.

124
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
I knew I should've had this conversationwith Joey.

125
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
Funniest guy she's ever met.

126
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
I'm funny, right?

127
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
What do you know? You're a door.

128
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
You just like knock-knock jokes.

129
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Save it for inside.

130
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
So Oklahoma's a crazy place. You know,they call it the Sooner State.

131
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Frankly, I'd sooner be in any other state!

132
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
And what's with Oklahomahaving a panhandle?

133
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
Can all states have stuff like that?

134
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
Hey, yeah, I'm from the waistbandof Wyoming.

135
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
But when I was 7,we headed over to the crotch.

136
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
Was your cabin pressurized?

137
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
And don't get me started on the waythe people from Tulsa talk.

138
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
Okay.

139
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
What's with the word "y'all"? You know,just two words just pushed together?

140
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
Are we all allowed to do that?Because if so, I say why stop there?

141
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
You know, your new poodlecould be your noodle.

142
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
And fried chicken could be fricken.

143
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
Waiter? Waiter, excuse me,I'll have the fricken!

144
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
See, that's funny with the fricken, right?

145
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
No, it just reminds me of somethingthis guy did today at work.

146
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
I told you about that funny guy, Jeffrey,right?

147
00:07:50 --> 00:07:51
Yeah, he came up.

148
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
Well, he did this bit.You probably had to be there...

149
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
...but it was Liza Minnelli lockedin our freezer eating a raw chicken.

150
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
- Were you there?- No, but it sounds fricken funny.

151
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
I really understand how hard it's gotta beto leave your child with another person.

152
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
I mean, it's like leaving behinda piece of your heart.

153
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
Sandy, that's exactly what it is.

154
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
Are you gay?

155
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.

156
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
But I am straight. I'm engaged, actually.

157
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
- Her name's Delia.- That's pretty.

158
00:08:29 --> 00:08:33
So you're just, like,a guy who's a nanny.

159
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
I realize how it's a bit unorthodoxfor some people.

160
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
But I really believe the most satisfyingthing you can do with your life...

161
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
...is take care of a child.

162
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
Okay.

163
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
Like at my last job.

164
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
I met Daniel when he was3 weeks old.

165
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
And I got to watch him growinto this awesome person.

166
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
When I left, I said, "I'll see you soon."

167
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
And he said to me, "Skadandy?"

168
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
That was his name for me.

169
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
"I'll see you every day right in..."

170
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
- It's okay.- Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.

171
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
Oh, God, she must needher diaper changed.

172
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
- I can take care of that, if you want.- That would be great.

173
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
I love him, I love him, I love him!

174
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
Come on. Rach, he's a guy!

175
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
So what? He's smart. He's qualified.

176
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
Give me one good reasonwe shouldn't try him out.

177
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
Because it's weird!

178
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
Why?

179
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
What kind of a job is that for a man?A nanny?

180
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
I mean, it's like if a womanwanted to be...

181
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
Yes?

182
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
King?

183
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
I hope you don't mind. I usedsome of my homemade lotion on Emma.

184
00:09:49 --> 00:09:53
It's a mixture of calendula andhoney cream. It'll dry that rash right up.

185
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
Plus, it keeps the hands young.

186
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
Yes! Sandy, you're hired!

187
00:10:03 --> 00:10:04
That's great!

188
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
It's just such an emotional thingwhen you're welcomed into a new family.

190
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
Oh, God. Come here.

191
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
You gotta be at least bi.

192
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
I need you to set me up for a joke.

193
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
When Monica's around,ask me about fire trucks.

194
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
I don't know, Chandler. I'm notso good with remembering lines.

195
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
Thank God your livelihooddoesn't depend on it.

196
00:10:43 --> 00:10:44
I know, right?

197
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
Why are we doing this?

198
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
Monica says that her maitre d' isthe funniest guy she's ever met.

199
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
- Seriously? She actually said that?- Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?

200
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
- No! Being funny's your thing!- Yeah!

201
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
Without that, you just got"lame with women"!

202
00:10:59 --> 00:11:00
Hi! There you are.

203
00:11:00 --> 00:11:01
Fire trucks!

204
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
Wow. You look even more beautifulthan you did yesterday.

205
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
In fact, I'm going to kiss you now.

206
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
- Wait, wait.- I can't get away with stuff like that.

207
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22
It sounded sexy in my head, so I...

208
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
No, no, it's not that.

209
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
Remember when you asked me ifI was seeing someone and I said no?

210
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
Well, I am. His name's Mike.

211
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
- I should've told you.- No.

212
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Well, yeah.

213
00:11:39 --> 00:11:43
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.- Well, it's okay. I understand.

214
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
Well, are you happy with this guy?

215
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
- I am happy.- Damn it.

216
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
I'm sorry. I don't mean that.I want you to be happy.

217
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
But only with me. No, that's not fair.Who cares. Leave him.

218
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
I don't mean that. Yes, I do.I'm sorry.

219
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
I think I should probably go.

220
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
But, David, I just want you to know that,you know...

221
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
...telling you this is one of thehardest things I've ever had to do.

222
00:12:07 --> 00:12:08
Well, just so you know...

223
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
...hearing it wasn't exactlya Vladnik carnival, either.

224
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
- Can we at least hug goodbye?- Of course. Yeah.

225
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
You know, and a kiss on the cheekwouldn't be totally inappropriate.

226
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
- No. No.- I mean...

227
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
- In Minsk?- Yeah?

228
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
It's two on each cheek...

229
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
...and one on the lips.- Well, if that's what they do in Minsk.

230
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
In New York, it's...

231
00:12:51 --> 00:12:52
Oh, boy.

232
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
Is everything all right?

233
00:12:57 --> 00:12:58
Oh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's fine.

234
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
Sandy was just telling me about how heproposed to his fiancee...

235
00:13:02 --> 00:13:03
...and it was so beautiful.

236
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
Her favorite flower is the camellia.From the poem...

237
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
I can't hear it again!

238
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
You know, I can't tell it again!

239
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
And I'm fine never having heard it.

240
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
- Rach, can I see you for a sec?- Yeah. Excuse me.

241
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
Do you realize that man has criedin our apartment three times?

242
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
I haven't cried that many timessince I moved in!

243
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.That's all.

244
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
Okay, okay. See, that is the problem.He is too sensitive.

245
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

246
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
No, I mean, that guy...These are amazing!

247
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
Sandy made madeleines.

248
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
This is exactlywhat I'm talking about.

249
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
What kind of a guy makes delicateFrench cookies?

250
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
They're not even butch,manly cookies with...

251
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
You know, with chunks!

252
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
Well, you know,I don't know what to say.

253
00:13:58 --> 00:14:02
I mean, I never thought of you as a guywho needed his men to be men.

254
00:14:02 --> 00:14:06
I gotta tell you, Ross, it's not like youjust came in from branding cattle.

255
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
Hey, there's sensitive andthere's too sensitive.

256
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
Okay, what is too sensitive?

257
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
No, I can't. I can't do this. It's bad.

258
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
But it's nice. And nice is good.

259
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
And good is not bad.Ergo, we should keep kissing.

260
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
- No, no. No.- But...

261
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
Ergo.

262
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
Look, David, if you had never left, then...

263
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
...yeah, we'd probably still be togetherright now.

264
00:14:54 --> 00:14:59
But you did leave. And I'm with Mikeand I really care about him.

265
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
Goodbye.

266
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
The key works.

267
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
And, you, thanks for the face massage!Thank you!

268
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
Did Rachel tell you we hireda male nanny?

269
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
I think that's great!

270
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
Did she tell you he plays the recorder,recites poetry and bakes madeleines?

271
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
- How are they?- Lighter than air, but that's not the point.

272
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

273
00:15:37 --> 00:15:38
Really?

274
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
Guys do that?

275
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
- That's weird.- Thank you!

276
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
- That's like a woman wanting to be...- What?

277
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
- What's the end of that sentence?- Yes. What is the end of that sentence?

278
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
A penis model!

279
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
Anyway, did you tell Chandlerthat some guy from work...

280
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
...is the funniest guy you ever met?

281
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
- Yeah. So?- Wow!

282
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
Really? Do you not know Chandler?

283
00:16:06 --> 00:16:10
Is that why he's acting so weird?He's jealous?

284
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
Oh, my God, that is crazy.

285
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
- It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey.- So what?

286
00:16:13 --> 00:16:17
Being funny is Chandler's thing.Like Ross' thing is...

287
00:16:21 --> 00:16:22
Science?

288
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
Academia? Being a good father?

289
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
- I can't believe he's that upset.- You have to do some damage control.

290
00:16:32 --> 00:16:33
Because he's feeling like...

291
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
What are you guys talking about?

292
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

293
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
You got a man who's a nanny?

294
00:16:44 --> 00:16:45
You got a "manny"?

295
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
You know, I don't mind a male nanny...

296
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
...but I do draw the lineat male wet nurse.

297
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
You are on a roll, mister!

298
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
If I'd known you guys were coming over,I would've brought more pizza.

299
00:17:07 --> 00:17:10
Okay! Okay! Stop it, you!You stop it!

300
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
What is so funny about that?

301
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
I don't know, it's...Just the way you say it.

302
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
I mean, you're funny. You havethat funny thing. You're a funny guy!

303
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
Did you tell her what we talked about?

304
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
So those were pity laughs?Pity laughs?!

305
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
Honey, listen.

306
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
You have nothing to worry aboutwith Jeffrey.

307
00:17:40 --> 00:17:41
Oh, yeah? Is he funnier than me?

308
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
Well, you're different funny.

309
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
I mean, you're more sarcastic.

310
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
Well, he does bits and impressionsand limericks.

311
00:17:49 --> 00:17:50
I do limericks.

312
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
There once was a man named Chandlerwhose wife made him die inside.

313
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious.

314
00:17:58 --> 00:17:59
You know that jokeyou told me last week?

315
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
The one about Jerry Lewisand the girl with the lazy eye.

316
00:18:02 --> 00:18:03
That slayed me.

317
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
Hey! I made up that jokeand told it to you.

318
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
- Not knowing when to shut up.- Yep, that's my thing.

319
00:18:18 --> 00:18:20
So how many guys have your key?

320
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23
It's not as bad as it looks.

321
00:18:23 --> 00:18:24
I was saying goodbye to an old friend.

322
00:18:25 --> 00:18:26
Your lipstick's on his mouth.

323
00:18:27 --> 00:18:29
We just happen to wear the same shade.

324
00:18:31 --> 00:18:33
No, David and I did used to go out.

325
00:18:33 --> 00:18:37
But years ago. And he lives in Minsk.He's only in town for a couple days.

326
00:18:38 --> 00:18:39
- Did you...?- No. No.

327
00:18:39 --> 00:18:41
- Kiss him?- Oh, well, yeah.

328
00:18:42 --> 00:18:44
Yes, but you should know,she really likes you.

329
00:18:45 --> 00:18:47
In fact, I don't think you realizejust how lucky you are, fella.

330
00:18:48 --> 00:18:49
- Don't point your finger at me!- Why?

331
00:18:50 --> 00:18:51
What are you gonna do about it?

332
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
Well, I'll show youwhat I'm gonna do about it.

333
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
- Oh, really? Really?- You want some of that?

334
00:18:58 --> 00:19:01
Stop it! Stop it!Before someone gets really hurt!

335
00:19:03 --> 00:19:05
Here, David, you should just go.

336
00:19:05 --> 00:19:06
All right.

337
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
But if I ever do come back from Minsk,well, you just better watch out.

338
00:19:11 --> 00:19:14
- Lf I go to Minsk, you better watch out.- Oh, you're going to Minsk?

339
00:19:14 --> 00:19:16
- Well, I might.- Really?

340
00:19:16 --> 00:19:19
Well, if you do, come in the spring.It's just lovely there.

341
00:19:19 --> 00:19:21
Okay, well, guys?

342
00:19:22 --> 00:19:24
- Goodbye, Phoebe.- Bye.

343
00:19:24 --> 00:19:27
- Hey, what, are you kidding me?- Right-o. Right-o.

344
00:19:30 --> 00:19:31
Take good care of her.

345
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

346
00:19:35 --> 00:19:38
If you want your key back,I totally understand.

347
00:19:39 --> 00:19:42
- It's never gonna happen again, right?- Right. Never. I swear.

348
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
I just want to say, if you do evercome to Minsk, that's my number.

349
00:19:48 --> 00:19:51
We'll party up Vladnik-style.

350
00:20:04 --> 00:20:05
Yeah! All right!

351
00:20:05 --> 00:20:09
Hey, Ross! Check it out!Sandy taught me "Hot Cross Buns"!

352
00:20:09 --> 00:20:11
Really? Sounded like "Three Blind Mice."

353
00:20:11 --> 00:20:14
- "Three Blind Mice" goes like this.- I swear to God.

354
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
- Who's up for puppets?- Me! I'm up for puppets!

355
00:20:20 --> 00:20:22
Well, please welcome:

356
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
The Snufflebumps!

357
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
Who wants to be Mr. Wigglemunch andwho's gonna be the Grumpus?

358
00:20:27 --> 00:20:31
How exactly is a 2-month-oldsupposed to appreciate puppets?

359
00:20:31 --> 00:20:35
Studies show that the movement andcolors help their cerebral development.

360
00:20:35 --> 00:20:37
The whimsical characters are just for us.

361
00:20:41 --> 00:20:43
I want to be Mr. Wigglemunch!

362
00:20:44 --> 00:20:45
Oh, my God.

363
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
Well, I guess we know who'sgonna be the Grumpus!

364
00:20:52 --> 00:20:54
- That was kind of rude.- Oh, I'm sorry.

365
00:20:54 --> 00:20:57
Please apologize to Sandyand the Snufflebumps for me.

366
00:20:58 --> 00:21:00
- You know, he was just doing his job.- You know what?

367
00:21:00 --> 00:21:05
I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn'tin love with Gary Poppins out there.

368
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
But I just... I can't go through with this.

369
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
- Come on.- No! You know what?

370
00:21:11 --> 00:21:15
I would never force you to hire someoneyou were this uncomfortable with.

371
00:21:18 --> 00:21:19
That's true.

372
00:21:19 --> 00:21:20
Thank you.

373
00:21:20 --> 00:21:22
You want to fire him,so you have to go do it.

374
00:21:25 --> 00:21:29
So you see, Wigglemunch,that's why it's important to share.

375
00:21:31 --> 00:21:34
I am learning so much from you.

376
00:21:38 --> 00:21:39
Well, I'm off to Tulsa.

377
00:21:39 --> 00:21:42
So if your maitre d' friendhas any funny Oklahoma jokes...

378
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
...tell him to e-mail me atwww-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com!

379
00:21:47 --> 00:21:49
Honey, you can relax.

380
00:21:49 --> 00:21:51
Last night at work Jeffreytold this really sexist joke.

381
00:21:52 --> 00:21:54
- After that, not so funny anymore.- Really?

382
00:21:54 --> 00:21:57
See, that's the thing.You gotta keep it smart, people!

383
00:21:58 --> 00:22:00
Don't miss that flight.You know I love you.

384
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
I love you too.

385
00:22:02 --> 00:22:05
- And I like you as a friend.- Right.

386
00:22:05 --> 00:22:07
- See you later.- See you.

387
00:22:09 --> 00:22:11
- Did the guy really make that joke?- No, he still kills me.

388
00:22:11 --> 00:22:15
Last night he had me laughing so hard,I swear a little pee came out.

389
00:22:22 --> 00:22:23
Here goes.

390
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.

391
00:22:29 --> 00:22:30
Sandy? Hi.

392
00:22:30 --> 00:22:32
- Hi.- We...

393
00:22:32 --> 00:22:33
We kind of need to talk.

394
00:22:37 --> 00:22:38
I'm afraid it's not working out.

395
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
I mean, Rachel and I think you are greatwith Emma.

396
00:22:47 --> 00:22:49
- We just feel...- You! You feel!

397
00:22:50 --> 00:22:54
I just feel...

398
00:22:54 --> 00:22:56
...that the chemistry isn't right.I'm sorry.

399
00:22:57 --> 00:22:59
We're more than happy to give youa good recommendation.

400
00:22:59 --> 00:23:02
No, that's okay. I had a lot of offersfrom other families.

401
00:23:03 --> 00:23:04
I just picked you guys because...

402
00:23:05 --> 00:23:08
...I liked you the best.- Oh, damn you, Geller!

403
00:23:10 --> 00:23:13
Anyway, well I'm gladthere's no hard feelings.

404
00:23:13 --> 00:23:17
None at all. You need to be happywith whoever is in your home.

405
00:23:17 --> 00:23:20
Although, if you don't mind telling me...

406
00:23:20 --> 00:23:23
...what was the problem? Maybe it'ssomething I can work on in the future.

407
00:23:23 --> 00:23:28
No, you know, it's nothing you did.It's my issue.

408
00:23:29 --> 00:23:30
What is it?

409
00:23:32 --> 00:23:33
Please?

410
00:23:36 --> 00:23:41
You know, I'm just not that comfortablewith a guy who's as sensitive as you.

411
00:23:42 --> 00:23:43
That's fair.

412
00:23:44 --> 00:23:47
Although, can I ask,why do you think that is?

413
00:23:47 --> 00:23:49
Why? I don't know.

414
00:23:55 --> 00:23:57
Maybe because of my father?

415
00:24:00 --> 00:24:02
You know, when I was growing up,he was a tough guy.

416
00:24:03 --> 00:24:07
You know, and as a kid,I wasn't the athlete I am now.

417
00:24:08 --> 00:24:10
I play squash!

418
00:24:13 --> 00:24:18
Anyway, I always got the feelinghe thought I was too sensitive.

419
00:24:18 --> 00:24:19
That must have been hard.

420
00:24:20 --> 00:24:22
It was hard.

421
00:24:23 --> 00:24:27
I remember I was in my bedroom,playing with my dinosaurs...

422
00:24:28 --> 00:24:29
Playing and learning.

423
00:24:31 --> 00:24:36
And my father walks in and says,"What are you doing with those things?

424
00:24:36 --> 00:24:41
What's wrong with you? Why aren't yououtside playing like a real boy?"

425
00:24:41 --> 00:24:44
- But you are a real boy.- I know I am!

426
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
And when it's summer and it's hot,why can't you wear a tank top?!

427
00:24:51 --> 00:24:56
It's all right. Crying is good.It lets the boo-hoos out.

428
00:24:57 --> 00:24:59
Here comes some more!

429
00:25:04 --> 00:25:07
And what's the one kind of boatthat can never ever sink?

430
00:25:07 --> 00:25:11
- What kind?- A friend ship!

431
00:25:13 --> 00:25:15
Wow! You blow my mind!

432
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
I gotta go.

433
00:25:19 --> 00:25:20
- How much do I owe you?- Twenty bucks.

434
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
It's like the cheapest college ever!

435
00:25:27 --> 00:25:28
