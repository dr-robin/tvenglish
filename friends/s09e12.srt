1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
- Where's Mon?- She's at home...

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
...putting up decorationsfor Rachel's birthday party tonight.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
- You're not helping?- I tried...

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
...but apparently singing "I Will Survive"in a helium voice, not helping.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
- Hey, guys.- Hey.

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
Don't say that loud.Gunther's gonna want to hug me.

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
Good news, everyone.We finally found a nanny.

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
- This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey.- Hi.

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
Somebody's getting a little fussy.

10
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
You're damn right I am. I've beenwaiting for a cookie for seven minutes.

11
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
Okay. You know what,I'm just gonna take her outside.

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
- No, you stay. I'll do it.- Okay. Thank you.

13
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
- Nice to meet you guys.- Yeah, you too.

14
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
- Wow, Molly's just great.- Yeah.

15
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

16
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
- What? You really think she's hot?- Are you kidding?

17
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
If I wasn't married,she'd be rejecting me right now.

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
Joey?

19
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
How do you think she's doing?

20
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
Am I the only one that doesn't thinkshe's hot? Ross?

21
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
- I mean, she's not unattractive, but...- Right.

22
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
...but hot?

23
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
Thank you.

24
00:01:10 --> 00:01:11
Now that Rachel's gone?

25
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
So hot, I cried myself to sleeplast night.

29
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
Hey, Mike,what's the capital of Peru?

30
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
- Lima.- No.

31
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
It starts with a Vand ends with an X.

32
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
And hopefully with a T-Oin the middle.

33
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
You know, come to think of it,the capital of Peru is "Vtox."

34
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
- Oh, God!- What?

35
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
Okay. I don't want to freak you outor anything...

36
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
...but I just saw a ratin your cupboard.

37
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.

38
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
Well, he's your pet rat?

39
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Well, not so much a pet as, you know,an occasional visitor...

40
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
...who I put food out for.Kind of like Santa.

41
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
Except Santa doesn't poopon the plate of cookies.

42
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.They're unsanitary.

43
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
I mean, they transmit leptospirosisand hantavirus.

44
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
- What are those?- I don't know...

45
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
...but they don't soundlike spa treatments.

46
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
- You have to get rid of it.- Okay, fine.

47
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
If it means that much to you,I'll get rid of Bob.

48
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
Thank you.

49
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
It's so weird you think he's so gross,yet you're willing to eat his crackers.

50
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
- Hello.- Hello.

51
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
Gavin, I just want to saythank you again...

52
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
...for watching Emma yesterdayduring the presentation.

53
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
I really owe you an apology.

54
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
- For what?- When we first met, you know...

55
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
...I thought you were pompousand arrogant and obnoxious.

56
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
Is this your first apology?

57
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
No, I just mean, you know,first impressions don't mean anything.

58
00:03:13 --> 00:03:17
And I think you're a really good guy.And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

59
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
- Morning.- Hello.

60
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
But you know what?Hey, new day, new leaf.

61
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
I am just really, really happy...

62
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
I'm sorry. Obviously, Heather's asshas something more important to say...

63
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
...so I'll just wait till it's finished.

64
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
- What?- I was giving you an apology...

65
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
...and you were totallychecking her out.

66
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
I wasn't. I'm in fashion.I was looking at her skirt.

67
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
Or was it pants? I didn't really seewhat happened below the ass area.

68
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
Wow, you are really...You're really a creep.

69
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
What do you careif I was looking at her?

70
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
Are you jealous?

71
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
Oh, yeah. I'm jealous.

72
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
"Oh, Gavin. Please,please look at my ass."

73
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
Stop looking at my ass!

74
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
I mean, I just thinkyou are totally inappropriate. Okay?

75
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
This is a work environment.She's your subordinate.

76
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
But it was okay when youslept with your old assistant, Tag?

77
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
That is totally differentfor two reasons.

78
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
One: I didn't knowthat you knew that.

79
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
And two: I wasn't some creepstaring at his ass.

80
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
We had a... We had a deep,meaningful relationship.

81
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
What was Tag's last name?

82
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
It was...

83
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
He didn't... He didn't...He didn't have a last name.

85
00:04:26 --> 00:04:31
It was just Tag, you know,like Cher or...

86
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
...you know, Moses.

87
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
But it was a deep,meaningful relationship.

88
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
You know what? My first impressionof you was absolutely right.

89
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
You are arrogant. You are pompous.Morgan! Morgan!

90
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
- Tag's last name was Morgan!- It was Jones.

91
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
What are you, his boyfriend?

92
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
- Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.- You mean when you were a baby?

93
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
Sure.

94
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
Would you stop staring at her?

95
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
I wasn't staring.

96
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
I was leering.

97
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
What's the big deal with her?

98
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
Maybe she's attractivein an obvious kind of way.

99
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.

100
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
You know, when it's right therein your face.

101
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
Me, I like to have to workto find someone attractive.

102
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
Makes me feel like I earned it.

103
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
Looks like Joey's doing all rightwith her.

104
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guysto back off...

105
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
...and let Joey get the girl for once.

106
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
- I'm gonna take her to the apartment.- Okay. I'll be home right after work.

107
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
- Okay.- Okay, bye, Emma.

108
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
I love you.

109
00:05:32 --> 00:05:33
- Bye.- Bye.

110
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
They've elected me to talk to youabout the baby talk.

111
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
It's not so good.

112
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
I think it's sweet.

113
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
Bye, Emma!

114
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, I wouldreally prefer if you didn't go after her.

115
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
- Why not?- It took months to find a good nanny.

116
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
And I wouldn't want anything to,you know, drive her away.

117
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
So you think I'm justgonna sleep with her...

118
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
...and never call her again, andthings are gonna get uncomfortable?

119
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
Yeah, that sounds about right.

120
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
Come on, there are plentyof other women out there.

121
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
Just forget about her, okay?She's off-limits.

122
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
Oh, man! What'd you have to goand say that for?

123
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
Now that you told me I can't have her,makes me want her even more!

124
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
- What are you, a child?- Yes!

125
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
Look, Joey, come on now.For me, please.

126
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
Just try to focus your sexual energyon someone else.

127
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
Fine.

128
00:06:28 --> 00:06:28
Take me home.

129
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
- Hey, Mikey.- Hey, Pheeb.

130
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
- What are you doing?- Setting rattraps.

131
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
- To kill Bob?- No. No, to test his neck strength.

132
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
No, I don't want to kill him.I thought we were gonna capture him...

133
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
...and, you know, set him freein the countryside...

134
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
...where he could meeta friendly possum...

135
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
...and a wisecracking owl.

136
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
- Okay, okay. I'll throw away the traps.- All right, I'll find Bob. I'll get him.

137
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
Bob? Bob?

138
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
Robert?

139
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
Wait, I think I hear him.

140
00:07:02 --> 00:07:07
Oh, my God! Bob had babies!Bob's a mom!

141
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
We'll have to think of a new name.

142
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
I don't know,I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.

143
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
No, no. I mean, I'm not sure that we...

144
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
Oh, my God. We killed Bob?

145
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
Well, maybe it wasn't Bob.Maybe it was a mouse.

146
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Susie?

147
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
What's up?

148
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
Seriously, dude. Three years ago.

149
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
Listen, can you do me a favor?I'm gonna be out today.

150
00:07:33 --> 00:07:34
Can you keep an eye on Joey...

151
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
...make sure nothing happensbetween him and Molly?

152
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
- You don't trust him?- Well, no.

153
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Some woman who soundeda lot like Joey called earlier...

154
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
...and asked for her daughter,the "hot nanny."

155
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
Is this your long-term plan,for me to run interference?

156
00:07:47 --> 00:07:50
Because I could get a job any day now.

157
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
You do appear right on the cuspof something.

158
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
Look, come on, man. I'm surehe'll lose interest in a week or two...

159
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
...but for now, could you pleasejust do this for me?

160
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
Fine, but don't blame meif it doesn't work.

161
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
Because you know once Joeysets his mind on something...

162
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
...more often than not,he's going to have sex with it.

163
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Well, I mean,we've gotta do something. Okay?

164
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
Nannies like her don't grow on trees.

165
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
- Picturing that tree?- I am, yes.

166
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
Where you going, Joe?

167
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
For a walk.

168
00:08:28 --> 00:08:29
You mind if I join you?

169
00:08:29 --> 00:08:34
Actually, I'd rather be alone. You know,I really need to organize my thoughts.

170
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Your thoughts?

171
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
Plural?

172
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
All right, fine.I only have one thought.

173
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
It's about the hot nanny!I gotta see her!

174
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
- I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.- Now you're saying I can't see her?

175
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
You're killing me! She's forbidden fruit!It's like, like...

176
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
...like she's the princessand I'm the stable boy.

177
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
Why are you doing this, huh?

178
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
Did Ross tell you not to let mego over there?

179
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.So I can't let you go.

180
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
Interesting. Now there are obstacles.

181
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
Hot nanny and me against the world!

182
00:09:09 --> 00:09:10
This is the stuff great novelsare made of.

183
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
- Great novels?- Fine. Mediocre porn.

184
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
- Gavin Mitchell's office.- Rachel Greene's office.

185
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
Give me that phone.

186
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
Hello, this is Rachel Greene.How can I help you?

187
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
Okay then.I'll pass you back to your son.

00:09:33 --> 00:09:36

193
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
Thank God you finally said that.

194
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
I saw you make a note on your padthree hours ago.

195
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
- Man, I really bug you. Don't I?- Oh, no. Please...

196
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
...I don't care about youenough to bug me.

197
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58

198
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
...and I'm going to be very, very niceto you, you mama's boy...

205
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
- Pleased to meet you.- Pleased to meet you.

206
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
Are you coming to Rachel's party?

207
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
Oh, no, no, no, no. Gavin can't.He already has plans...

208
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
...most likely with his mother.

209
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
I don't mind. I'll cancel them. I wouldnever miss my secretary's birthday.

210
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
Why did you invite him?I can't stand that guy!

211
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
- You were being so nice to him.- I was faking it.

212
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
Can't you tell when I'm being fake?

213
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
Hey, Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.

214
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
Right there.That was so fake!

215
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
I still can't believe you invited Gavin.

216
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
He is just the last personI want to see.

217
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
You're welcome for the party.I'm glad you're having a good time.

218
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
I hope he doesn't show up.Of course he won't, the guy hates me.

219
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
- Does he?- What?

220
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
Maybe he keeps bothering youso much because he likes you.

221
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
It's like in first gradewhen Skippy Lange would push me...

222
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
...because he secretlyhad a crush on me.

223
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
Monica, you think Skippy liked you?

224
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Honey, all those boys had a betto see if he could knock you over.

225
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
- She's out. I'm gonna take her home.- Okay. Thank you.

226
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
Bye, sweetheart.

227
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
Do you see what all the guyssee in her?

228
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.

229
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
No more vodka for me.

230
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
Hey, Rach. So can I sing"Happy Birthday" to you now?

231
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
- Yeah, sure.- All right.

232
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
See you later.

233
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.

234
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
Give me!

235
00:11:41 --> 00:11:45
- Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!- Careful! Careful!

236
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
These are my rat babies!

237
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
Yeah. We have rat babies now.

238
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
You brought ratsto my birthday party?

239
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
So this is what a stroke feels like.

240
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
Well, I had to bring them.We killed their mother.

241
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
They're our responsibility now.

242
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
You know, they require constant care.You should know that, you're a mother.

243
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
Are you comparing my daughterto a rat?

244
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
No. Seven rats.

245
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
We should take them home.We need to feed them.

246
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
You're gonna leave my partyto take care of a box of rats?

247
00:12:18 --> 00:12:19
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel,but I'm not like you. Okay?

248
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
Not everyone can afford help.

249
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
Hey, where the hellare Joey and Molly?

250
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
I asked you to watch them.

251
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
I'm sorry. I got a little preoccupied.

252
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
Look, we have to stop thembefore something happens.

253
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
Right behind you, big guy.

254
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
So you see, Molly,what people don't understand...

255
00:12:42 --> 00:12:45
...is that acting is a discipline.It takes a lot of hard work.

256
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
- So where'd you study?- I didn't go to college.

257
00:12:47 --> 00:12:52
- No, where'd you study acting?- Molly, people don't study acting.

258
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
Molly, do you mind giving usjust a minute?

259
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
- Sure. I'll go check on Emma.- Thanks.

260
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Will the stable boynever get the princess?

261
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
What do you think you were gonna do,have sex with her here on my couch?

262
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
No. The leather sticks to my ass.

263
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
This isn't fair. What makes you thinkI'm gonna sleep with her...

264
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
...and then blow her off, huh?

265
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
Can't you guys open your minds tothe possibility that I actually like her...

266
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
...and might want something real?

267
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
Look, the truth is, I haven't feltthis way about anyone since Rachel.

268
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
Okay?I didn't think I could ever love again.

269
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
- Come on!- Joe!

270
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
Hi. Is Molly here?

271
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
Yeah, yeah. Come on in. Molly?

272
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
- Hey. Guys, this is Tabitha.- Hey.

273
00:13:44 --> 00:13:47
- I'll see you tomorrow.- Okay.

274
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
Well, Joey, I guesswe have no problem.

275
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
It's like my favorite fairy talecome true.

276
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
The princess, the stable boyand the lesbian.

277
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
Okay. Okay,you start preparing the formula...

278
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
...and I'll start changing the box.

279
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
And then we gotta put themstraight to bed.

280
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
When did we becomeone of those couples...

281
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
...whose lives revolve aroundtheir rats?

282
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
Well, you know what?They're our responsibility now.

283
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
Okay, fine.These rats are our responsibility.

284
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
What happens when they mateand there are hundreds?

285
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.

286
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
Yeah, not such a problem with rats.

287
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
No, they're more of a "love the oneyou're with" kind of animal.

288
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
No. Really?

289
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
Oh, my... Get off your sister!

290
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

291
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
The... We have seven rats.

292
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
So, what if each of themhas seven rats...

293
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
...and then each of thosehas seven rats? That's like...

294
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
That's math I can't even do!

295
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
What are we gonna do?

296
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
Well, I know this is gonnasound crazy...

297
00:15:01 --> 00:15:06
...but we couldnot let the box of rats ruin our lives.

298
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.

299
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
All right, so we should justgive them away.

300
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
But to nice families with childrenand reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

301
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
Those were Bob's favorites.

302
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
It's gonna be okay.

303
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
- You must think I'm crazy.- No, I think you're sweet.

304
00:15:26 --> 00:15:31
Good. This is just so hard.It's hard for me to let them go.

305
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
I guess it just brings back memories,you know...

306
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
...from when I gave birth to my brother'striplets and I had to give them up.

307
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
I haven't told you about that yet,have I?

308
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
Thanks for the party, honey.Should I help you clean up?

309
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
No way. You had your party.Now I have mine.

310
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
- Is everything all right?- I just get bummed...

311
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
...when my birthday's over.

312
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
Well, at least you have one thingto be happy about.

313
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
That jerk, Gavin, from your officedidn't show up.

314
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
Yeah, I hate him.

315
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
We weren't talking about you.We were...

316
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.

317
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
- Fun party.- Well, it was.

318
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
And you would have seen itif you didn't show up at...

319
00:16:29 --> 00:16:33
9:30?! God! This party was lame.

320
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
Again, you're welcome!

321
00:16:36 --> 00:16:40
- Look, I'll just give you this and go.- You bought me a present. Why?

322
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
Let me explain how birthday partiesusually work. There are presents...

323
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
...and a cake,perhaps a fourth or fifth person.

324
00:16:48 --> 00:16:49
Okay, I...

325
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
I got you the present to make upfor being such a jerk to you.

326
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
Well, okay. Well, that's very nice.And you wrote a card.

327
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
- "From Gavin."- I really mean it.

328
00:17:05 --> 00:17:06
It's beautiful.

329
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
If you don't mind...?Let me.

330
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
Well, what do you know, it fits.

331
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18
See, Gavin. You're capable of beinga nice guy.

332
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
Why do you give me such a hard time?

333
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
I'm not sure.

334
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
Well, Monica seems to thinkit's because you have feelings for me.

335
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
I do have feelings for you.

336
00:17:29 --> 00:17:32
- You do?- Yes. I feel that you're a little annoying.

337
00:17:33 --> 00:17:34
See, why? Gavin, why?

338
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
Right when I'm about to changemy opinion of you, you go and you...

339
00:17:40 --> 00:17:43
And you do that.

340
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
Hey. Listen, I think I left somethinghere.

341
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
Well, somebody left this.Is this yours?

342
00:18:10 --> 00:18:11
No, but I like it.

343
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
No, I think I left one of my rat babies.

344
00:18:16 --> 00:18:18
Well, no. I haven't seen it,but if I do, I'll let you know.

345
00:18:18 --> 00:18:21
Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!Rat baby!

346
00:18:22 --> 00:18:23
Maybe that's him.

347
