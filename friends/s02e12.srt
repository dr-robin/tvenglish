00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
Can't get the monkey off your back?

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Then put it in your mouth...

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
... with Monkeyshine Beer!

6
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Get it, monkey

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
Get it, get it, monkey

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:21
Monkey, monkey

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
Monkeyshine Beer.

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
Because it's a jungle out there!

11
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
That commercial alwaysmakes me so sad.

12
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
But then the guy opens his beerand girls run at him...

13
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
...so everything works out okay.

14
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
I meant because the monkeyreminds me of Marcel.

15
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
I can see that.

16
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
Because they both have those bigbrown eyes and the little pouty chin.

17
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
And the fact thatthey're both monkeys?

18
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
I wonder if I did the right thing,giving him away.

19
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
Ross, you had to. He washumping everything in sight.

20
00:00:47 --> 00:00:52
My Malibu Barbie will no longerbe wearing white to her wedding.

21
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

22
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
...and when you got it back,there'd be monkey raisins in it?

23
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
When he did it, it was funny.When I did it to my boss's hat...

24
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
Suddenly, I had this big"attitude problem".

00:01:45 --> 00:01:46
Hey, check it out!Guess what I got?

28
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
Rhythm?

29
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
No. My first fan mail!

30
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
"Dear Dr. Ramoray:

31
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
I love you and would doanything to have you."

32
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
My gosh! "Your not-so-secretadmirer, Erika Ford."

33
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
Oh, wait.

34
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
"P.S. Enclosed, please find14 of my eyelashes."

35
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
In Crazy World, that meansyou're married.

36
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
It's not addressed to "Days Of Our Lives".This came to your apartment.

37
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
She was in our building.

38
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
I got my very own stalker!

40
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
Where are you off to?

41
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
There's a paleontologyconference in L.A.

42
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
So I figured I'd go and drive downto the zoo and surprise Marcel.

43
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
He will be surprised.Till he realizes he's a monkey...

44
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
...and isn't capable of that emotion.

45
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
Phoebe? That really cute guyis here again.

46
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
Okay, so everyone...

47
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
...pretend I'm telling you a storyand it's really funny.

48
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
So everyone just laugh. Now!

49
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
I know, I know!

50
00:02:52 --> 00:02:52
I'm Rob Donan.

51
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
Hi, Rob Donan.

52
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
I don't know anything about music,but I think you're really great.

53
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
Anyway, I schedule performersfor children's libraries.

54
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
And I was thinking, have you thoughtabout playing your songs for kids?

55
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
I would love to have kids...

56
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
...hear me play the songsthat I will write for them.

57
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
What do we do for dinner?

58
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
We could cook for ourselves.

59
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
It's Erika.

60
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
My God. The stalker!

61
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Never mind. It's open.

62
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
Hitting her with a frying panis a good idea.

63
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
But we want a backup plan,just in case she isn't a cartoon!

64
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
Let's get out of here!

65
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
The one time they're not home!

66
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
We'll leave.When we pass her...

67
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
...she won't know me,because we never met!

68
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
That's how radio starsescape stalkers!

69
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
She's coming!

70
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
It's me.

71
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
This is it.This is how we're gonna die.

72
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
You ready?

73
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
Wait, wait, wait!

74
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
Erika!

75
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
- Mr. Geller?- Yes, hi.

76
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

77
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
You had a question?

78
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
I can't find the monkey I donatedlast year. He's a capuchin...

79
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
...answers to the name Marcel?

80
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

81
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
Marcel has passed on.

82
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Oh, my God. What happened?

83
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
He got sick,and then he got sicker...

84
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
...and then he got a little better.

85
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
But then he died.

86
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
I can't believe this!

87
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.But you know, there's an old saying:

88
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
"Sometimes monkeys die."

89
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
It's not a great saying...

90
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
...but it certainly is fitting today.

91
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
- Someone should've called me.- I'm sorry.

92
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
Look, I know this can'tbring him back...

93
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
...but here, it's just a gesture.

94
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
Zoo dollars?

95
00:05:10 --> 00:05:15
Yes, and come see the bird showat 4. The macaws wear hats.

96
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
It's a lot cuterif your monkey hasn't just died.

97
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
I know.

98
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
I can't believe Joey's havinglunch with his stalker!

99
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
What is she like?

100
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
You remember Kathy Bates in "Misery"?

101
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
Well, she looksthe exact opposite of that.

102
00:05:35 --> 00:05:36
And she's not crazy?

103
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
Oh, no, no.She's a total whack-job.

104
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
She thinks that Joey isactually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

105
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
Oh, my God!

106
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
And he's going out with her?

107
00:05:45 --> 00:05:46
He cannot pursue this.

108
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
Just because this woman sees Joeythrough the magical bo x...

109
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
...in her living roomdoesn't mean she's not a person.

110
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
Does she not deserve happiness?Does she not deserve love?

111
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
Why are you looking at me? He'sthe one who wants to boff the maniac!

112
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
Are you okay?

113
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
No. I'm just nervous.

114
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
Maybe if I just picture them allin their underwear...

115
00:06:05 --> 00:06:10
That's not a good idea. That'sthe reason the last guy got fired.

116
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
I'm used to playing for grownups.

117
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
Grownups drink their coffeeand do their grownup thing.

118
00:06:17 --> 00:06:18
And kids...

119
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
...listen.

120
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
It's just a huge responsibility.

121
00:06:22 --> 00:06:23
What?

122
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
Are you gonna kiss me?

123
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
I was thinking about it.

124
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Alrighty! Let's play some tunes!

125
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
- Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.- Hi, Phoebe!

126
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
I'm gonna play some songsabout grandparents, okay?

127
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
Who everyone likes

128
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
And a bright shiny bike

129
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
Been coming to dinner

130
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
She looked so much thinner

131
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
She moved to Peru

132
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
And someday you will too

133
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
- Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?- Yeah, it is.

134
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
What?

135
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...

136
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
...and a while ago you werereattaching Simone's spinal cord.

137
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
That was a tricky one.

138
00:07:26 --> 00:07:26
In reality...

139
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
...that operation takes 10 hours.But they only showed it for 2 minutes.

140
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
Who's "they"?

141
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
No one.

142
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
Drake, you are so talented.Let me see those hands.

143
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
Oh, these hands,these beautiful hands.

144
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
I could just eat them.

145
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
But I won't.

146
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Otherwise my watch would fall off.

147
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
No, seriously.

148
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
These hands...

149
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
...these miracle, magical,life-giving hands.

150
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
Just to be near them, touch them,maybe even lick one?

151
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
All right. Just one.

152
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
You're good at that.

153
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
Oh, my God! Someone!He's choking!

154
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
Is anyone here a doctor?

155
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
Yes, the best doctor in Salem!

156
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
Dr. Drake Ramoray!

157
00:08:34 --> 00:08:39
Meet me in the nocturnalhouse in 15 minutes.

158
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
Hey, look. I don't really enjoybeing with other men that way.

159
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
But, zoo dollars?

160
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
It's about your monkey!

161
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
It's alive.

162
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
I don't understand.Why didn't you help that man?

163
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
Because I'm a neurosurgeon...

164
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
...and that was clearly a case of...

165
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
..."foodal chokage".

166
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
I gotta tell you something...

167
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
You don't have to tell me anything.

168
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
You don't have toexplain yourself to me.

169
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
Who am I to questionthe great Dr. Drake Ramoray?

170
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
I should be happy to be near you.

171
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
Hey, I...

172
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
Hey what?

173
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
That's it. Just hey!

174
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

175
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
There'll be times when you get older

176
00:09:36 --> 00:09:37
When you'll want to sleep with people

177
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
But don't!

178
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
'Cause...

179
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
... that's another thing...

180
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
... that you don't wanna doEverybody!

181
00:09:46 --> 00:09:51
That you don't wanna do

182
00:09:51 --> 00:09:52
- Excellent!- Very informative!

183
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
Not at all inappropriate!

184
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
Thank you for coming, everybody!There are cookies in the back.

185
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
That was great.

186
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
The kids loved you.

187
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
Yea! I rock!

188
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
And you know why?Because you told the truth.

189
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
Nobody ever tells kids the truth.

190
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
You were incredible!

191
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
But...?

192
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
- How'd you know there was a "but"?- I sense these things.

193
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
It was either "but" or "butter".

194
00:10:19 --> 00:10:20
The thing is, I thinksome of the parents...

195
00:10:21 --> 00:10:22
...they were hoping that...

196
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
...you'd play more songsabout barnyard animals.

197
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
I can do that.

198
00:10:26 --> 00:10:27
Really?

199
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
Because that would be fantastic!

200
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
What? You wanna kiss me?

201
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
I'm thinking about it.

202
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
The bat.

203
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
Ambassador of darkness.

204
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
Flitting out of his cavelike a winged messenger.

205
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
Sightless specter of the macabre.

206
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
Buddy, my monkey?

207
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
Oh, yeah, right.

208
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
There was a break-in...

209
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
...a few months back.Inside job.

210
00:10:54 --> 00:10:55
Your monkey was taken.

211
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
The zoo told methat my monkey was dead!

212
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
The zoo!

213
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
You believe everythingthe zoo tells you?

214
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
That's the only thingthe zoo's ever told me.

215
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
Of course they'll say that!They don't want the bad publicity.

216
00:11:09 --> 00:11:10
It's all a great big cover-up.

217
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
Do you have any ideahow high up this thing goes?

218
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
That guy Lipson?

219
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
Lipson knows?

220
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
Lipson knows, huh?

221
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
Hello, Mr. Possum.

222
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
Enigma of the trees,upside-down denizen of the night.

223
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
- Taunting gravity...- Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?

224
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
Word on the street...

225
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
When I say "street", I mean thosepretend streets here at the zoo.

226
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
Of course.

227
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
Your monkey found a new career...

228
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
...in the entertainment field.That's all I know.

229
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
This is unbelievable!

230
00:11:43 --> 00:11:48
So what is this informationworth to you, my friend?

231
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
Are you tryingto get me to bribe you?

232
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
Maybe.

233
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
But you already told me everything.

234
00:12:01 --> 00:12:01
Check it out.

235
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
He actually isthe Monkeyshine monkey!

236
00:12:05 --> 00:12:05
What'll you do?

237
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
I'm gonna call the beer companyand try to find him.

238
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
That's what I didwhen I lost my Clydesdales.

239
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
Okay, hi again!

240
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
Hi, Phoebe!

241
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
Today, we're gonna start withsome songs about barnyard animals.

242
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

243
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

244
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
And grinds him up

245
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
And that's how we get hamburgers

246
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
Now chickens!

247
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
Only you who can save her, Drake!

248
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
I'm not God!

249
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
There goes my whole belief system.

250
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
It's Erika.

251
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
Quick! Shut off the TV.

252
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
I wanna see what happens!

253
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
I get Leslie out of the comathen we make out.

254
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
How can that be?You were kissing Sabrina!

255
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
Rachel, it's a worldwhere Joey is a neurosurgeon.

256
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
Hey, Erika. Come in.

257
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
How did you get here so fast?I just saw you in Salem.

258
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
Right, they choppered me in.

259
00:13:02 --> 00:13:03
What's up?

260
00:13:04 --> 00:13:05
You're having a little party too!

261
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
- Is she here?- Who?

262
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
Sabrina. I know about you two!

263
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
I saw you today, kissingin the doctor's lounge.

264
00:13:13 --> 00:13:14
It's not what you think...

265
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
You told me I was the only one!

266
00:13:20 --> 00:13:21
All right, look.That's it.

267
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

268
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
I should have told youa long time ago...

269
00:13:25 --> 00:13:26
...but I am not Drake Ramoray.

270
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.I just pretend to be a doctor.

271
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
Oh, my God! Do the peopleat the hospital know?

272
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
Somebody wanna help me out here?

273
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
Oh, I know! I know!

274
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
Where am I?

275
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
University Hospital...

276
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
for the last 18 years.

277
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
How can you be here and there?

278
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
Because it's a TV show!

279
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
What are you getting at?

280
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
I'm not Drake!

281
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
That's right!He's not Drake. He's...

282
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!

283
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
Is this true?

284
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
Yes! Yes, it is true!

285
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
And I know this...

286
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
...because he pretendedto be Drake to sleep with me!

287
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
And then he told mehe would run away with me!

288
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
And he didn't!

289
00:14:21 --> 00:14:25
And you left the toilet seat up,you bastard!

290
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
Is all this true?

291
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

292
00:14:35 --> 00:14:36
You deserve much better than me.

293
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
You deserve to be with the real Drake.He's the one you fell in love with.

294
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
Go to Salem. Find him!

295
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
He's the guy for you!

296
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
Oh, Hans!

297
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
Hans?

298
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
Hans!

299
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
Yo, evil twin!

300
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
Right. Goodbye, Erika.

301
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
Good luck in Salem.

302
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
Take care.

303
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
I'll never forget you, Hans.

304
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
All right.The people who threw the water!

305
00:15:08 --> 00:15:08
Helping you out!

306
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
Fired?

307
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
Why?

308
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
The library board got a lotof complaints from parents...

309
00:15:14 --> 00:15:15
...about the stuff in your songs.

310
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
I can't believe it!

311
00:15:17 --> 00:15:22
Did you tell your board thatthe kids want to hear the truth?

312
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
I see.

313
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
Maybe if you just playedsome regular kiddy songs?

314
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
What do you want me to be?Like some...

315
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
...stupid, big,like, purple dinosaur?

316
00:15:35 --> 00:15:36
You don't have to be Barney.

317
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
Who's Barney?

318
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
I tracked down Marcel and get this.He's healthy, he's happy...

319
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.

320
00:15:48 --> 00:15:49
You're kidding!

321
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
- This is amazing!- I know.

322
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
I finally get a part on TV,and the monkey's making movies.

323
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
Rachel, I'm ready.

324
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
Excuse me. Is this where thesinging lady is, who tells the truth?

325
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
I guess that's me.

326
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
She's here!

327
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
Sometimes men love women

328
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
Sometimes men love men

329
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Then there are bisexuals

330
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
They're kidding themselves

331
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
This is exciting! I haven'tseen my monkey in a year.

332
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
What, you neverlook down in the shower?

333
00:16:36 --> 00:16:40
I'm not allowed to make one jokein the "monkey is penis" genre?

334
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Back up, please.

335
00:16:41 --> 00:16:42
Back up. Come on.

336
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
Excuse me.Where can we find the monkey?

337
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
I'm sorry.It's a closed set.

338
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
I'm sorry, you don't understand.I'm a friend of his.

339
00:16:49 --> 00:16:50
We used to live together.

340
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
And I have a timesharein the Poconos with Flipper.

341
00:16:56 --> 00:16:57
There he is!

342
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
Hey! Buddy!

343
00:16:58 --> 00:17:02
Marcel! Marcel!

344
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
In the jungle

345
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
The mighty jungle

346
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
The lion sleeps tonight

347
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
The mighty jungle

348
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
The lion sleeps tonight

349
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
They won't take you to the vet

350
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
Their favorite pet

351
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
Smelly cat

352
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
It's not your fault

353
00:17:56 --> 00:17:57
- What?- I'm sorry.

354
00:17:58 --> 00:17:59
What's wrong with that?

355
00:17:59 --> 00:18:03
I think you might want to picka more masculine note.
