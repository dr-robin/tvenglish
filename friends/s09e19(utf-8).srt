00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
God, you're beautiful.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
Why are we fighting this?

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
You know you want it to happenas much as I do.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
I want you. I need you.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
Let me make love to you.

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
I don't wanna stand in the wayof true love or anything...

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
...but I think a cantaloupemight hurt less.

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
No, I'm rehearsing my lines.

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
They're giving me a romantic storyon "Days of our Lives".

00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
It's the first time my character's gotone. I'm nervous. I want it to be good.

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
I haven't seen you this worked-up sinceyou did that dog-food commercial...

12
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
...and you thought you were gonna bewith a real talking dog.

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
Yeah, that was a disappointment.

14
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
You wanna come down to the setand tell me if I'm doing okay?

15
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
- Are you serious?- Yeah.

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
You just have to promise notto get thrown out again.

17
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
- That was an honest mistake.- Right.

18
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53
"Oh, my God. Is this the men's room?I feel so foolish.

19
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56

41
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28

42
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
Tell them I'm a chefat a big New York restaurant.

43

44
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38

46
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43

- Don't worry, use your travel insurance.- I don't have travel insurance.

48
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
Well, this is what happenswhen people live on the edge.

49
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
Why don't you take Ross?

50
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
Don't you think that'll be a little weird?I mean, two guys in a romantic inn?

51
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
- No, not if the room has two beds.- I guess.

52
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
It still seems a little..."Moonlight boat ride"?!

53
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
Joey, is this the bedwhere Olivia lost her virginity?

54
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
I don't know,but one of the extras sure did.

55
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
Listen, Rach. Thanks againfor coming down to watch my scenes.

56
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
Please, honey. Just the fact that youwant me here to support you, I'm...

57
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
Oh, my God. Is that Christian Saunders?He is so gorgeous!

58
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
And also, so gay.

59
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
Well, in my head,he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.

60
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
Well, at the Christmas party, himand Santa did some definitely-gay stuff.

61
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
Joey? Joey, we're ready for you.

62
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
Okay. All right, wish me luck.

63
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
Okay. Not that you need it, but good...God! Is that Chase Lassiter?

64
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
- He's straight, right?- Rach, if you weren't here wondering...

65
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
...if these guys were gay,I don't know if I could do this.

66
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry. Good luck.

67
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
On a bell, please. Quietly.

68
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
And action!

69
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
Drake, what are you doing here?

70
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
Stopping you from marryingthe wrong man...

71
00:03:54 --> 00:03:55
...and making the biggestmistake of your life.

72
00:03:56 --> 00:03:57
- Get out.- You don't love him.

73
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
What do you know about love?

74
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
I know what I felt that nightwhen we kissed under the bridge.

75
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
- That kiss never happened.- Well, what about this one?

76
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
Now, I told you to get out.

77
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
Fine, I'll go.

78
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
But let me ask you one question.

79
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
- You look real familiar. Have we...?- Shh! He's asking her a question.

80
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
Can you live the rest of your life neverknowing what we could have been?

81
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
- I don't have a choice.- Yes, you do.

82
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
Yes, you do. I'm the one who doesn'thave a choice because I...

83
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Because I can't stop loving you.

84
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
- Don't say that.- Tell me to stop.

85
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
Just...

86
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
...tell me to stop.

87
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
- Cut!- No!

88
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Or, cut. You know, that's your call.

89
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
- Everything was delicious.- Thank you.

90
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
It was. The duck in particularwas superb.

91
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
Thank you.

92
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
You haven't said anything.

93
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
Actually, I do have one small complaint.

94
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
Well, please, I welcome criticism.

95
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
The musician right outside the restaurantis kind of a mood killer.

96
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
What musician?

97
00:05:20 --> 00:05:21
What are you doing here?

98
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
You said you had customers lined upin the street, so I'm here to entertain.

99
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
- Great.- Yeah, it really has been great too.

100
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
They must have seen meplay before...

101
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
...because they requesteda bunch of my songs.

102
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
Yeah, "You Suck"...

103
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
...and "Shut Up and Go Home."

104
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
Listen, Phoebe. You know how muchI love listening to your music...

105
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
...but...- But what?

106
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
This is kind of a classy place.

107
00:05:46 --> 00:05:47
Okay, say no more.

108
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
Everyone!

109
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
Classy, huh?

110
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Hi, Chandler Bing. I have a reservation.

111
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
Welcome to the Chestnut Inn.Where are you joining us from?

112
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
- New York.- The Big Apple.

113
00:06:08 --> 00:06:12
He's wound up. We had to stop at everymaple-candy stand on the way here.

114
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
I ate all my gifts for everybody.

115
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
I'm sorry, there's no recordof your reservation in the computer.

116
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
- That's impossible. Check again, please.- Check again, please.

117
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
- I'm sorry, it's not here.- It's not there.

118
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
Let me get this straight. I calledto try to cancel my reservation...

119
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
...was told it's not refundable. Then wedrove six hours all the way up here...

120
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
...and now we don't have a reservation?- I don't know what to say.

121
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
She doesn't know what to say.

122
00:06:37 --> 00:06:38
Just give usthe cheapest room you have.

123
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
The only thing we have availableis our deluxe suite. The rate is $600.

124
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
- That's insane.- It's totally insane.

125
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
Let's drive home. We'll hit all themaple-candy stores on the way back...

126
00:06:47 --> 00:06:52
...and if they're closed, then maybe we'lltap a tree and make some ourselves.

127
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
Does that room have a closetI can lock him in?

128
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
- We'll take it.- Great.

129
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
- They are totally ripping us off!- Dude, don't worry about it.

130
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
I know how to make your money back.This is a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities.

131
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
We just load up on those. Like thoseapples. Instead of taking one...

132
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
...I take six.

133
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
Great. At $ 100 an apple, we're there.

134
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
Come on, you get the idea. You know,we'll make our money back in no time.

135
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
- Dude, you're shaking.- It's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?

136
00:07:25 --> 00:07:26
- Hi.- Hey.

137
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
Joey, I got to tell you, I have beenthinking all day about that scene you did.

138
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
You were amazing.

139
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
You know, the writing was good.And the director's good.

140
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
And my costar's good.

141
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
But they're not as good as me!

142
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
You have to tell mewhat happens tomorrow.

143
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
I'm going over the script now.Wanna read lines with me?

144
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
Me? Oh, I'm not an actress.

145
00:07:47 --> 00:07:50
- All right, I can ask Monica.- Screw her! That part is mine!

146
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
Okay, so just from the topof the page right here.

147
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
Okay.

148
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
Hello, Drake.I'm surprised to see you here.

149
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
- I can't believe you married him.- Well, what choice did I have?

150
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.

151
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
So, what about us?Everything we feel for each other?

152
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
It's over. You have to accept that.

153
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
How can I, knowing I'll neverhold you in my arms again...

154
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
...or touch your skin or feel your lips...

155
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
...knowing I'll never make love to you?

156
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
How can I acceptthat I can never kiss you again...

157
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
...when it's all I can do notto kiss you right now?

158
00:08:29 --> 00:08:30
Kiss me.

159
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
What?

160
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
Kiss me.

161
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
- Rach, it doesn't say that.- No, I'm saying it.

162
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
- But...- Just don't talk.

163
00:08:47 --> 00:08:48
Well, that's new.

164
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.

165
00:08:59 --> 00:09:00
I've forgotten a couple of things.

166
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
Could you have some complimentarytoiletries sent up to my room?

167
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
Thank you.Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...

168
00:09:07 --> 00:09:12
...razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,Band-Aids, shaving cream, after shave.

169
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
And I feel like I'm forgetting something.

170
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
Is there anything else you havethat I haven't asked for already?

171
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
Yeah, go ahead,send up some tampons.

172
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
- USA Today.

173
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
Nice. Put it with the others.

174
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
And I also got two more apples.

175
00:09:29 --> 00:09:30
We're four short of a bushel!

176
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
God, I feel so alive.I love being in the country!

177
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
Also, got these greatsalt and pepper shakers...

178
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
...from the restaurant.- That's not cool.

179
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
Dude, none of this is cool.

180
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
Look, Chandler, you have to findthe line between stealing...

181
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
...and taking what the hotel owes you.

182
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
For example: A hair dryer, no, no, no.

183
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
But shampoos and conditioners,yes, yes, yes.

184
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
Now, the salt shaker is off limits.

185
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
But, the salt...

186
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
I wish I'd thought this through.

187
00:10:01 --> 00:10:05
I think I get what you mean, though.Like, the lamp is the hotel's...

188
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
...but the bulbs...Oh, you already got that.

189
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.

190
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
- Okay, how about this?- No, no, no.

191
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
- You can't take the remote control.- Yes, but the batteries.

192
00:10:20 --> 00:10:21
Thank you. Thank you very much.

193
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
- Let's celebrate with some maple candy.- No!

194
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
At least tell me where you hid it.

195
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
- Can I ask you a question?- Yeah.

196
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
Have you ever had any...

197
00:10:36 --> 00:10:40
...weird, romantic dreams?

198
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
Let me think.

199
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
When I was younger, I used to dreamthat I got married to Mayor McCheese.

200
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
And on our wedding night,I ate his head.

201
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Okay.

202
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
Well, this is like that...

203
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
...in no way.

204
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
I had a dream last nightthat I wanted to kiss Joey.

205
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
Wow! You mean like"kiss him" kiss him?

206
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
Oh, yeah.I mean, it was pretty intense.

207
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
- What brought that on?- I don't know.

208
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
Maybe it had to do with the factI saw him do a love scene.

209
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
- A love scene? With who?- Olivia.

210
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
Olivia?!I thought she was marrying Connor?!

211
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
Oh, right. Real life more important.

212
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
- You think my dream means anything?- I don't know.

213
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
I mean, you saw him do a love scene.Maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.

214
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
Maybe you have a thing for Drake.

215
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
Well, it was Joey readingDrake's lines in the dream.

216
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
Of course it was. Trust me,when it comes to psychology...

217
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
...I know what I'm talking about.

218
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
- I took two psych classes in college.- You took the same class twice.

219
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
- It was hard!- I know.

220
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
- Hey.- Hi.

221
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
Here, Monica, look what I got to wearwhen I play at your restaurant.

222
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
Wait.

223
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
Right? I think this might even class up"The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man."

224
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
Phoebe...

225
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
...maybe I wasn't clear before.

226
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
I really love listeningto your music here.

227
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
But my restaurant,it's sort of an upscale place.

228
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
Right, yeah, okay. I'll ask the butlerto fetch my diamonds out of the vault.

229
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
Phoebe, it's not what you wear.

230
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
It's sort of your songs.

231
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
I just don't think you should playat the restaurant anymore.

232
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
Okay. Fine, I'll just...

233
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
I'll take the hat back.

234
00:12:31 --> 00:12:32
There.

235
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
Hey, so you guys, the funniestthing happened at work the...

236
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
My songs aren't good enoughfor your restaurant?

237
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
Okay, we're still on that.

238
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
- I didn't say they weren't good enough.- Then what's wrong with them?

239
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
What, they don't go with yourtiny portions of pretentious food?

240
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
- Tiny portions?- Yeah, well, "Excuse me.

241
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,but I can't see it. I can't see it."

242
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
- Phoebe, it's not about quantity.- Well, it's not about quality.

243
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Oh, really?You wanna talk about quality?

244
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
Have you ever heard of a "key"?It's what some people sing in.

245
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
Well, at least all my songsdon't taste like garlic.

246
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
Yeah, there are otheringredients, Monica.

247
00:13:13 --> 00:13:14
So that's what we're doing.

248
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
When I'm in a coffeehouse boppingalong to one of your songs...

249
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
...I'm wearing earplugs.- Earplugs or cloves of garlic?

250
00:13:22 --> 00:13:23
You know what?I take back what I said before.

251
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
Keep playing at the restaurant, becausewith your music driving people inside...

252
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
...my bar saleshave gone up like crazy.

253
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
What are people having,the garlic martini?

254
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
Here's your bill.We hope you enjoyed your stay.

255
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
Oh, we did.And you still have all your lamps.

256
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
- I didn't factor in the room tax.- Dude, don't worry about it.

257
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
I found an unattended maid's cart.We're way ahead of the game.

258
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
- Oh, my God.- What?

259
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
There's something new in the bowl.

260
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
- Look, we have enough. Just walk away.- No, but I want the pine cones.

261
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
- There's a forest right outside.- It's not the same.

262
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
Okay, go quick.

263
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
Thank you for a delightful stay.

264
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
My maple candy!

265
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
It's just you. I thought someone wasswinging a bag of cats against the wall.

266
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
You'd better get back in that kitchen.The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.

267
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
- Okay, you have to stop playing now.- Why?

268
00:14:37 --> 00:14:38
The only person my playingis bothering is you.

269
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
- Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.- Get your garlic peelers off me.

270
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
Excuse me? Excuse me?

271
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
Hi, I'm Monica Geller.I'm the head chef here.

272
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
Okay, I was actually expectinga little applause there, but whatever.

273
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
Quick question.By a show of hands...

274
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
...how many of you were botheredby this woman's singing outside?

275
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
Okay, okay. How many of youenjoyed the music outside?

276
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
Let me ask you this question.How many thought the music was fine...

277
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
...but not in keeping with the toneof the restaurant?

278
00:15:09 --> 00:15:13
Who identified this restaurant's toneas "pretentious-comma-garlicky"?

279
00:15:13 --> 00:15:18
Okay, who thinks the food is deliciousand a little pretension never hurt anyone?

280
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
Okay, well, all right, who thinksthe food is fine, the music was fine...

281
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
...but your evening was ruinedby this incessant poll-taking?

282
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
Excuse us.

283
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
All right, here's a question.

284
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
Who was so worried abouther restaurant being fancy...

285
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
...that she made a big deal abouther friend playing her music...

286
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
...and feels really bad about it now?

287
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
Well, who was so stupidand stubborn...

288
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
...that she lashed outagainst her friend's cooking...

289
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
...which she actually thinksis pretty great?

290
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
- I'm sorry.- I'm sorry too.

291
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
Hey, you wanna stick aroundand I'll whip you up some dinner?

292
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
Yeah, as long as it's free.The food here is ridiculously overpr...

293
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
Who hopes the hand-raising thing is stillcute enough that you won't hate me?

294
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
Joey, do you have peanut butteron the back of your head?

295
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
Oh, man. I thought I got it all.

296
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
How...?

297
00:16:20 --> 00:16:21
How?

298
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
I was making a peanut buttersmoothie, right?

299
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
I couldn't find this little plastic thingythat goes in the top of the blender.

300
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
And I thought, "Well, you know,how important can that be?" Right?

301
00:16:31 --> 00:16:32
Turns out, very.

302
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
Wow, definitely just Drake.

303
00:16:36 --> 00:16:37
- What?- How's it going with Drake?

304
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
- I don't think it's going very well.- What?

305
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
That scene I saw was so good.

306
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
Well, I'm feeling really insecureabout the one we're shooting tomorrow.

307
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
Is this that thing you do when you sayyou're bad so I'll give you a compliment?

308
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
A little.

309
00:16:51 --> 00:16:56
No, I really am worried. I have to make itconvincing that I'm in love with Olivia.

310
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
- So?- So I've never played that.

311
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
Oh, honey, it can't be that hard.I mean, you've been in love before.

312
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
Well, just once...

313
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
...with you.

314
00:17:09 --> 00:17:10
Okay. Well, this could bea little awkward.

315
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
I'm just gonna blow past it.

316
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
Well, look, can't you just usethat method-actor thing...

317
00:17:15 --> 00:17:19
...where you use your real-life memoriesto help you in your performance?

318
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
What the hell are you talking about?

319
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
All right, look, just try to rememberhow you felt when you were in love...

320
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
...and think about thatwhen you're playing the scene.

321
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
Okay. Yeah, I think I can do that.

322
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
Yeah. Okay, there's thisparty scene coming up.

323
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
And Olivia and her husband are there...

324
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
...and all Drake wants to do isgrab her and kiss her, but he can't.

325
00:17:44 --> 00:17:48
That makes me think about those timesI wanted to grab you and kiss you...

326
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
...but you didn't know, so I wouldjust pretend everything was cool...

327
00:17:51 --> 00:17:52
...but really it was killing me.

328
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
Joey, you nevertalked about that before.

329
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
Hey, you know what else I could use?

330
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
There's this scene where Drakesneaks into Olivia's bedroom...

331
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
...and she doesn't know he's there,which never happened with us.

332
00:18:09 --> 00:18:13
I mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,but he just wants to look at her.

333
00:18:14 --> 00:18:15
You know?

334
00:18:15 --> 00:18:19
And I remember all those morningsbefore you even put on your makeup...

335
00:18:19 --> 00:18:23
...when I would think to myself,"My God, she is beautiful."

336
00:18:25 --> 00:18:29
And it hurt so much because I knewI could never tell you.

337
00:18:31 --> 00:18:35
But it was worth it just to be therelooking at you.

338
00:18:40 --> 00:18:41
Thanks, dude. This is great!

339
00:18:50 --> 00:18:51
I got you something from Vermont.

340
00:18:52 --> 00:18:53
Besides tampons and salt?

341
00:18:55 --> 00:18:56
Oh, my God.

342
00:18:56 --> 00:18:59
Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.

343
00:19:00 --> 00:19:01
That's weird, it's empty.

344
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
Hi, you guys. What's going on?You guys wanna hang out or...?

345
00:19:11 --> 00:19:12
Do you guys hear a buzzing?

00:19:18 --> 00:19:19
