25

00:01:10.25,00:01:13.32

26

Hey, look at me![br]I' m making jam!

27



28

00:01:13.57,00:01:17.53

29

-I've been at it since 4 a.m.[br]-Where'd you get fruit at 4 a.m.?

30



31

00:01:17.73,00:01:20.53

32

Down at the docks.[br]You know, you can get it wholesale.

33



34

00:01:21.25,00:01:22.97

35

I didn't know there were docks.

36



37

00:01:26.73,00:01:27.92

38

Is it broken?

39



40

00:01:28.13,00:01:30.48

41

No, but I gotta wear this[br]for a couple weeks.

42



43

00:01:30.85,00:01:33.68

44

You tell the doctor you did it[br]jumping on your bed?

45



46

00:01:34.49,00:01:37.64

47

No. I had a whole story[br]worked out, but then. . .

48



49

00:01:37.89,00:01:39.21

50

. . .Chandler sold me out.

51



52

00:01:39.41,00:01:43.32

53

I didn't think the doctor would buy[br]that it "fell out of the socket. "

54



55

00:01:45.69,00:01:47.84

56

What is this? Fruit?

57



58

00:01:51.01,00:01:52.16

59

Monica's making jam.

60



61

00:01:52.77,00:01:57.00

62

Jam? I love jam! How come[br]we never have jam at our place?

63



64

00:01:57.25,00:01:59.24

65

Because the kids need new shoes.

66



67

00:02:00.57,00:02:04.24

68

I' m going into business. I' m sick of[br]being depressed about Richard.

69



70

00:02:04.45,00:02:07.01

71

I needed a plan.[br]A plan to get over my man.

72



73

00:02:07.21,00:02:10.12

74

What's the opposite of man? Jam!

75



76

00:02:12.17,00:02:14.20

77

Joey, don't! It's way too hot!

78



79

00:02:20.97,00:02:22.88

80

This'll just be my batch.

81



82

00:02:40.33,00:02:41.12

83

That's it.

84



85

00:02:41.33,00:02:42.76

86

Hey, you, J . Crew guy. . . .

87



88

00:02:42.97,00:02:44.69

89

Why are you following me?

90



91

00:02:44.89,00:02:47.08

92

All week, everywhere I look,[br]there's you.

93



94

00:02:47.57,00:02:50.69

95

You wouldn't return my calls.[br]You sent back my letters.

96



97

00:02:50.93,00:02:53.04

98

One more chance, Ursula. Please.

99



100

00:02:56.57,00:02:57.64

101

This is awkward.

102



103

00:02:59.53,00:03:03.16

104

Yeah, because you want Ursula,[br]and I' m Phoebe. Twin sisters.

105



106

00:03:04.57,00:03:05.92

107

Seriously.

108



109

00:03:07.37,00:03:09.60

110

That's great.[br]I' m stalking the wrong woman.

111



112

00:03:09.89,00:03:11.96

113

I am such a dingus!

114



115

00:03:12.49,00:03:14.32

116

Oh, you' re not a dingus.

117



118

00:03:14.57,00:03:18.00

119

I just want you to know[br]I wasn't always like this.

120



121

00:03:18.33,00:03:22.56

122

Before I met your sister, I was a[br]normal guy who sold cellular phones.

123



124

00:03:24.49,00:03:27.00

125

Look, it's not your fault.

126



127

00:03:27.21,00:03:30.68

128

I mean, this is just[br]what she does to guys, okay?

129



130

00:03:32.45,00:03:33.60

131

Well, thanks.

132



133

00:03:34.01,00:03:36.28

134

Wait. I got a little story.

135



136

00:03:37.01,00:03:40.28

137

Once, in junior high school,[br]I thought I was a witch.

138



139

00:03:40.97,00:03:45.01

140

And a guidance counselor told me[br]something that might help you.

141



142

00:03:45.41,00:03:48.96

143

He said, "Okay, you' re not a witch.[br]You' re just an average student. "

144



145

00:03:50.33,00:03:52.72

146

-See what I' m saying?[br]-Not really.

147



148

00:03:54.21,00:03:55.56

149

Well, get over it.

150



151

00:03:58.33,00:04:01.48

152

You seem like a really nice guy.

153



154

00:04:02.89,00:04:04.96

155

Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?

156



157

00:04:05.17,00:04:09.16

158

You' re right. I know you' re right.[br]And thanks for being so nice.

159



160

00:04:11.89,00:04:13.37

161

Thanks a lot.

162



163

00:04:14.05,00:04:15.45

164

Want to get some coffee?

165



166

00:04:20.29,00:04:22.72

167

You don't have to[br]walk behind me anymore.

168



169

00:04:28.17,00:04:31.44

170

"Gone for more jars. Be back later.[br]Monica Geller. "

171



172

00:04:32.93,00:04:34.81

173

Wait a minute. Look!

174



175

00:04:36.57,00:04:38.72

176

It's an empty apartment.

177



178

00:04:38.97,00:04:41.96

179

We' re all alone[br]in an empty apartment.

180



181

00:04:42.97,00:04:45.32

182

I have to be at work[br]in 1 0 minutes.

183



184

00:04:46.13,00:04:50.12

185

All right. It's not like[br]I' m employee of the year or anything.

186



187

00:04:55.17,00:04:56.24

188

There it is!

189



190

00:04:56.49,00:04:58.37

191

Oh, that's what you mean.

192



193

00:05:01.29,00:05:02.32

194

Do I look fat?

195



196

00:05:03.05,00:05:04.24

197

No.

198



199

00:05:05.41,00:05:06.44

200

I accept that.

201



202

00:05:06.65,00:05:11.09

203

When Janice asked me and I said no,[br]she thought I was calling her a cow.

204



205

00:05:12.01,00:05:14.84

206

Walk us through it, honey.[br]Walk us through it.

207



208

00:05:15.33,00:05:20.24

209

Janice said, "Hi. Do I look fat[br]today?" And I looked at her--

210



211

00:05:21.69,00:05:23.28

212

You looked at her?

213



214

00:05:25.97,00:05:27.24

215

You never look.

216



217

00:05:28.29,00:05:32.33

218

You just answer. It's like a reflex.[br]"Do I look fat?" "No. "

219



220

00:05:35.09,00:05:37.52

221

"Is she prettier than I am?"[br]"No. "

222



223

00:05:38.61,00:05:39.88

224

"Does size matter?"

225



226

00:05:40.13,00:05:41.48

227

And it works both ways.

228



229

00:05:44.53,00:05:47.52

230

So you both just[br]know this stuff?

231



232

00:05:47.77,00:05:50.97

233

After 30 or 40 fights,[br]you kind of catch on.

234



235

00:05:52.41,00:05:54.16

236

Okay. For instance:

237



238

00:05:54.37,00:05:58.44

239

Janice is coming back from a trip.[br]She gives you two options.

240



241

00:05:58.65,00:06:01.77

242

Option one: She'll take a cab[br]home from the airport.

243



244

00:06:01.97,00:06:05.36

245

Option two: You can meet her[br]at baggage claim. What do you do?

246



247

00:06:05.61,00:06:06.60

248

Easy. Baggage claim.

249



250

00:06:06.85,00:06:08.60

251

Wrong! Now you' re single.

252



253

00:06:11.01,00:06:13.92

254

It's actually secret[br]option number three.

255



256

00:06:14.29,00:06:17.49

257

You meet her at the gate. That way[br]she knows you love her.

258



259

00:06:18.53,00:06:19.85

260

Okay, this is good.

261



262

00:06:20.05,00:06:23.48

263

All right, I have one.[br]Janice likes to cuddle. . .

264



265

00:06:23.69,00:06:26.04

266

. . .at night,[br]which I' m all for.

267



268

00:06:26.33,00:06:29.76

269

But when you want to go to sleep,[br]you want some space.

270



271

00:06:30.21,00:06:32.56

272

So how do I tell her that without. . .

273



274

00:06:32.85,00:06:35.92

275

. . .you know, accidentally[br]calling her fat or something?

276



277

00:06:36.33,00:06:40.48

278

Sorry, honey. We can't help you[br]there, because we' re cuddly sleepers.

279



280

00:06:41.89,00:06:43.45

281

I' m late for work.

282



283

00:06:43.65,00:06:47.04

284

-Are you guys coming down?[br]-Yeah. I' m right behind you.

285



286

00:06:47.25,00:06:49.05

287

Good luck, Chandler.

288



289

00:06:52.73,00:06:54.68

290

The sleeping thing.

291



292

00:06:55.81,00:06:58.24

293

very tricky business,[br]but solvable.

294



295

00:06:58.49,00:07:01.08

296

I thought you were "cuddly sleepers. "

297



298

00:07:03.33,00:07:05.84

299

No, not cuddly.[br]Not me. Just her.

300



301

00:07:06.09,00:07:08.08

302

I' m like you.[br]I need the room.

303



304

00:07:08.37,00:07:09.60

305

Okay, come here.

306



307

00:07:13.41,00:07:15.21

308

Okay. You' re in bed.

309



310

00:07:20.05,00:07:22.08

311

I'll use the cushion.

312



313

00:07:23.69,00:07:27.44

314

Okay. You' re in bed.[br]She's over on your side, cuddling.

315



316

00:07:27.69,00:07:30.60

317

Now, you wait for her to drift off. . .

318



319

00:07:31.01,00:07:32.96

320

. . .and then you hug her. . .

321



322

00:07:33.57,00:07:37.88

323

. . .and roll her over[br]to her side of the bed.

324



325

00:07:38.29,00:07:39.85

326

And then you. . .

327



328

00:07:41.17,00:07:43.12

329

. . .roll away.

330



331

00:07:44.89,00:07:46.56

332

Hug for her.

333



334

00:07:49.61,00:07:51.60

335

Roll for you.

336



337

00:07:53.21,00:07:54.72

338

The old "hug and roll. "

339



340

00:07:55.25,00:07:58.60

341

One question. You' re pretending[br]the pillow's a girl, right?

342



343

00:08:02.61,00:08:06.16

344

Remember when you were a kid, your[br]mom would send you to the movies. . .

345



346

00:08:06.37,00:08:08.88

347

. . .with a jar of jam[br]and a little spoon?

348



349

00:08:12.13,00:08:13.69

350

You' re so pretty.

351



352

00:08:20.53,00:08:24.28

353

You know that guy who's been[br]following me? I talked to him today.

354



355

00:08:24.53,00:08:27.00

356

You talked to him?[br]Are you crazy?

357



358

00:08:29.01,00:08:32.72

359

First, I' m not crazy.[br]And second, say it, don't spray it.

360



361

00:08:33.89,00:08:37.20

362

Anyway, his name is Malcolm,[br]and he wasn't following me.

363



364

00:08:37.41,00:08:40.08

365

I mean, he was,[br]but he thought I was Ursula.

366



367

00:08:42.57,00:08:45.77

368

That's why he couldn't just[br]come up and talk to me.

369



370

00:08:46.69,00:08:49.25

371

Because of the restraining order.

372



373

00:08:51.45,00:08:53.40

374

Not feeling better about Malcolm.

375



376

00:08:55.05,00:08:56.93

377

No, no, he's not a kook.

378



379

00:08:57.25,00:09:01.04

380

He's just this very passionate,[br]incredibly romantic guy. . .

381



382

00:09:01.33,00:09:04.05

383

. . .that just got[br]a teensy bit carried away.

384



385

00:09:04.33,00:09:06.97

386

We get along really well,[br]and he's so cute.

387



388

00:09:07.93,00:09:12.48

389

Oh, my God! You've got a crush[br]on your sister's stalker.

390



391

00:09:13.09,00:09:15.84

392

I' m going to help him get[br]"de-Ursula-ized. "

393



394

00:09:16.09,00:09:19.05

395

Like I did for Joey[br]after he went out with her.

396



397

00:09:19.25,00:09:20.44

398

I didn't stalk her.

399



400

00:09:21.53,00:09:24.00

401

I asked for the news,[br]not the weather.

402



403

00:09:28.17,00:09:31.37

404

Joey, this is for you.[br]It's blackberry currant.

405



406

00:09:37.97,00:09:39.53

407

Joe, I got to ask.

408



409

00:09:39.73,00:09:42.45

410

The girl from the xerox place,[br]buck naked. . .

411



412

00:09:43.45,00:09:45.52

413

. . .or a big tub of jam?

414



415

00:09:47.45,00:09:48.93

416

Put your hands together.

417



418

00:09:52.93,00:09:55.36

419

Take your time with that.[br]It's my last batch.

420



421

00:09:56.09,00:09:57.52

422

No more jam?

423



424

00:09:58.53,00:10:00.52

425

What happened to[br]your jam plan?

426



427

00:10:00.73,00:10:04.12

428

I figured out I'd need to charge[br]$ 1 7 a jar just to break even.

429



430

00:10:04.33,00:10:07.40

431

So I've got a new plan now.[br]Babies.

432



433

00:10:08.65,00:10:11.00

434

Well, you'll need[br]much bigger jars.

435



436

00:10:13.33,00:10:16.48

437

-What are you talking about?[br]-About me having a baby.

438



439

00:10:16.69,00:10:18.84

440

-Are you serious?[br]-Yeah.

441



442

00:10:19.09,00:10:22.21

443

The jam plan helped me[br]take control of my life.

444



445

00:10:22.41,00:10:25.21

446

So I thought, "What is[br]the most important thing to me?"

447



448

00:10:25.41,00:10:28.24

449

And that's when I came up[br]with the baby plan.

450



451

00:10:28.45,00:10:30.80

452

Aren't you forgetting something?

453



454

00:10:31.33,00:10:33.97

455

What is that guy's name?[br]Dad!

456



457

00:10:35.81,00:10:39.20

458

It took me 28 years to find a man[br]I wanted to spend my life with.

459



460

00:10:39.41,00:10:43.32

461

If I have to wait another 28 years,[br]I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

462



463

00:10:43.53,00:10:45.33

464

And that's just stupid.

465



466

00:10:46.69,00:10:48.49

467

That's what's stupid?

468



469

00:10:50.53,00:10:54.49

470

I don't need an actual man.[br]Just a few of his best swimmers.

471



472

00:10:56.05,00:10:59.12

473

And there are places[br]you can go to get that. . .stuff.

474



475

00:10:59.33,00:11:01.28

476

Down to the docks again?

477



478

00:11:11.05,00:11:13.48

479

Night-night, Bing-a-ling.

480



481

00:11:15.13,00:11:16.64

482

Night-night. . .

483



484

00:11:17.49,00:11:18.64

485

. . .Janice.

486



487

00:11:22.61,00:11:25.00

488

Look at all the room on her side!

489



490

00:11:25.21,00:11:27.20

491

A giant penguin[br]could fit over there.

492



493

00:11:29.33,00:11:30.60

494

That'd be weird, though.

495



496

00:11:32.41,00:11:33.73

497

Hug and roll time.

498



499

00:11:33.93,00:11:36.12

500

I'm hugging. I'm hugging.

501



502

00:11:36.37,00:11:38.64

503

You're rolling, and....

504



505

00:11:39.25,00:11:40.76

506

Yes! Freedom!

507



508

00:11:41.49,00:11:43.32

509

Except for this arm!

510



511

00:11:43.97,00:11:46.16

512

I'm stuck. Stuck arm.

513



514

00:11:47.73,00:11:50.93

515

Time for the old tablecloth trick.[br]One fluid motion.

516



517

00:11:51.13,00:11:52.77

518

Quick like a cat.

519



520

00:11:52.97,00:11:55.44

521

And one, two...

522



523

00:11:56.05,00:11:57.20

524

... three!

525



526

00:12:04.41,00:12:06.13

527

Here's my binoculars.

528



529

00:12:06.33,00:12:08.76

530

Oh, great.[br]You' re doing great.

531



532

00:12:09.05,00:12:11.00

533

Going strong. Keep going.

534



535

00:12:12.25,00:12:14.40

536

These are my night-vision goggles.

537



538

00:12:15.13,00:12:18.72

539

This is the book I pretend to read[br]when I' m watching her in the park.

540



541

00:12:19.61,00:12:22.96

542

And these are Madlibs.[br]They' re just for fun.

543



544

00:12:25.25,00:12:29.08

545

This is the log I kept,[br]recording her every movement.

546



547

00:12:29.77,00:12:31.36

548

Want to hear some of it?

549



550

00:12:31.57,00:12:33.24

551

Not even a little bit.

552



553

00:12:34.65,00:12:35.60

554

It's about you.

555



556

00:12:35.89,00:12:37.48

557

Okay then.

558



559

00:12:42.45,00:12:44.17

560

"I met Phoebe today.

561



562

00:12:44.69,00:12:47.65

563

She was really nice to me[br]even though I' m such a loser.

564



565

00:12:48.89,00:12:51.72

566

And when I was walking home,[br]I thought about her a lot.

567



568

00:12:51.97,00:12:54.88

569

It was weird, but kind of cool. "

570



571

00:12:55.97,00:12:56.96

572

Good.

573



574

00:12:58.37,00:13:00.25

575

So what were you thinking?

576



577

00:13:01.33,00:13:03.84

578

I was thinking what it'd be[br]like to kiss you.

579



580

00:13:04.05,00:13:05.37

581

-Really?[br]-No.

582



583

00:13:08.53,00:13:11.96

584

That's just something I said now[br]so that maybe I could kiss you.

585



586

00:13:12.45,00:13:13.64

587

Oh, okay.

588



589

00:13:19.89,00:13:22.45

590

No, it's all right.[br]I just had a jar of mustard.

591



592

00:13:23.97,00:13:28.80

593

Okay. Sperm donor number 0381 5,[br]come on down!

594



595

00:13:29.93,00:13:31.65

596

Okay, he's 6' 2", 1 70 pounds.

597



598

00:13:31.89,00:13:34.85

599

He describes himself[br]as a male Gina Davis.

600



601

00:13:35.09,00:13:36.97

602

You mean there's[br]more than one of us?

603



604

00:13:38.77,00:13:41.89

605

You can't do this, Mon.[br]If you do this, I'll--

606



607

00:13:42.13,00:13:44.64

608

-You'll what?[br]-I'll tell Mom.

609



610

00:13:45.65,00:13:49.20

611

I' m sorry, but he's right.[br]I love you, but you' re crazy.

612



613

00:13:49.53,00:13:51.96

614

Why? Why is this crazy?

615



616

00:13:52.37,00:13:54.80

617

-So this isn't the ideal way--[br]-Oh, it's not--

618



619

00:13:55.05,00:13:56.77

620

Lips moving. Still talking.

621



622

00:13:57.97,00:13:59.92

623

It may not be ideal, but. . .

624



625

00:14:00.17,00:14:01.89

626

. . .I' m so ready.

627



628

00:14:02.45,00:14:04.52

629

I see the way[br]Ben looks at you.

630



631

00:14:05.09,00:14:07.36

632

It makes me ache, you know?

633



634

00:14:07.85,00:14:09.68

635

Check it out! Jam crackers!

636



637

00:14:13.85,00:14:15.92

638

Okay. All right, how's this?

639



640

00:14:16.17,00:14:18.84

641

Twenty-seven, ltalian-American guy.

642



643

00:14:19.09,00:14:20.60

644

He's an actor.

645



646

00:14:20.89,00:14:22.48

647

Born in Queens.

648



649

00:14:22.73,00:14:25.80

650

Wow! Big family.[br]Seven sisters. . .

651



652

00:14:26.69,00:14:28.72

653

. . .and he's the only. . .boy.

654



655

00:14:32.89,00:14:36.32

656

Oh, my God! Under personal comments:[br]"New York Knicks rule. "

657



658

00:14:36.53,00:14:38.01

659

Yeah, the Knicks rule!

660



661

00:14:41.85,00:14:43.65

662

Joey, this is you!

663



664

00:14:44.25,00:14:45.48

665

Let me see.

666



667

00:14:47.85,00:14:48.92

668

Oh, right!

669



670

00:14:50.21,00:14:51.88

671

You went to a sperm bank?

672



673

00:14:52.09,00:14:54.76

674

Right after I did that[br]sex study at NYU.

675



676

00:14:54.97,00:14:56.61

677

Remember that sweater I gave you?

678



679

00:14:57.65,00:14:59.72

680

That's how you bought it?

681



682

00:15:00.73,00:15:03.64

683

No. That's what I was wearing[br]when I donated.

684



685

00:15:06.77,00:15:09.65

686

I' m surprised there's any[br]of my boys left.

687



688

00:15:10.37,00:15:14.16

689

It is pretty competitive. There's[br]an actual rocket scientist here.

690



691

00:15:14.37,00:15:18.20

692

Maybe I should have them put my[br]Days of our Lives gig on here.

693



694

00:15:18.73,00:15:20.37

695

Juice this up a little.

696



697

00:15:23.57,00:15:25.21

698

How's the maniac?

699



700

00:15:25.65,00:15:28.08

701

He's yummy.[br]We did a little kissing.

702



703

00:15:29.41,00:15:31.21

704

Phoebe, what are you doing?

705



706

00:15:31.45,00:15:35.60

707

No, no. He's not into that anymore.[br]He quit for me.

708



709

00:15:36.65,00:15:40.88

710

This guy has been obsessed with[br]your sister for God knows how long.

711



712

00:15:41.09,00:15:43.65

713

You don't just give that up.

714



715

00:15:44.09,00:15:47.13

716

He gave me his night-vision[br]goggles and everything.

717



718

00:15:48.05,00:15:51.84

719

You' re taking the word of a guy[br]who has night-vision goggles?

720



721

00:15:52.09,00:15:55.76

722

He's not still following her.[br]You think he's still following her?

723



724

00:15:55.97,00:15:58.88

725

Wake up and smell[br]the restraining order.

726



727

00:16:00.77,00:16:02.00

728

What should I do?

729



730

00:16:02.25,00:16:05.13

731

If you really like this guy,[br]you should just trust him.

732



733

00:16:05.37,00:16:06.85

734

Thank you, Monica.

735



736

00:16:07.37,00:16:09.20

737

Or you could follow him.

738



739

00:16:09.41,00:16:11.48

740

That's what I'd do.[br]Forget mine.

741



742

00:16:14.97,00:16:16.16

743

What happened?

744



745

00:16:16.41,00:16:18.64

746

Crazy Chandler spun me. . .

747



748

00:16:18.85,00:16:20.36

749

. . .off the bed.

750



751

00:16:20.69,00:16:23.28

752

Wow! Spinning![br]Sounds like fun.

753



754

00:16:25.37,00:16:26.72

755

I wish.

756



757

00:16:26.97,00:16:30.36

758

He was just trying[br]Ross' "hug and roll" thing.

759



760

00:16:33.93,00:16:35.20

761

Ross' what?

762



763

00:16:35.41,00:16:38.64

764

Where he hugs you[br]and then he rolls you away, and. . . .

765



766

00:16:42.09,00:16:45.24

767

Oh. . .my. . .God!

768



769

00:17:21.09,00:17:22.12

770

What are you doing?

771



772

00:17:22.53,00:17:25.49

773

Oh, I was just here looking[br]for my. . .my. . . .

774



775

00:17:25.81,00:17:27.92

776

Part of an old sandwich.[br]Here it is!

777



778

00:17:30.53,00:17:32.12

779

Were you following me?

780



781

00:17:32.81,00:17:34.08

782

Perhaps.

783



784

00:17:35.65,00:17:37.53

785

Yes. I' m sorry.

786



787

00:17:37.73,00:17:40.69

788

I was afraid you were still[br]hung up on my sister.

789



790

00:17:40.89,00:17:42.72

791

So you spied on me.

792



793

00:17:43.61,00:17:45.60

794

I can't believe[br]you don't trust me.

795



796

00:17:51.21,00:17:55.36

797

Well, what do you know?[br]There goes my identical twin sister!

798



799

00:17:55.65,00:17:58.12

800

Just walking along, looking like me.

801



802

00:17:59.53,00:18:03.28

803

Is this a freakish coincidence, or[br]did you know she takes this train?

804



805

00:18:03.81,00:18:05.56

806

I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

807



808

00:18:06.09,00:18:08.40

809

I tried to stop,[br]but I couldn't.

810



811

00:18:09.01,00:18:10.65

812

I' m so pathetic.

813



814

00:18:10.85,00:18:14.60

815

No, it's not your fault.[br]It's partly my fault.

816



817

00:18:14.97,00:18:17.32

818

I made you quit cold turkey.

819



820

00:18:18.89,00:18:22.40

821

Well, I can't date you anymore[br]because you' re, you know. . . .

822



823

00:18:22.61,00:18:23.76

824

Wow!

825



826

00:18:25.77,00:18:29.73

827

But I will definitely help you[br]get over my sister. Okay?

828



829

00:18:30.57,00:18:32.72

830

Stalk me for a while, huh?

831



832

00:18:34.81,00:18:36.88

833

I'll be like an Ursula patch.

834



835

00:18:38.13,00:18:39.16

836

I don't know.

837



838

00:18:39.45,00:18:41.56

839

Just. . . .[br]Look, I' m going!

840



841

00:18:42.33,00:18:43.08

842

Come on.

843



844

00:18:44.57,00:18:47.48

845

I' m on the pillar.[br]Which way will I go?

846



847

00:18:50.93,00:18:52.88

848

-Where you going?[br]-To the bank.

849



850

00:18:53.37,00:18:55.04

851

Sperm or regular?

852



853

00:18:56.45,00:18:57.88

854

Sperm.

855



856

00:18:58.13,00:18:59.40

857

You' re really doing it?

858



859

00:18:59.65,00:19:02.32

860

Oh, yeah. I picked a guy.[br]37 1 35.

861



862

00:19:02.97,00:19:04.16

863

Sounds nice.

864



865

00:19:04.41,00:19:07.08

866

He does. He's got[br]brown hair and green eyes.

867



868

00:19:07.29,00:19:08.69

869

No kidding?

870



871

00:19:10.09,00:19:11.92

872

I figured you'd have picked[br]a blond.

873



874

00:19:12.53,00:19:13.96

875

Really? Why?

876



877

00:19:14.57,00:19:19.32

878

I always pictured you with a tall,[br]smart, blond guy with a name like. . .

879



880

00:19:19.57,00:19:20.36

881

. . .Hoyt.

882



883

00:19:22.97,00:19:24.12

884

It's a name. Yeah.

885



886

00:19:25.81,00:19:29.64

887

I saw you in this great house[br]with a big pool.

888



889

00:19:30.57,00:19:32.08

890

Is he a swimmer?

891



892

00:19:33.01,00:19:34.44

893

He's got the body for it.

894



895

00:19:35.61,00:19:37.01

896

I like that.

897



898

00:19:40.01,00:19:40.60

899

What?

900



901

00:19:40.89,00:19:42.84

902

You have a sign that says:

903



904

00:19:43.05,00:19:46.04

905

"We don't swim in your toilet.[br]Don't pee in our pool. "

906



907

00:19:46.25,00:19:47.76

908

We don't have that sign.

909



910

00:19:48.01,00:19:49.49

911

You do![br]It was a gift from me.

912



913

00:19:51.93,00:19:53.81

914

And you have three great kids.

915



916

00:19:54.01,00:19:55.68

917

Two girls and a boy?

918



919

00:19:57.49,00:20:01.61

920

And they wear little water wings,[br]and they run around on the deck.

921



922

00:20:01.81,00:20:04.45

923

And Hoyt wraps a towel[br]around all three of them.

924



925

00:20:04.65,00:20:05.48

926

Sure.

927



928

00:20:11.69,00:20:14.52

929

But, you know,[br]this way sounds good too.

930



931

00:20:16.25,00:20:17.32

932

Yeah.

933



934

00:20:29.53,00:20:31.68

935

Wow! This guy's an astronaut?

936



937

00:20:33.25,00:20:35.24

938

That would have been cool. . .

939



940

00:20:35.97,00:20:37.48

941

. . .for a day.

942



943

00:20:44.81,00:20:46.24

944

I called the sperm bank.

945



946

00:20:46.49,00:20:49.45

947

They haven't sold a single unit[br]of Tribbiani.

948



949

00:20:49.89,00:20:51.53

950

Nobody wants my product.

951



952

00:20:53.45,00:20:55.28

953

I don't get it.

954



955

00:21:01.53,00:21:03.36

956

Maybe if they met me in person.

957



958

00:21:05.13,00:21:06.72

959

You got a thing on your. . . .

960



961

00:21:11.33,00:21:12.12

962

Get it?

963



964

00:21:13.29,00:21:14.40

965

Yeah.

966



967

00:21:16.53,00:21:17.68

968

Hello.

969



970

00:21:19.45,00:21:20.52

971

Hello.

972



973

00:21:28.65,00:21:30.92

974

Chan, can I talk to you[br]for a second?

975



976

00:21:31.13,00:21:32.48

977

Sure. What's up?

978



979

00:21:33.25,00:21:36.05

980

Just one additional[br]relationship thought.

981



982

00:21:36.25,00:21:38.56

983

Something you' re probably aware of.

984



985

00:21:39.17,00:21:40.68

986

Women talk.

987
