00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
- You ready to go?- Let me just finish this.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
Hey, Ross. Check this out.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Yeah, I can't do that.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
- What are you doing?- Have you seen this?

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
It's our new alumni websitefor college.

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
You can post messages for people,let everyone know what you're up to.

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
Oh, great. A faster way to tell peoplethat I'm unemployed and childless.

8
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
It's actually interesting to findout what people are doing.

9
00:00:26 --> 00:00:27
Remember Andrea Rich?

10
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
That tall girl that wouldn't sleepwith you?

11
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
Well, her Internet company went under,and she lost an ear in a boating accident.

12
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
Bet she'd sleep with you now.

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
No, I already e-mailed her.

14
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
Let me see what you wroteabout yourself.

15
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
"Doctor of paleontology, two kids."

16
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
Wait a second. You split with Carolbecause you had different interests?

17
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
I think you split with Carol becauseyou had one very similar interest.

18
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
I'm gonna finish this later, okay?Let me just grab my coat.

19
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
Okay!

20
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
What, did you think you learned howto do it in the last two minutes?

21
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
Maybe we finish this for him.

22
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.

23
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
She is now my girlfriend.

24
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
I don't care what society says,it's the best sex I've ever had.

25
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
- And send.- No, no... You can't do that to him.

26
00:01:26 --> 00:01:27
- All right, let's go.- Dude!

27
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
I think you made it clear you can't betrusted with the ball inside the house.

28
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
And send.

29
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41

32
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
Hey. How was basketball?

33
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
It was fun. Right up until Chandlergot a finger in the eye.

34
00:02:16 --> 00:02:17
Oh, no! Who did that?

35
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Chandler. Yeah.

36
00:02:20 --> 00:02:21
Hey!

37
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
- Rach?- Yeah?

38
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
What's Huggsy doingin the crib with Emma?

39
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
She was just crawling around and foundhim, so I just let her sleep with him.

40
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
- That's all right, isn't it?- Of course. Yeah.

41
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
It's a stuffed animal, you know?It's for kids. Not for adults.

42
00:02:37 --> 00:02:38
I know that.

43
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Joey, you're sure? I mean,I know how much you love him.

44
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?I do not love Huggsy.

45
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
I like him a normal amount.

46
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
All right.Well, Emma loves him.

47
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she?He's a wonderful person!

48
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
- Hi.- Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?

49
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
- You feeling better?- Breaking up sucks.

50
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
- Oh, I really miss Mike.- Oh, I'm so sorry.

51
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
I've tried everything to feel better.I even tried writing a song about it...

52
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
...but I can't think of anythingthat rhymes with:

53
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
Hey, Monica, I'm gonna needyour help getting through this.

54
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
You're saying you'renot gonna need my help?

55
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
No. When I get to the pointwhere I'm ready...

56
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
...to hear cruel, mocking jokesabout Mike, I'm gonna come to you.

57
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
Oh, good, because I've already thoughtof three. Four! I just thought of a fourth!

58
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Okay. I mean, I knowI did the right thing.

59
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
Mike never wantsto get married...

60
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
...and I shouldn't be in a relationshipthat has no future.

61
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
But pretty soon,I'm gonna miss him so much...

62
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
...I'm gonna want to see him again,and you have to stop me.

63
00:03:38 --> 00:03:39
Okay, you got it.

64
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
Unless...Am I being too crazy about this?

65
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
All right, so there's no future. But thatdoesn't mean we still can't have fun.

66
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
- You know what? Forget what I said.- Really?

67
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
- All right, if that's what you want.- That was a test, and you just failed.

68
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Damn it! Rookie mistake!

69
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
I have sex with dinosaurs?

70
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
I believe I read that somewhere.

71
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
Not only is it not funny,it's physically impossible! Okay?

72
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
Depending on the species, I'd haveto have a 6-foot-long... It's not funny!

73
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
I respectfully disagree.

74
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
I can't believe you put thaton my alumni page.

75
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
- Who cares? Nobody reads those.- You better hope not...

76
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
...because I just read whatyou put on your page.

77
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
- I don't have a page.- Oh, I respectfully disagree!

78
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
sleeping like an angel.

79
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
wrapped around you.

80
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.

81
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Step away from the crib!I have a weapon!

82
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
It's okay! It's okay, Rach!It's me! Put down the scrunchie.

83
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
- What are you doing?- Well, I heard Emma stirring...

84
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
...so I came in to make sureshe could reach Huggsy.

85
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
Oh, thanks. All right, well, now thatI'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

86
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

87
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
This isn't over!

88
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
Wait a second. Why wouldRoss tell everyone in your class...

89
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
...that you are "as gayas the day is long"?

90
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
Because I told everyonehe slept with dinosaurs.

91
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
Well, that's clearly a joke.This could easily be true.

92
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
Would you get that, please? People havebeen calling to congratulate me all day.

93
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
Hello?

94
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
No, he's not here.Yeah, this is his wife.

95
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
Yeah. Well, it cameas quite a shock to me too!

96
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
Well, I guess I should've known. He justkept making me watch "Moulin Rouge."

97
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
Hang up! Hang up!

98
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
And that was a great movie.

99
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
I'm so gonna get back at Ross.

100
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
Oh, yeah, this'll show him.Here we go.

101
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
- What are you doing?- Oh, you'll see, my friend!

102
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
I'm dead?

103
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
And so young.

104
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
Posting that I died?That really isn't funny.

105
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
Well, how you died was funny.

106
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?

107
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
It kills over one Americansevery year.

108
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
Unbelievable. My classmatesare gonna think I'm dead.

109
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
My professors. My parentsare gonna get phone calls!

110
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
You're messing withpeople's feelings here.

111
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
You wanna talk about people's feelings?You should have heard how hurt...

112
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
...Professor Stern was when I told himI wouldn't be able to go to Key West!

113
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
You've really crossed a line here.But that's okay.

114
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
Because I'm on my wayto buy some Photoshop software...

115
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
...and a stack of gay porn.

116
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
That's right. Your coming-outis about to get real graphic!

117
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
God, I wish Mike were here.

118
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
Okay, if Mike were here, whatwould the two of you be doing?

119
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
What are you, animals?It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

120
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him.There's no harm in that.

121
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
That's how it starts. "I don't needto eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing.

122
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
Why not just a little sliver?"Or, "Okay, just a slice or two."

123
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
The next thing you know,you're 210 pounds...

124
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
...and you get wedged in goingdown the tunnel slide!

125
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.

126
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
But look, if you talk to him,then you're gonna want to see him.

127
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
And if you see him, you're gonnawanna get back together.

128
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
And I know that's not what you want.

129
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
All right, so give me your phone.

130
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
Here.

131
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
- And now your cell.- Okay.

132
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
There you go.

133
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
- This is your cell phone?- Yes.

134
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
This is your current cell phone?

135
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
Yes. It reminds meof a simpler time.

136
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
Phoebe? Where's your purse?

137
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
- Hey! No!- No!

138
00:07:59 --> 00:08:00
- Give it to me!- You can't have it!

139
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
- Give it to me!- No!

140
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
- I'll go in there!- Oh, yeah.

141
00:08:05 --> 00:08:06
- Phoebe, come here!- No!

142
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
- Give it to me!- You're crazy!

143
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!

144
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
Hey, look who's here. It's Joey.And he brought home a friend.

145
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
Emma's right here. You promised not tobring girls home in the middle of the day!

146
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
No, no, no, it's not a girl. It's...

147
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
...a brand-new Huggsy!

148
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
Oh! Oh, that's so great!Now Emma has two Huggsies!

149
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
No, no. Oh, no.No, Emma has one Huggsy.

150
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
The new Huggsy.

151
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
The other Huggsy, I don't know,I guess I'll just take him back.

152
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
You know what? When I was a little girl,I had a little pink pony named Cotton.

153
00:08:43 --> 00:08:47
Oh, I loved her so much. I took hereverywhere. I would braid her tail...

154
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
Make the transfer!

155
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
Should I be concerned that a button felloff the old Huggsy and I can't find it?

156
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
No, don't worry about it.I swallowed that years ago. Hey!

157
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
Oh, what? I don't thinkshe likes the new Huggsy.

158
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
- But he's the same.- I think she wants the old one back.

159
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
- Yeah, but he's the same.- Joey, come on.

160
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
But he's the same!

161
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
You're not the same.

162
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
You know, it's a lotless surprising to do that...

163
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
...after I've buzzed youinto the building.

164
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
So, Phoebe, why are theremen's shoes by the door?

165
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Those are my shoes.

166
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
Well, when you get over this breakup,we need to go shopping.

167
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
Look, Monica, I really appreciateyou checking in on me.

168
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
- But I'm actually feeling a lot better.- You are?

169
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
Yeah, I just kind of wantto be alone right now.

170
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
- Who's that?- I ordered Chinese food.

171
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
What are the chances?!

172
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
One billion Chinese people,and they send Mike!

173
00:09:54 --> 00:09:55
- What are you doing here?- Phoebe called me.

174
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
- Phoebe!- I'm sorry. I broke down.

175
00:09:58 --> 00:09:59
I wanted to see him.

176
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
Damn it, Phoebe,how did you even call him?

177
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
There's a speakerphoneon the base unit.

178
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
Base unit. Think, Monica, think!

179
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
- Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she...- This doesn't concern you!

180
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
Sorry. I guess I was thrown offby the mention of my name.

181
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
Look, guys, you can't do this.

182
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
It's gonna make gettingover each other harder.

183
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
Not if nothing happens.Why can't we just hang out as friends?

184
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
Sure. If you're just gonna hang outas friends, then maybe I'll join you.

185
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
You know, I'm your friendand Mike's friend.

186
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
Sit down.

187
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
Make room for your friend.

188
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
- So how have you been?- I've been pretty good.

189
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
- You look really beautiful.- Thanks. You look good too.

190
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
No, no, no. This is dangerous territory.Keep it clean.

191
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
So how's the piano playing going?

192
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
Actually, I've been playing a lotof love songs lately.

193
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
- I've missed you.- I've missed you too.

194
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
You know, on the way over here,I saw this drunk guy throw up.

195
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
And then a pigeon ate it.

196
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
Hey. Ross.

197
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
Look, I just wanted to apologize.

198
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
Don't tell me you actually madethose gay pictures of me.

199
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
Check this out.

200
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
So that's what I'd look likeif I worked out.

201
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
And was being servicedby a policeman.

202
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
You're not gonna actuallysend these out, are you?

203
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
Actually, I don't need to, because yourlittle "Ross is dead" joke didn't work.

204
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
Okay? There were no responses.

205
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
Nobody posted anything, nobody calledmy parents, so the joke is on you.

206
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,nobody cares that I'm dead.

207
00:11:52 --> 00:11:53
Oh, my God.

208
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
- Nobody cares that I'm dead?- Oh, come on, you know that's not true.

209
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
What are you talking about?You get 60 responses...

210
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
...just for comingout of the closet.

211
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
I didn't get one response,and I'm dead!

212
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
Well, the gay community is a lot morevocal than the dead community.

213
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
I can't believe this. Not even my geologylab partner. And I carried that guy!

214
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
Look, let's think about this, okay?

215
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
You think people are gonna disturbyour family at this tragic time?

216
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
That people are gonna post condolenceson a website?

217
00:12:18 --> 00:12:19
This isn't about people not caring.

218
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
This is about people not havinga decent outlet for their grief.

219
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.- Right.

220
00:12:26 --> 00:12:30
I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorialservice, tons of people would come.

221
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
Exactly!

222
00:12:33 --> 00:12:35
Ross, what are you doing?

223
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
You're having a memorial servicefor yourself?

224
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
No, that would be stupid.You're having it for me.

225
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
- Ross, don't press send. Don't press...- No, too late. Too late. It's sent.

226
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
Sorry, so is that pictureof you and the policeman.

227
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.Have you seen Huggsy?

228
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
Original or crappy?

229
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
- Original.- No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.

230
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Then what's that big lumpunder your covers?

231
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
- It's Monica, okay?- That's not Monica!

232
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
All right, fine!It's original Huggsy!

233
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
I know Emma wants him,but he's mine and I need him.

234
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
She's being unreasonable.

235
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
Joey, there is a reason that Emmaloves that stupid penguin so much!

236
00:13:13 --> 00:13:14
Oh, don't cover its ears!

237
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
It's because it reminds herof her Uncle Joey.

238
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
- It does?- Yeah.

239
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
And she's comforted by him becauseshe loves her Uncle Joey so much.

240
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
- Really? She loves me?- Oh, yeah.

241
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
But you know what?If you need Huggsy, don't worry.

242
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
Emma will totally understand.I won't, but whatever.

243
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
Okay, wait a minute, Rach.I mean, if...

244
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
If Huggsy means that muchto Emma, then...

245
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
Well, she can have him.

246
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joeywould step up.

247
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
- Look, Emma. Look who's back.- No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!

248
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
Are you...? You're gonna takeHuggsy away from a little child?

249
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
How do you think I got himin the first place?

250
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
All right, you two.I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

251
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
I don't want anything goingon while I'm gone.

252
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
Here's a few things you can discuss:

253
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
Mucus, fungus, and the ideaof me and Ross doing it.

254
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
I've missed you so much.

255
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
I won't ask you to get back together.I know we want different things, but...

256
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
- Just to be with you one more night.- I want that too.

257
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
- But is that gonna make it too hard?- It can't be any harder than this.

258
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
I mean, if I had known the last timeI saw you would be the last time, l...

259
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
I would have stopped to memorizeyour face, the way you moved.

260
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
Everything about you.

261
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
If I had known the last time I kissedyou would be the last time...

262
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
...I never would have stopped.

263
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
Kiss him, you fool!

264
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
- What?- Didn't you hear that speech?

265
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
If you don't kiss him,then I will.

266
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
I missed you so much.

267
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
- I knew you'd be here!- Crap.

268
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
- Who is this?- My friend Manny.

269
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
I asked him to keep meaway from you.

270
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
- Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.- Well, you're not doing a very good job.

271
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
- Excuse me?- What's with the kissing?

272
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
Hey, at least I knewwhere my guy was.

273
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
Yeah, thank God you were hereto oversee all the kissing.

274
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
- You didn't hear the speech.- I've heard the speech.

275
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
If he knew it was gonnabe the last time...

276
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
Hey, it was very moving.You're just heartless!

277
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
- You're weak!- You're weird!

278
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
Your pants are undone.

279
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
Where'd they go?

280
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
- Damn it.- Well, we blew it.

281
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
I blame myself.

282
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
And I blame you too.

283
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
It's been an hour, and not oneof my classmates has shown up?

284
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
I tell you, when I actually die, somepeople are gonna get seriously haunted.

285
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
There you go. Someone came.

286
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.

287
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
This is so exciting.My first mourner!

288
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
Hi. Glad you could come.

289
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
- Please come in.- Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?

290
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
- I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.- Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.

291
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
Thanks. I'm so sorryabout Ross, it's...

292
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
No, at least he died doingwhat he loved.

293
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
Watching blimps.

294
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
- Who is it?- You know some guy, Tom Gordon?

295
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
I don't remember him.

296
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
But then again,I touched so many lives.

297
00:16:12 --> 00:16:13
So did you know Ross well?

298
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
Actually, I barely knew him.I came because I heard Chandler's news.

299
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
Do you know if he's seeing anyone?

300
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
- Yes, he is. Me.- What? You mean...?

301
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
Can I ask you a personal question?How do you shave your beard so close?

302
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
Okay, Tommy!That's enough mourning for you.

303
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.

304
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
- Hey, listen. Call me.- Okay.

305
00:16:41 --> 00:16:45
- I'm dead and no one cares?- I look like a man?

306
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
Please, one ridiculous problemat a time.

307
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
This isn't ridiculous.Look around, no one's here.

308
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
You gave them one day's notice. Noteveryone checks the website every day.

309
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
And Monica, it's probablythe way you stand!

310
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
I guess you're right.Still, somebody must have seen it.

311
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
I went to that school for four yearsand I didn't have an impact on anyone?

312
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
Well, that's not true.You had an impact on me.

313
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
I mean, it's 15 years laterand we're still best friends.

314
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
Doesn't that count for something?

315
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
Oh, great, more party boysfor Chandler.

316
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
I'm sure it's somebody for you.Now go hide.

317
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller'smemorial service.

318
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
- Kori? Kori Weston?- Yeah.

319
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
- You look amazing.- And you are?

320
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
Chandler. Chandler Bing.And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.

321
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
You are married, though.

322
00:17:36 --> 00:17:39
Don't listen to him.He's in a really bad mood.

323
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
I can't believe that Ross is gone.It is just so sad.

324
00:17:45 --> 00:17:46
I didn't know Ross and youwere so close.

325
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
Oh, we weren't. But we had one classtogether. He was such a great guy.

326
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
And he talked so passionatelyabout science.

327
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
- I always remembered him.- I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.

328
00:17:56 --> 00:17:57
And if heaven has a door...

329
00:17:57 --> 00:18:00
...I'm sure he's pressing his earup against it and listening intently.

330
00:18:02 --> 00:18:05
I thought so many times aboutcalling him and asking him out.

331
00:18:05 --> 00:18:06
I guess I really missed my chance.

332
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
No, you didn't!

333
00:18:10 --> 00:18:12
I'm still alive!

334
00:18:13 --> 00:18:15
Kori, I know thisis a big surprise for you.

335
00:18:15 --> 00:18:18
It's a long story. But the things youjust said really made my day.

336
00:18:18 --> 00:18:20
The fact that you're heremeans more to me...

337
00:18:20 --> 00:18:22
...than if this room were filledwith people.

338
00:18:23 --> 00:18:25
You sick freak! Who does that?

339
00:18:25 --> 00:18:27
I can't believe I had a crush on you.

340
00:18:30 --> 00:18:32
Did you hear that?

341
00:18:32 --> 00:18:35
Kori Weston had a crush on me!

342
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
No, Mom, I am not dead.

343
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
I know it's not somethingto kid about.

344
00:18:47 --> 00:18:51
It was just a practical joke betweenChandler and me, but it's over, okay?

345
00:18:51 --> 00:18:55
Actually, no. Even if I had died,you would not be left childless.

346
00:18:56 --> 00:18:58
Monica?

347
00:19:02 --> 00:19:03
