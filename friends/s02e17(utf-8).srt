So what do you think?

5
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
- I decorated it myself.- Get out!

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
Wow, Joey, this is...

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
- Art.- Art it is.

8
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
Check this out!Is it a coffee table?

9
00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
Is it a panther?There's no need to decide.

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
Hey, nice pillow.

11
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
So tell me,is this genuine Muppet skin?

13
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Thanks. I love this.But you know what?

14
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
It makes me want to pee.

15
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
Yeah, me too.I think that's the challenge.

16
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
How come Chandler didn't come?

17
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
It's because he hada thing with the...

18
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
...with the thing.

19
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
Right. I got it.

20
00:00:51 --> 00:00:54
So why don't you show usthe rest of your "casa"?

21
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
The best part! Come on.

22
00:01:03 --> 00:01:04
Nice toilet.

23
00:01:05 --> 00:01:06
No, no, no. Behind it.

24
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
- You have a phone in here?- That's right.

25
00:01:08 --> 00:01:09
I have a phone.

26
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
In here.

27
00:01:12 --> 00:01:13
Joey, promise me something.

28
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
Never call me from that phone.

31
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
Okay, here we go.

32
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.Someone just got the last piece.

33
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
Oh, my God!You won't believe this!

34
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
I have just been discovered.

35
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
Wait a minute. I claimed youin the name of France four years ago.

36
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
Anyway.

37
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
Don't freak out and say howgreat this is until I'm done.

38
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
I just met this producerof this teeny record company...

39
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
...who said that I havea very fresh, offbeat sound...

40
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
...and she wants to doa demo of "Smelly Cat".

41
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
Okay, I told you not to do that yet.

42
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
And she wants to do a video.

43
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
I'm not done yet, okay?

44
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
God!

45
00:02:47 --> 00:02:52
If that goes well,they may even want to make an album.

46
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
I'm done now.

47
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
If you care about me,get the pie out of the man's hood.

48
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
- Get the what?- There's a pie in the hood. Go!

49
00:03:08 --> 00:03:08
What are you doing?

50
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
I'm sorry.My pie was in your hood.

51
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
I have to get the coffeeout of that guy's pants...

52
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
...and I'll be backin the hospital by 7.

53
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
Damn it, Ross!Get your butt out of the bathroom!

54
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

55
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
Blow-drying what?You have no hair.

56
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
What's going on?

57
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
Your boyfriend has beenin there for an hour!

58
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
It's like I'm living with him again.

59
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
He's here when I go to sleep andwake up and when I want to shower.

60
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
I feel like I'm 16 again.

61
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
Well, you're not 16.You're both adults now.

62
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
Get out, you doofus!

63
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
Or, you know,he's rubber and you're glue.

64
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
All yours.

65
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
I hope you cleaned your hairout of the drain.

66
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
Shut up!

67
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Cut it out!

68
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
I've never wanted you more.

69
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
So what do you say, boys?Should I call him?

70
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
You know what they say:

71
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Ask your slippers a question...

72
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
...you're going crazy.

73
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
I'm sorry I didn't make itover there today.

74
00:04:40 --> 00:04:41
That's okay.

75
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
You had a thing.

76
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
I hear the place looks great.

77
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
Forget about it.I'm having a ball!

78
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
How's the apartment?

79
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
It's terrific.I mean, it's a regular space...

80
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
...- fest!

81
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
Well, great.

82
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
Yeah, I just...

83
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
...wanted to call and say hey.

84
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
Well, okay.

85
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
Was that the oven timer?

86
00:05:05 --> 00:05:06
That's right, my friend.

87
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
It's time for...

88
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
... Baywatch!

89
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Can you believe they gaveStephanie skin cancer?

90
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
I can't believethey made her lieutenant!

91
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
You're saying that becauseyou love Yasmine Bleeth.

92
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
How could anyonenot love Yasmine Bleeth?

93
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
Hey, they're running.

94
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
See, this is thebrilliance of the show.

95
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
I say always keep them running.

96
00:05:32 --> 00:05:33
All the time running!

97
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Run!

98
00:05:35 --> 00:05:36
Run!

99
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

100
00:05:40 --> 00:05:41
But you wanted to live by yourself.

101
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
I did. I thought it'd be great.

102
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
I figured I'd have time alonewith my thoughts.

103
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
But it turns out I don't haveas many thoughts as you think.

104
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
Why don't you talk to Chandlerabout moving back?

105
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
You really think he'd take me?

106
00:05:55 --> 00:05:56
We had a good talk last night...

107
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
...but when I moved out,I hurt him bad.

108
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
He would definitely want you back.

109
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
I'm telling you,there's no way he's moving back.

110
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
But we had one of the greatest talkswe ever had last night.

111
00:06:07 --> 00:06:08
I mean, it was...

112
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
It was like when we firststarted living together.

113
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
I know you don't wantto hear this right now...

114
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
...but we've seen himin his new place. And he's happy.

115
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
He's decorated.

116
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
Chandler, he has moved on, okay?You have to, too.

117
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
You'll have to accept the factthat you're just friends now.

118
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
You're not...

119
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
...roommates anymore.

120
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
Okay, Phoebe.You ready to try one?

121
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
Smelly cat, smelly cat

122
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
What are they feeding you?

123
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
Really bad smelling smelly cat

124
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
Whoa! Oh, my God!

125
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
I mean, like, who was that?

126
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
They're your backup singers.Behind you, hon.

127
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
I thought they were just watching me.

128
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
Like at an aquarium, you know?

129
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
All right.

130
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
From the top.

131
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
Smelly cat, smelly cat

132
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
What are they feeding you?

133
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
Okay, sorry.

134
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
I'm just not getting...

135
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
...that everyone gets...

136
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
...how smellythis cat actually is.

137
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
Maybe if we could talk about this...

138
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
...because I need to feelthat you really care about the cat.

139
00:07:25 --> 00:07:26
We can talk.

140
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
It's just that this costs$ 100 a minute to be in here.

141
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
So the cat stinks,but you love it. Let's go.

142
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
No, there is no wayhe was a velociraptor.

143
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

144
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
If Dino was a velociraptor,he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

145
00:07:42 --> 00:07:43
Were you taking a nap?

146
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
I was.

147
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
Tony, can you hold on?That's the other line.

148
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Yeah, she's here,but can she call you back?

149
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
Okay, thanks.

150
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
Call Joanna.

151
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
Did she leave a number?

152
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
Did you see me write one down?

153
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

154
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
She'll call back.Don't be such a baby.

155
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
You're the baby.

156
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
- Get off my back.- Get out of my face.

157
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

158
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
Yeah, she's right here.Hold on.

159
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
Tony, can I call you back?

160
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
That's my sister's boyfriend.

161
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
Give me that.

162
00:08:21 --> 00:08:26
Sweetie, before I forget, did Ileave my diaphragm at your place?

163
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
Hi, Mom.

164
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
So how's the palace?

165
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
It's funny you should mention thatbecause I was thinking...

166
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
What's with the boxes?

167
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
Actually, I have some news.

168
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
Is that Joey guy gonna pick uphis moose hat or should I toss it?

169
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
Why don't you ask him yourself?This is my new roommate, Eddie.

170
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
Nice to meet you.

171
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
- Likewise.- How you doing?

172
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
I'll take that.

173
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
It's what I came for.

174
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
This is new.Where'd you two meet?

175
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
At the supermarketin the ethnic food section.

176
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
I helped him pick out a chorizo.

177
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
We got to talking. He neededa place, and I had a spare room.

178
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
Now it's a spare room?

179
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Well, yeah.In that it's not being used...

180
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
...and I have it to spare.

181
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
Well, I got what I came for.

182
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
I'll see you.

183
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
Hey, Joe.

184
00:09:39 --> 00:09:43
When'd you start usingmoose in your hair?

185
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
Is this guy great, or what?

186
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
Yeah, he is.

187
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
I can't believe he hasa new roommate. Who is he?

188
00:09:56 --> 00:09:57
Eddie. He just met him.

189
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
It'll never last.He's just a rebound roommate.

190
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
Check it out! Check it out!

191
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
It's "Smelly Cat", the video!

192
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
Now, I haven't seen it yet,so if you don't like it...

193
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
...so what?None of you ever made a video.

194
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

195
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
Smoking!

196
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
Look at me!

197
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
Smelly cat, smelly cat

198
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
What are they feeding you?

199
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
Smelly cat, smelly cat

200
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
It's not your fault

201
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
Really bad smelling smelly cat

202
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
It's not your fault

203
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Smelly cat, smelly cat

204
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
- Oh, my God!- I know.

205
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
I sound amazing!

206
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
They won't take you to the vet

207
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
You're obviously not their favorite pet

208
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
Smelly cat, smelly cat

209
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
It's not your fault

210
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
I've never heard myself sing before.

211
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
I mean, except in my own head.

212
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
This is so cool!Now I can hear what you hear!

213
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
Pretty different, huh?

214
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
I am sorry,but I'm incredibly talented!

215
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
Smelly cat, smelly cat

216
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
It's not your fault

217
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
What's going on, man?

218
00:11:38 --> 00:11:38
Eddie.

219
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
Morning.

220
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
I just came by to pick up my mail.

221
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
- Where's the mail?- Over there on the table.

222
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
You don't keep iton this table anymore?

223
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
Eddie likes it over there.

224
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
All right, here you go, my friend.Eggs á la Eddie.

225
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
That's great.

226
00:12:03 --> 00:12:04
What?

227
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
I thought you liked your eggs...

228
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
...with the bread with the holein the middle, á la me!

229
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
I do, but Eddie makes them this way.They're pretty darn good.

230
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
Well, you guys...

231
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
...I'm out of here.

232
00:12:16 --> 00:12:16
See you, pals.

233
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
See you.

234
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
- How are you two getting along?- I couldn't be happier.

235
00:12:23 --> 00:12:24
Great.

236
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
I'm happy for you.

237
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
All right, that's it!

238
00:12:30 --> 00:12:35
He just comes in here,Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

239
00:12:35 --> 00:12:40
...with his moving the mailand his "See you, pals".

240
00:12:41 --> 00:12:42
And now there's no juice!

241
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
There's no juice for the peoplewho need the juice. I need the juice!

242
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
There's another carton there.

243
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
This isn't about juice anymore,all right, man?

244
00:12:52 --> 00:12:52
All right.

245
00:12:53 --> 00:12:53
So what's it about?

246
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
Eggs!

247
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
Whose eggs do you like better,his or mine?

248
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
- Well, I like both eggs equally.- Oh, come on!

249
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
Nobody likes two eggs equally.I wanna know which one you like better.

250
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
What's the difference?Your eggs aren't here anymore.

251
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
You took your eggs and you left!

252
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
Did you expect meto never find new eggs?

253
00:13:14 --> 00:13:15
I wanna watch "Entertainment Tonight".

254
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
Predators of the Serengeti.

255
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
Would you guys stop!

256
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
It's my TV!

257
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
- Quit it!- Bite me!

258
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
Monica keeps changing the channel.

259
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
That's great.Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

260
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

261
00:13:31 --> 00:13:32
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

262
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
...this weird little Gellerdimension thing, okay?

263
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
So I'm gonna go takea nice long hot bubble bath...

264
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
...because you kidsare driving me crazy!

265
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
What do we do about this?

266
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
We could tape "Entertainment Tonight".

267
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
Not that!

268
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
This! Us!

269
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
Oh, my God, Ross, it's...You're just...

270
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
Since you've been here,you're driving me...

271
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
Mon, you've gone ultrasonicagain, all right?

272
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
I just can't stand you being here...

273
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
...all the time!

274
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
Why? Why can't youstand me being here?

275
00:14:02 --> 00:14:03
We're just having fun.

276
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
Fun? You think this is fun?

277
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
I thought we were fooling around,like when we were kids.

278
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
I hated you when we were kids!

279
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
You hated me when we were kids?

280
00:14:14 --> 00:14:15
I hated you.

281
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
I loved you in a you're-my-brother-so-I-have-to way...

282
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
...but basically, I hated your guts.

283
00:14:20 --> 00:14:21
Why did you hate me?

284
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
Because you were mean to me...

285
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
...and you teased meand you always got your way.

286
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
That wasn't fun for you?

287
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
I can't believe you hated me.

288
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
But now I love you.

289
00:14:39 --> 00:14:40
And not just because I have to.

290
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
Really?

291
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
You're just gonna haveto stop pissing me off.

292
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
I can do that.

293
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
Then I won't have to kill you.

294
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
So you wanna watch"Entertainment Tonight"?

295
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
Thanks.

296
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
You know what?

297
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
If you really wanna watchthat Serengeti thing, we can.

298
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
Listen, you are notgoing to believe this...

299
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
...but that is not mesinging on the video.

300
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
How did you find out?

301
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
The record company sent this paperfor me to sign saying it's okay...

302
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
...for someone else to sing for me.That was my first clue.

303
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33
What will you do?

304
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
I can't work with peoplewho would do this.

305
00:15:35 --> 00:15:36
Sure.

306
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
I mean, this poor woman.

307
00:15:39 --> 00:15:39
What woman?

308
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
The voice woman.

309
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
She has a great voice,but she doesn't have a video.

310
00:15:44 --> 00:15:45
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

311
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
I have a video. Pay attention.

312
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
This voice woman, she's so talented.

313
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
But according to the producer people,she doesn't have the right look.

314
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
She's like one of thoseanimals at the pound...

315
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
...who nobody wantsbecause they're not pretty.

316
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
Or you know, like some old dogwho's kind of like stinky and...

317
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
Oh, my God! She's "smelly cat"!

318
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
That song has so many levels.

319
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
Hey, Eddie.

320
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
You wanna play some foosball?

321
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
No, thanks, man.I'm not really into sports.

322
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
Yeah, okay. All right.

323
00:16:25 --> 00:16:29
Doesn't matter.Time for "Baywatch"!

324
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
You like that show?

325
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
You don't?

326
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
It's just pretty peoplerunning around on the beach.

327
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
That's the brilliance of it.

328
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
The pretty people.

329
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
And the running.

330
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
I'm gonna go read in my roomfor a little while.

331
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
Okay, man.

332
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
I think of all the friends I've known

333
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
But when I dial the telephone

334
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
No one's home

335
00:17:18 --> 00:17:23
All by myself

336
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
Don't wanna live

337
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
All by myself

338
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
Anymore

339
00:17:31 --> 00:17:36
All by myself

340
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
Smelly cat, smelly cat

341
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
What are they feeding you?Everybody!

342
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
Smelly cat, smelly cat

343
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
It's not your fault

344
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
They won't take you to the vet

345
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
You're obviously not their favorite pet

346
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
You may not be a bed of roses

347
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
To those with noses

348
00:17:59 --> 00:18:03
Ross, those are the only lines we have.Back to the chorus!
