1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:06
I can't believe we've neverdone this. It's so good!

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
It's so good for Monica.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
Time's up! My turn.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
- That was half an hour?- It's your timer.

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
I don't like to brag about it,but I give the best massages.

6
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
All right, then massage me upright nice!

7
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
It's so good, isn't it?

8
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
I don't know whatI did to deserve it.

9
00:00:33 --> 00:00:34
Say goodbye to sore muscles!

10
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
Goodbye, muscles!

11
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
The One with Joey's Bag

12
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
She gives the worst massages ever!

13
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
It was like she was torturing mefor information.

14
00:01:22 --> 00:01:26
I wanted to give it up.I just didn't know what it was!

15
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
If it hurts that bad,you should tell her.

16
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
For the first time,I'm in a real relationship.

17
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
I won't screw that upby telling the truth.

18
00:01:35 --> 00:01:36
Dude, look out!

19
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
You almost crushed my hat.

20
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
Sorry.

21
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
And the bunny got away.

22
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
This would be the placewhere you explain the hat.

23
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
There's this play, right?

24
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
I'm up for the part of thiscool, suave, international guy.

25
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
A clothes horse, so I figure...

26
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
...everyone at the audition willwear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

27
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
And you'll make them disappear?

28
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
Like you could find somethingthis sophisticated.

29
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
Done!

30
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
If you want to look good,come to the store. I'll help you.

31
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
- Thanks!- Sure.

32
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
Please, take those off!

33
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?

34
00:02:22 --> 00:02:25
Only okay. Because I justgot back from the hospital.

35
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
Are you all right?

36
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
I'm fine.But my grandma sort of died.

37
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
Pheebs, sorry.

38
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
It's okay.

39
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
She had a really incredible life.

40
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
It's not like I won't see her again.She'll visit.

41
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
Maybe she's with us right now.

42
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
Right. She's on a new spiritual plainand she'll come to the coffeehouse.

43
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
I just saw two people having sexin a car right outside!

44
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
Pheebs' grandmother just died.

45
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

46
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
Actually, it's kind of cool.Because it's like...

47
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
...you know, one life endsand another begins.

48
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
Not the way they're doing it.

49
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
What happened?How did she die?

50
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
We were in the market...

51
00:03:08 --> 00:03:13
...and she bent down to get some yogurtand never came back up again.

52
00:03:13 --> 00:03:14
I'm so sorry.

53
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
The last thing she said was:

54
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,and we'll meet at the checkout counter."

55
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
You know what?

56
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
We will meet at the checkout counter.

57
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
Since you're returningall this stuff...

58
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
...you'll have to wear underwear.

59
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
All right.You'd better show me that too.

60
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
It's missing something.

61
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
Really? A purse?

62
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
It's not a purse.It's a shoulder bag.

63
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
It looks like a woman's purse.

64
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
Trust me, all the men are carryingthem in the spring catalog.

65
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
See, look.Men carrying the bag.

66
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
See, look.Women carrying the bag.

67
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
But it is odd how a woman's purselooks so good on me, a man.

68
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
Exactly. Unisex!

69
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
Maybe you need sex.I had sex a couple days ago.

70
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.

71
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
I ain't going to say no to that!

72
00:04:31 --> 00:04:32
- Who is it?- It's Phoebe.

73
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Oh, great!

74
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
Oh, you.

75
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
What's up?

76
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
Well, I sort of have some bad news.Can I come in?

77
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
No, thanks.

78
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
Grandma died today.

79
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
Didn't she die like five years ago?

80
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
No, she just died today.

81
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
We're havinga memorial service tomorrow.

82
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
Okay, I know I went to that already.

83
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
No, you didn't!

84
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Then who's been dead?

85
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
Lots of people!

86
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
Look, are you coming or not?

87
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
I thought she was dead,so I've made my peace.

88
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
Plus I'm going to a concert.

89
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
I'd invite you,but I only have two tickets left.

90
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
- Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.- Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!

91
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
You look just like your son,Mrs. Tribbiani.

92
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
What? Are you referringto my man's bag?

93
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
I thought it just looked good,but it's practical too.

94
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
It's got compartments for yourwallet, keys, address book...

95
00:05:47 --> 00:05:48
Your makeup.

96
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
What are you doing?The audition's tomorrow.

97
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.

98
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
You get mustard on that bag,you can't return it.

99
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
Why would I return this?I love this bag!

100
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
- All right, then you owe me $350.- Fine.

101
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?

102
00:06:06 --> 00:06:10
Relax, I'll pay you with the moneyfrom the job I'll get. Thanks to you.

103
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
What's the part? Auntie Mame?

104
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
Don't listen to them.I think it's sexy.

105
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
You-and-I sexy?

106
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.Thank you for coming.

107
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
Here's your 3-D glasses.

108
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
Reverend Pong will saywhen to put them on.

109
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
Hi, sweetie.

110
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
- How are you holding up?- Fine.

111
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.

112
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
You know what?My grandma had the exact same bag!

113
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
I brought you flowers.

114
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
Oh, thanks!

115
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
Pulling flowers outmakes the bag look masculine.

116
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
Excuse me, is this the memorial?

117
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
Welcome.

118
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
Here's your 3-D glasses.

119
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
All right.

120
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
So how did you know Frances?

121
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.

122
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
But I was pretty tightwith her and her daughter.

123
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
What's your name?

124
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
Frank Buffay.

125
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
You know what? Strike that.My name, actually, is Joe.

126
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
Joe Hill.

127
00:07:17 --> 00:07:18
You're Frank Buf...

128
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
No! Joe Hill.

129
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
You just said...

130
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
I got to go.Thank you so much for coming.

131
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
Oh, my God!

132
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
What happened?

133
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
That was my dad.

134
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
Check it out!

135
00:07:34 --> 00:07:37
It's like it's coming right at me.

136
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
- Did you catch him?- What did he say?

137
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."

138
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
I couldn't give him my real name.

139
00:07:50 --> 00:07:50
Why not?

140
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
You saw the way he ran.

141
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
You think he'd talkto the daughter he abandoned?

142
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
What did you say to him?

143
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
I said I was the executor of the willand I needed to talk to him.

144
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
I'm going to meet himat the coffeehouse.

145
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
Could everyone take their seats?

146
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
I just can't think about that now.

147
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
I want to say goodbye to my grandma.

148
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
Let's go say goodbye.

149
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
I'm off to my audition.How do I look?

150
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
Great!That bag will get you that part.

151
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
And a date with a man.

152
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
You know what? Make fun all you want.This is a great bag.

153
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
And it's as handy as it is becoming.

154
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
Just because you don't understandsomething, doesn't make it wrong.

155
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
You guys have to get usedto the fact that Joey...

156
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
...comes with a bag!

157
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
I've got to meet my dad.

158
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
Will you tell him who you are?

159
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
Not at first.I don't want to freak him out.

160
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
But aren't you pissed at him?

161
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
This guy abandoned you.

162
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
If it were me, this guy would bein some serious physical danger.

163
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
I'd walk in there,I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!"

164
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
"You and me, outside.Right now!"

165
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
I kind of scared myself.

166
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
Well, at least you scared someone.

167
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
You'd think I'd be angry.

168
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
You'd think I'd want to riphis tiny little head off!

169
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
Fortunately, I'm past it.

170
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
You do seem a little tense.Here, let me help you.

171
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
Get off!

172
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
Stop it!Why are you doing that to me?

173
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
What are you talking about?

174
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
As a masseuse and a human...

175
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
...I'm begging you,never do that to anyone!

176
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
I give good massages.

177
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
I gave them to Rachelbefore she got allergic.

178
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
And Chandler, he loves them!Watch.

179
00:09:44 --> 00:09:45
He does not like it.He's in pain!

180
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
- No, he's not.- Yes, he is!

181
00:09:48 --> 00:09:52
- What?- I'm sorry but...

182
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
You've been lying to me?

183
00:09:56 --> 00:09:57
I can't believe that.

184
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.

185
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
But the minute we startto lie to each other...

186
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
And by "we"...

187
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
...I mean society.

188
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
Anytime you're ready.

189
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
Well, you must be new here.

190
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
Maybe we get a table,I buy you a drink.

191
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
Could you try it without the purse?

192
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
Yeah, sure.

193
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
Well, you must be new here.Maybe we sit...

194
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
Can I ask you something?

195
00:10:28 --> 00:10:29
Sure. What?

196
00:10:29 --> 00:10:33
Well, first,it's not a purse.

197
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
Anytime.

198
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
If you thinkit's a woman's bag, it's not.

199
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
It's a man's bag.

200
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
Okay. And go!

201
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
Let me show you the catalog.

202
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
Look. See?

203
00:10:46 --> 00:10:47
It's the latest thing.

204
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
Everyone's got one.Men, women, children.

205
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Do you sell these?

206
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
No, these babies sell themselves.

207
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
Thank you.That was great.

208
00:10:58 --> 00:10:59
But I didn't read anything.

209
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
I think we've seen enough.

210
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
All right, I'll see you.

211
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
We got it. We got it.

212
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
Is Rachel here?

213
00:11:10 --> 00:11:14
Listen, I just wanted to apologizeabout the whole massage thing.

214
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
I really like them.

215
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
Please stop!

216
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
We're supposed to be honest.

217
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
I wish you could tell me,"I don't like your massages."

218
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
I don't like your massages.

219
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
See? It's no big deal.

220
00:11:34 --> 00:11:35
But now you're crying!

221
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
I'm not crying about that.I'm crying about something at work.

222
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
My boyfriend saidhe didn't like my massages.

223
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
You don't haveto be best at everything.

224
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
Oh, my God!You don't know me at all!

225
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
You give the worst massagesin the world.

226
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
I'm crying here!

227
00:11:55 --> 00:11:56
Look, hear me out.

228
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
You give the best bad massages.

229
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
If anybody was lookingfor the best bad massage...

230
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
...and they thought,"Who's the best?"

231
00:12:04 --> 00:12:07
They'd have to go to you.

232
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
So you're saying thatif there was an award...

233
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
...for the best bad massage...Who would get that?

234
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
It would be you!

235
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
You, Monica!And you'd get all the votes.

236
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
So they could call the award,"The Monica"?

237
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
Absolutely.

238
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
I suck!

239
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
Thank you for meeting me.

240
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
Thank you.

241
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
Come sit.

242
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
Sit.

243
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
Sit!

244
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
Alrighty.Before we get started, I need you...

245
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
...to state for the recordthat you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.

246
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
Yes, I am.

247
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
What did Frances leave me?

248
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
That's why you wanted me to come.

249
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
Yes, she did. She left you...

250
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
...this lipstick.

251
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
It's used.

252
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
Cool!

253
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
I have just a few questions to ask,so I'll get out my official forms.

254
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
So question one:

255
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
You were married to Frances'daughter, Lilly. Correct?

256
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
Yes, I was.

257
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
Question two:Did that marriage end...

258
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
A: Happily?

259
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
B: Medium?

260
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
Or C: In the total abandonment...

261
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
...of her and her two children?

262
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
It really says that?

263
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
Yeah, see?

264
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
I guess then I would have to say C.

265
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
Total abandonment.

266
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
Reasons for abandonment:

267
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
A: Top secret government work.

268
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
B: Amnesia.

269
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
Or C: You're just a selfish,irresponsible...

270
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
...bad, bad man.

271
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
I don't want the lipstick that much.

272
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
Would you do me a favor?

273
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
Would you give Lilly...

274
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
...that, please?

275
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
When you see Lilly,give her that note.

276
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
I wanted to talk to herat the memorial...

277
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
...but I pictured her getting madthe way you did, and I chickened out.

278
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
I wrote her a note.Give it to her, please?

279
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
But you came to see Lilly?

280
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
Yeah. Why?

281
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
Lilly's dead.

282
00:14:31 --> 00:14:32
She what?

283
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
She's dead.

284
00:14:34 --> 00:14:34
Are you sure?

285
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
If she isn't, cremating herwas a big mistake.

286
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
I can't believe this.I just can't believe...

287
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
How?Oh, my God.

288
00:14:44 --> 00:14:44
How long ago?

289
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
17 years ago.

290
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
What about the girls?

291
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
Well, Ursula is a waitressand she lives in Soho.

292
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
And Phoebe...

293
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
...is on this couch.

294
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.Big day for you!

295
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
Phoebe, I...

296
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
It's just, I don't know what to say.

297
00:15:19 --> 00:15:24
I just can't believe that you'remy daughter. You're so pretty.

298
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
Yes, well, that's neitherhere nor there.

299
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
Would it make you feelbetter if I said...

300
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
...that I was very, very sorry I left?

301
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
It doesn't matter what you say.It won't make a difference.

302
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
So you can just go.

303
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
Well, you know, in my defense,I was a lousy father.

304
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
- That's your defense?- Yes, it is.

305
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
I burned the formula,and I put your diapers on backwards.

306
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
I made up a song to sing to you,but that made you cry even more.

307
00:15:55 --> 00:15:56
You make up songs?

308
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
Well, no, just that one.But it was stupid.

309
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
Let's see, how did it go?

310
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

311
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
Why won't you go to sleep?

312
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

313
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
You're keeping me up

314
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
I'm not very good at this.

315
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
Well, I am.

316
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
Not yet. No.

317
00:16:43 --> 00:16:44
How'd the audition go?

318
00:16:44 --> 00:16:45
Estelle said I didn't get it.

319
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
What? Why?Joey, you were so ready for it.

320
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
I thought so too...

321
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
...but the casting peoplehad problems with me.

322
00:16:52 --> 00:16:53
What kind of problem?

323
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
To tell you the truth...

324
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
...they had a problem with the bag!

325
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
You know what?It was a stupid play anyway.

326
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
It's time to give up the bag.

327
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
I don't want to give up the bag.

328
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
I don't have to give it up,do I, Rach?

329
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
You think I should give up the bag!

330
00:17:12 --> 00:17:17
Joey, I'm sorry. As terrificas I think you are with it...

331
00:17:17 --> 00:17:22
...I just don't know if the worldis ready for you and your bag.

332
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
I can't believe this!

333
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
Wait, I'm not sayingyou shouldn't have a bag.

334
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
There are other bagsthat are maybe a little less...

335
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
...controversial.

336
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
Yeah, they're called wallets.
