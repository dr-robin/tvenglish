1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
I'm Phoebe Buffay and I havebabies coming out.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
Have you started having contractions?

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
Not yet. I heard they really hurt.Do they?

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
Which of you is the father?

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
None of them are.The father is my brother.

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
I'll miss watching youfreak people out like that.

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
This is for the babiesto look at someday.

9
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Do you want to say anythingbefore it starts?

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
Hi, kids! It's me, Aunt Phoebe.

11
00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
Can't wait to see you.Please don't hurt me!

12
00:00:38 --> 00:00:39
What took you so long?

13
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
Your cab left when ours did.

14
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
We went back becauseI forgot my jacket.

15
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
You're not wearing one.

16
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
Oh, man!I did it again!

17
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
Someone has to callFrank and Alice.

18
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
My mom might...What are you doing?

19
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
I've got to get the "before" shot!

20
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
The One Hundredth

21
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
We spoke to the nurse.The reason your doctor is late...

22
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
...is because she's not coming.

23
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
She hit her head in the shower.

24
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

25
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
Pheebs, it's going to be okay.

26
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
I don't see three kidscoming out of your vagina!

27
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
Listen. The nurse saidthe doctor is wonderful.

28
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
He's head of the department.

29
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
All right. Oh, dear God, save me!

30
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
I'm having my first contraction!

31
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
Oh! It's not bad.

32
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
And so the miracle of birth begins.And I...

33
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
You okay?

34
00:02:19 --> 00:02:20
Something hurts.

35
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
It's sympathy pains.That's so sweet!

36
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
I didn't know I cared that much.

37
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
I'm Dr. Harad.I'll be delivering your babies.

38
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
You'll be in good hands.I've been doing this a long time.

39
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
I'll be back to do your internal.

40
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
Just relax, everything looks great.

41
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
And also, I love Fonzie.

42
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

43
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
That's what it sounded like.

44
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
All right.

45
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
Am I late?Nobody came out yet, right?

46
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
No, we haven't started yet.Where's Alice?

47
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Delaware. Until she gets here,I'll be your coach.

48
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
Don't worry. She told meabout the LaMazda stuff.

49
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
If you get the babies outby month's end...

50
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
...you get two percent financing.

51
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
Monica, you're going to bevery proud of me.

52
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
I just got us dates with twounbelievably cute nurses.

53
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
Oh, my!

54
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
They're male nurses.

55
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
Not in my head.

56
00:03:21 --> 00:03:26
They want to take us outSaturday night! What do you say?

57
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
I don't think so.

58
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
What're you talking about?

59
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
You've been telling me toget over Ross and move on.

60
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
I'm moving on and so are you.

61
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
Why don't you want to go?

62
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
Why don't you give mea good reason...

63
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
...and I'll tell you if it's true.

64
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
- What?- Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

65
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
You're coming.And when they get off...

66
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

67
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
There's always room for Jello.

68
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
How do you make that dirty?

69
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
It's easy.I can do it with anything.

70
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
Grandma's chicken salad...

71
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
Get a shot of this.

72
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
These are the headlineswhen you were born.

73
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
Now girl baby, turn away.And boy babies...

74
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
...check it out!

75
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
This is what naked womenlooked like when you were born.

76
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

77
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
Okay, I'm having another one!

78
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
This one doesn't hurt eith...Yes it does!

79
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
I was kind of hoping that was it.

80
00:04:41 --> 00:04:42
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

81
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
A couple of nurses asked them out.

82
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
Really? Male nurses?

83
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
Yeah, I was bummed too.

84
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
So they're going on dates?

85
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
- When?- I think Saturday.

86
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
- What's with him?- Sympathy pains.

87
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
It was sweet at first, but now I thinkhe's trying to steal my thunder.

88
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
Let's see what we got here.

89
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

90
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
This Fonzie person youkeep referring to...

91
00:05:11 --> 00:05:12
...is that another doctor?

92
00:05:12 --> 00:05:13
Oh, no, no.

93
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
Fonzie is the nickname ofArthur Fonzerelli.

94
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
"The Fonz."

95
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
All right.

96
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
It's not that weird, is it?

97
00:05:26 --> 00:05:27
It's very weird!

98
00:05:27 --> 00:05:32
I don't want some guy down theretelling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo".

99
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
He doesn't seem to beimpersonating Fonzie...

100
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
What are you doing?

101
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
Why are you defending him?Just get me another doctor...

102
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
...who isn't crazyand doesn't Fonzie!

103
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
Again, it's not...

104
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
Hey, there you are!

105
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
There's something you should know.

106
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
Is this about you dating the nurse?Joey told me.

107
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
I am so fine. You and I,we're just, nothing.

108
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
Just goofing around.

109
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
I was about to tell youI was getting out of it.

110
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
But if we're just "goofing around",maybe I will go out with him.

111
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
Fine. Maybe I will too.

112
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
Hey! Look what I foundin the gift shop...

113
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
Get up! Get up! Get up!

114
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
This is Dr. Oberman.

115
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
He has no strong feelingsabout Fonzie...

116
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
...or any of the "Happy Days" gang.

117
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
You're going into what grade?

118
00:06:33 --> 00:06:36
I'm actually a first-year resident.I graduated early.

119
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
Me too.

120
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
I should have specifiedI'd need a grown-up doctor.

121
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
Really, I'm fully qualified...

122
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
"Doogie!"

123
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
Doesn't anybody understand thatI'm going to be having babies soon?

124
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
Go, little boy! Go!

125
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

126
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraidyou've got kidney stones.

127
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
Well, what else could it be?

128
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
It's kidney stones.

129
00:07:08 --> 00:07:09
Or...

130
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
Kidney stones.

131
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
You're getting there.

132
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
These babies are very, very lucky.

133
00:07:17 --> 00:07:18
They are? Why?

134
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
They'll be bornon the Fonz's half-birthday.

135
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
Happy Birthday.

136
00:07:25 --> 00:07:26
Just to clarify.

137
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
I'm not Fonzie.

138
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
It's a terrific thing you're havingthese babies for Frank and Alice.

139
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
I know, it is.

140
00:07:40 --> 00:07:43
Can I tell you a secret?

141
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
I want to keep one.

142
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Oh, I'm going to be on the news.

143
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
You must be kidding.

144
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
You know you can't keepone of these babies.

145
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
Maybe I can. You don't know.

146
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
I do. Frank and Alice willwant to keep all their children.

147
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
Maybe not. You know?

148
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
Three babies are a handful.

149
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

150
00:08:09 --> 00:08:14
I hate to miss an opportunitybecause I didn't ask.

151
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
Phoebe, no.This is insane.

152
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
Just ask him.

153
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
What? Me?

154
00:08:19 --> 00:08:19
I can't ask him!

155
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
Do you know how inappropriatethat would be?

156
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
All I'm saying is,just talk to Frank.

157
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
Just feel him out.

158
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
No. I will not ask Frankto give you one of his kids.

159
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
You're right.

160
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
Tell him it's for you.

161
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
Feeling better, sweetie?

162
00:08:42 --> 00:08:43
Maybe a little.

163
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

164
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Me too.

165
00:08:49 --> 00:08:50
I just heard. What's up?

166
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
Kidney stones!

167
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
Ordinarily, we try to breakthe stones up with shock waves.

168
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
But they're too close to the bladder.

169
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
Either we wait for you to pass themor else go up the urethra...

170
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
No, no, no, no.Nothing is going "up", okay?

171
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
"Up" is not an option.What's a urethra?

172
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
Are you crazy?

173
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
Did you ask him?

174
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
No, I haven't had a chance yet.

175
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
I'm kind of on a clock here.

176
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
Oh, Fonzie.

177
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
You know who I always liked?Mork.

178
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
Undo it. Undo it.

179
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
Fonzie met Mork.

180
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
Mork froze Fonzie.

181
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
But Fonzie was already cool.

182
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
So he wasn't hurt. Right?

183
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
How you doing?

185
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

186
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
You know, Alice is goingto be here so soon.

187
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
You couldn't just do me a favorand, like, hold them in?

188
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
Sorry, I'm in the middle ofthe last favor you asked me to do.

189
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
This is Dan, one of the guyswe're dating on Saturday.

190
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
Nice to meet you.

191
00:10:21 --> 00:10:26
I'm really looking forwardto Saturday night. Really!

192
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
So Dan...

193
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
Nurse, not a doctor, huh?

194
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
Kind of girlie, isn't it?

195
00:10:34 --> 00:10:39
That's okay. I'm doing this toget through medical school.

196
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
And it didn't feel "girlie"during the Gulf War.

197
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
Sure.

198
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
Thanks for doing that for us,by the way.

199
00:10:52 --> 00:10:53
Why wait till Saturday?Are you free tomorrow?

200
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
Sure.I'll get somebody to cover me.

201
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
Great!

202
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?

203
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
- No.- All right, very good!

204
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
This is a big one.

205
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
Get these things out of me!

206
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.

207
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
I want the drugs, Ross!

208
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
I do too! I do too!

209
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
Yeah, I love you.Okay, bye.

210
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
That was Alice's mom.Alice left five hours ago.

211
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
She should be here.

212
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
She'll make it on time.

213
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
So Frank...

214
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
Three babies.That just seems like a lot, huh?

215
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
Not to me.

216
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
Fair enough.

217
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
You're at ten centimeters.Time to start having babies.

218
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
I want only the father here.

219
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
- We love you.- Good luck.

220
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
I need a clamp, a sterile toweland Channel 31.

221
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01

223
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
Oh, no, no! It's a good one.Fonzie plays the bongos.

224
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
Ready? Time to try pushing.

225
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
Ready? Time to try peeing.

226
00:12:14 --> 00:12:19
Wait, wait, wait, wait!It's almost time to try peeing.

227
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
Push. Concentrate on pushing.

228
00:12:21 --> 00:12:22
I see the head.

229
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
Yes, it is a head!

230
00:12:25 --> 00:12:26
Keep pushing. Come on.

231
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
I can't believe somebody's coming out!

232
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
There's somebody coming out of you!

233
00:12:31 --> 00:12:32
It's my son!

234
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
All right.

235
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
Here's your first baby!

236
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
Yes! We got a baby boy!

237
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
Frank Junior, Junior!

238
00:12:45 --> 00:12:46
How does he look?

239
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
So gross!

240
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
Okay. You ready to push again?

241
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
I already had a baby.Leave me alone!

242
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
Come on, you can do it!You can do it!

243
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07

244
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
Oh, my God! I can't believeI have two children.

245
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
How scary is that?

246
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
Come on, little Chandler,it's time to be born.

247
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
He's coming!Yes, he's coming!

248
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
Hey, where's his thing?

249
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
Chandler's a girl!

250
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
Oh, God! Kindergarten flashback.

251
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
They read the sonogram wrong,because they thought it was a boy.

252
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
But Chandler's a girl!

253
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
Okay, keep saying it.

254
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
- Am I too late?- No, no. Everything's okay.

255
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

256
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
We have our babies?

257
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
We have our babies.

258
00:14:03 --> 00:14:04
Oh, my God!

259
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
You did it, man.

260
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
Would you like to see them?

261
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
They're so small.

262
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
- I'll call you tomorrow.- Great.

263
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
Are you really going to datethat nurse man?

264
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
You and I are just"goofing around".

265
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
I thought, why not"goof around" with him?

266
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
I don't know if you've looked up"goofing around" in the dictionary.

267
00:14:37 --> 00:14:38
Well, I have...

268
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
...and the technical definition is...

269
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
..."two friends who care a lotabout each other...

270
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
...and have amazing sex...

271
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
...and just want to spendmore time together."

272
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
But if you have this newdictionary that gets you mad at me...

273
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
...then we have to get youmy original one.

274
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
I am so bad at this.

275
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
- You're better than you think you are.- Really?

276
00:15:07 --> 00:15:07
Okay. So if...

277
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
- Know when to stop.- I sensed that I should stop.

278
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
So we're okay?

279
00:15:13 --> 00:15:17
I'm gonna go tell Dan thatit's not going to happen.

280
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
- Don't do the dance.- Right.

281
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
You're my favorite.

282
00:15:25 --> 00:15:29
- Which one do you have?- I don't care.

283
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
Frank and Alice want me to tell youthey're making phone calls.

284
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
Did you talk to themabout, you know...

285
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
No, honey.

286
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
It was a long shot.

287
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
You guys? Can I just havea second alone with the babies?

288
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
So here you are.

289
00:16:13 --> 00:16:17
Seems like yesterday I was talkingto you in that petri dish.

290
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
Everyone said labor wasthe hardest thing.

291
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
But they were wrong. This is.

292
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
Well, I had the most funwith you guys.

293
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
I wish I could take you homeand see you every day.

294
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
I'll settle for beingyour favorite aunt.

295
00:16:40 --> 00:16:44
I know Alice's sister has a pool,but you lived in me.

296
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
Okay, so we're cool.

297
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
We're going to be great.

298
00:16:52 --> 00:16:55
Little high-fives.

299
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
Well, if you're going to cry...

300
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.You're amazing!

301
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
I know.

302
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
Does it hurt as bad as they say?

303
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
You won't be able to take it.

304
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
Now that little Chandler is a girl,what'll they name her?

305
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
They'll call her Chandler.

306
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
Kind of a masculine name,don't you think?

307
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
It works on you.
