1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
I just saw Kathy naked.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
It was like torture.

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
If we go to war and you're captured,you're in for a surprise.

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
It keeps getting worse.

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
I'm in love withmy roommate's girlfriend.

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
Every time we're in the same room,there's weird energy between us.

7
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
Call me crazy, butI think she likes me too.

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
And now I have seen her naked.

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
At least with her clothes on...

10
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
...I could imagine her bodywas covered in boils.

11
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
But there are no boils.She's smooth.

12
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
Smooth!

13
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
Could you see up his robe?

14
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
The One WhereChandler Crosses the Line

16
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
- Here you go.- I'll call you.

17
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
Great!

18
00:01:26 --> 00:01:27
Hey, hey. Who was that?

19
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
Casey. We're going out tonight.

20
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
Going out? Wow!

21
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
It didn't work outwith Kathy? Bummer.

22
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
No, things are fine.

23
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
I'm having a late meal with herafter an early one with Casey.

24
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
The craziest thing is,I just ate a whole pizza myself.

25
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
You're going out with Kathy!

26
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
Why are you upset?

27
00:01:50 --> 00:01:51
Well, I'm upset...

28
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
...for you.

29
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
Sex with an endless line of womenmust be unfulfilling.

30
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
What's the big deal?It's not like we're exclusive.

31
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
Look, Joey.

32
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
Kathy's not fulfillingyour emotional needs.

33
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
But, Casey...

34
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
Granted, I just sawthe back of her head.

35
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
But I got this sensethat she's smart and funny...

36
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
...and gets you.

37
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
You got all thatfrom the back of her head?

38
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
It's time to settle down.

39
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
Make a choice.Pick a lane.

40
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Who's Elaine?

41
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
Little Tony Tarzan

42
00:02:27 --> 00:02:32
Swinging with the greatest of ease

43
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
I don't know the next verse.

44
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
You could just go:

45
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Greatest of ease

46
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
Then go right into it.

47
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
I like that.

48
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
How do you know about...

49
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
You know, I used to play.

50
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
That's right.The keyboards?

51
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
A little in high school.I got into it in college.

52
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
That's whenI really found my sound.

53
00:02:58 --> 00:03:03
Juice just came out of my nose,but it was worth it.

54
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
Oh, my God!

55
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
I completely forgot aboutyour sound.

56
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
He'd lock himself in the basement.

57
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
No one was ever allowed to hear"the sound".

58
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
I want to hear "the sound".

59
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
No, I mean,I haven't played in so long.

60
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
Well, it's really personal stuff.

61
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
Play that funky music, white boy.

62
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
- Yeah, come on.- No, you guys.

63
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
My keyboards are all the way...Yeah, okay.

64
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
Okay, guys.

65
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
All right! Bring it on, you!

66
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
Here we go.

67
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
You know, I've never playedmy stuff for anyone before.

68
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
It's important that you understand...

69
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
...it's about communicating...

70
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
...very private emotions.

71
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
You know...

72
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
You should think of my work...

73
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
...as wordless sound poems.

74
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
- That's what...- My God, play!

75
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
Well, you know, that was...

76
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
...terrific!

77
00:04:50 --> 00:04:51
Really...

78
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
...bitchin'.

79
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
Wow! It was so wow!

80
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
Really?

81
00:04:58 --> 00:05:03
Yeah! I mean, you shouldplay in public.

82
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
Wow, thanks, you guys.That's...

83
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
I want to play you another piece.

84
00:05:09 --> 00:05:14
I left my helicopter soundson another disk. I'll be back.

85
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
This is so nice.I mean, I am so...

86
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
God bless my dadfor soundproofing the basement.

87
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
I can't believe I ever let himtouch me with those fingers.

88
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
What are you guys talking about?I loved it!

89
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
It was so moving.

90
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
It's so differentfrom the stuff you usually hear.

91
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
You mean, music?

92
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
I know what you think.

93
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
Yes, yes, your breastsare just as firm and juicy.

94
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
Come in.

95
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
Oh, God! Is that "Baywatch"?

96
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
Yes, but I just watch itfor the articles.

97
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
So is Joey around?

98
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
No, he's not back yet.

99
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
Come in, have a seat.Bow or stern?

100
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
I don't have a preference. You?

101
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
I like it in the stern.

102
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
Of the boat.

103
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
It's me. Casey and Ihad a little car trouble.

104
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
- We broke down.

105
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
I have to get transmission fluid.

106
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
Tell Kathy that I'm sorryand I'll be there soon.

107
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
- I think my time is about to...

108
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
I thought your time ran out.

109
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
Me too, but I guess I do have...

110
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
Joey's running a little late,and he says he's sorry.

111
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
I guess it's just you and me, then.

112
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
Yeah, I think it is.

113
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
So what'd you do today?

114
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
I had an appointmentto cut my hair.

115
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
- Looks great!- And then it got canceled.

116
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
I could cut it.

117
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
Really?

118
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
Yeah, I learned at my aunt'sdog-grooming shop. What do you say?

119
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
Dog grooming?

120
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
Don't make my tail too poofy.

121
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
You have really great hair.

122
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.

123
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
Joey also has great hair.

124
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
Yes, Joey has great hair.

125
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
I'm basically done here.Let me get this hair off your neck.

126
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
What are you doing?

127
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
Checking if it's even.

128
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
Looks good.

129
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
The phone!The phone's making sounds!

130
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
Hey, dude, it's me.

131
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
Hey, it's Joey!

132
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
It looks like we'll be stuck here.

133
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
I got the fluid.The transmission wasn't there.

134
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
- It fell out.

135
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
I just figured we hit a dog.

136
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
I want to apologize to her.

137
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
It's Joey.

138
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
No, it's fine.Don't worry about it.

139
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
Yeah, no, stop apologizing.It's okay.

140
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

141
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
I should probably go.

142
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
I forgot my purse.

143
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
I really did.I forgot my purse.

144
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
- This is bad! It's bad!- Horrible!

145
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
Wait, the kiss or the situation?

146
00:08:52 --> 00:08:53
The kiss was good.

147
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
- But that's bad!- Here's what we do.

148
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
We forget it.

149
00:08:57 --> 00:09:02
We swallow our feelings, even ifwe're unhappy forever. Sound good?

150
00:09:02 --> 00:09:03
Can you really do that?

151
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
I have to. He's my best friend.

152
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
And you're seeing him.

153
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.

154
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
But with you...

155
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
No, don't! Don't, see?

156
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
You're getting me confused.I'm starting to yearn.

157
00:09:18 --> 00:09:19
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:20 --> 00:09:24
If you want to pretend thatnothing happened, I can try.

159
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
I think we have to.

160
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
Are you still out there?

161
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
Electrifying

162
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
Infinite time

163
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
There's a Starbucksabout three blocks down.

164
00:10:00 --> 00:10:04
He's so inspired.Just look at him. Look at him go!

165
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
Thank you very much!

166
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
Hey, aren't you up next?

167
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
- I'm not playing tonight.- Why not?

168
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
I can't follow Ross.

169
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
It'd be like thosepoor bicycle-riding chimps...

170
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
...who had tofollow the Beatles. No.

171
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
Ross sucks.

172
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
The place has emptied because of him.

173
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
My God, he's not evenappreciated in his own time.

174
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
I'd give anything to not beappreciated in my own time!

175
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
You suck too.

176
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
You're awful.

177
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
You guys!

178
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
You suck too!

179
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
Man! I can't believeI locked myself out again!

180
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
Hang on, buddy.

181
00:11:17 --> 00:11:18
My God! What happened?

182
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
- Did you do all this? Why?- I sure did.

183
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
It made me feel good to dosomething nice for my friend.

184
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
You're amazing.

185
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
No, this is amazing.

186
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
A TV appears from nowhere!

187
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
The dream!

188
00:11:35 --> 00:11:36
How did you afford all this?

189
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
I'm 29. I mean, who needsa savings account?

190
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
You're the best friendanyone has ever had.

191
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
I don't know.

192
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
No, you are.

193
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
You do this, you give me advice...

194
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
What you said aboutfocusing on one woman?

195
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
I'll do that.

196
00:11:52 --> 00:11:52
With Casey?

197
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
I'll see how things go with Kathy.She's cool.

198
00:11:56 --> 00:11:57
- Or Casey.- No, Kathy.

199
00:11:58 --> 00:11:58
Could be Casey.

200
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
No, Kathy.

201
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
Consider Casey.

202
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
I think somebody'sgot a little crush on Casey.

203
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
I'll fix you two up.What do you think?

204
00:12:07 --> 00:12:12
That all the pieces of my lifeare falling right into place.

205
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
You were really great.You were really, really great.

206
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
Thanks.

207
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
Monica tells me you don't wantto play anymore because of me...

208
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
...and, you know, my talent.

209
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
Is that true?

210
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
Well, kind of, yeah.

211
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
I was trying to be really okayand upbeat about it...

212
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
...but I just feel so dwarfedby your musical gift.

213
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
See, but...

214
00:12:43 --> 00:12:47
Pheebs, that is the exactopposite intent of my music.

215
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
You know, my musicis meant to inspire.

216
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
If it bothers you this much...

217
00:12:51 --> 00:12:55
...then I won't play anymore.

218
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
No, don't do that.

219
00:12:57 --> 00:13:03
How could I live if I knew I wasdepriving the world of your music?

220
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
Hey, Chandler.Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

221
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
Joey has the best boyfriend ever!

222
00:13:17 --> 00:13:18
I kissed Kathy.

223
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
Are you serious?

224
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
- Does Joey know?- No.

225
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Is there any way you thinkhe will understand this?

226
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
You obviously haven'tscrewed over your friends.

227
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
Which we all appreciate.

228
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
If you'd told him how you feltbefore you kissed her...

229
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
...knowing Joey,he'd have stepped aside.

230
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
Don't say that!That's not true, is it?

231
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
Yeah, he loves you.

232
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
Then why didn't youtell me to do that?

233
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
I said something to Phoebe.

234
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
And I thought it wasa really good idea.

235
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
- Yeah, I remember.- Oh, my God!

236
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
What am I going to do?

237
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
You'll have to tell him.

238
00:13:53 --> 00:13:54
Why do I have to?

239
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
- Because you do.- Yeah, I know.

240
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
Would it be okayif I wrote a song about this?

241
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
Sambuca Margarita?

242
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
It that a real thing?

243
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
Well, we only had sambuca,so it is now.

244
00:14:16 --> 00:14:17
Listen, Joe. I need to...

245
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
I need to talk to you.

246
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
What's up?

247
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
It's about Kathy.

248
00:14:25 --> 00:14:26
I like her.

249
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
I like her a lot, actually.

250
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
You do?

251
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
Your timing couldn't be better.

252
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

253
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
- Yeah, she broke up with me.- When?

254
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
Just now, after acting class.

255
00:14:41 --> 00:14:46
I thought she was doing some scene,so I let people watch.

256
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
Man, I am so sorry.Are you okay?

257
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
I've been better, but I'm all right.So you like her?

258
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
Yes, but I don't have to.

259
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
No, it's okay.

260
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
You know why?Because you came to me first.

261
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
I thought that would bethe best thing to do.

262
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
You might have your workcut out for you.

263
00:15:10 --> 00:15:15
When I talked to her, I gotthe feeling she's into some other guy.

264
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
See, that's actually whatI wanted to talk to you about.

265
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
I think I know who the other guy is.

266
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
Who?

267
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
It's me.

268
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
I'm the other guy.

269
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
What?

270
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
When you were late last night,Kathy and I got to talking...

271
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
...and one thing ledto another, and...

272
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
And what?Did you sleep with her?

273
00:15:37 --> 00:15:38
No, I just kissed her.

274
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
What? That's even worse!

275
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
- How is that worse?- It's the same!

276
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
There's nothing I could do.I'm in love with her!

277
00:15:47 --> 00:15:48
Who cares?

278
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
You went behind my back?I'd never do that to you!

279
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
I have no excuses.I was totally over the line.

280
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
You're so far past the line,that you can't even see the line!

281
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
It's a dot to you!

282
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
Yes, right! And I feel horrible.You have to believe me.

283
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
Is that why you bought all this?

284
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
You know what?

285
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
I will not watch your TV.

286
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
I won't listen to your stereo.

287
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
And there's a loaf in the newbreadmaker I won't eat. Know why?

288
00:16:16 --> 00:16:16
Because...

289
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
It's all tainted with your betrayal!

290
00:16:20 --> 00:16:25
This apartment is empty to me!I'm not happy about you, either.

291
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
And just so you know...

292
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
...I made that bread for you.

293
00:16:44 --> 00:16:48
Oh, my God!He's totally lost it.

294
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
This cannot get any worse.

295
00:16:52 --> 00:16:56
Rats in the basementare hanging themselves.

296
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
Thank you. Thanks.

297
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
I lost it.

298
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
I won't play anymore.

299
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
Would you...Can you finish my set?

300
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
After that? Yeah.

301
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
No, I mean, if I can help.

302
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
Like I could lose it.

303
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
I played bad on purpose, guys.

304
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
You were playing badthis whole time.

305
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
Just that last song.
