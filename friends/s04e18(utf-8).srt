1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
It is true what they say:

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
I'm so pregnant thatmy guitar doesn't fit anymore.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
So I'm going to play my songson this drum.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
It sounds really cool!

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
Listen, listen.

7
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
Smelly cat, smelly cat

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
What are they feeding you?

9
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
That sounds great!

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
I know! And I've onlybeen playing for an hour.

11
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
- What are you doing here?- I came to ask you a big favor.

12
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
Don't tell me you want to keepmore stuff in my uterus.

13
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
Okay. Now, see.

14
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.

15
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
And Frank wants to nameone of the boy babies...

16
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
...Frank Jr., Jr.

17
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
Wouldn't that be Frank III?

18
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
Don't get me started.

19
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
Anyway, since thereare three babies...

20
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
...and we both gotto put our names in...

21
00:01:07 --> 00:01:11
...we would be truly honoredif you would name the other boy baby.

22
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
That's so nice!

23
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
Cougar.

24
00:01:16 --> 00:01:18
Think about it.

25
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
The One with Rachel's New Dress

26
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
I left a bra drying in there.

27
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
Will your son think it's yoursand be traumatized?

28
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
Mommy can have a wife.Daddy can have a bra.

29
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
It's time to go.

30
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
See, that clock's a little fast.

31
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
We still have 17 minutes.

32
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
What can we do in 17 minutes...

33
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
...twice?

34
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
Well, that's ambitious.

35
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
You can ignore that.

36
00:02:23 --> 00:02:23
That's your son.

37
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
Believe me, when he's older,he'll understand.

38
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
I'll be right there.

39
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
This is Carol and Susan.

40
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
- It's so nice to finally meet you.- You too.

41
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
- Susan will be in London next week.- I've never been there.

42
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
- I'll show you around.- Great!

43
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.Any suggestions?

44
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
There's tons of terrific stuff.

45
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
I'll go with you.

46
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Look at you two bonding.

47
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
Making us late for the airport.

48
00:02:58 --> 00:02:58
Are you all right?

49
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
It's just us getting alongis difficult for him...

50
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
...because he doesn't like me.

51
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
Come on. That's...

52
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
It's true.

53
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
Do we have a baby name yet?

54
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
No. It's so hard!

55
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
I went through this bookand found nothing.

56
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
I want a name that'sreally strong and confident.

57
00:03:20 --> 00:03:20
You know? Like...

58
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
...Exxon!

59
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
It certainly workedfor that Valdez kid.

60
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
You want a strong name?How about The Hulk?

61
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
I'm not sure about Hulk,but I like a name starting with "The".

62
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
You want a good name,go with Joey.

63
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
Joey's your pal, your buddy.

64
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
Where is everybody?They're hanging out with Joey!

65
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
If you're going to name him Joey,you should name him Chandler.

66
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
Chandler's funny, sophisticated,and very lovable...

67
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
...once you get to know him.

68
00:03:51 --> 00:03:52
Joey's lovable too.

69
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
But with Joey, if you need him,he'll be there.

70
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
Chandler will be there too.He might be a little late...

71
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
...but he'll be there.And he'll bring you cold soda...

72
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
...if what you need him foris that you're really hot.

73
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
What do you say?

74
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
I like the idea of naming himafter someone I love.

75
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
Joey and Chandlerare both great names.

76
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
All right, I don't...

77
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
Maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.

78
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
I shouldn't have mentioned it.I wanted to name my kid that.

79
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
If you hoped to sleep with Joshua,which one would you wear?

80
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
It creeps me out choosingother people's sex clothes.

81
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited.

82
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
I've been waiting for months.I got my hair colored.

83
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
I got new sheets.I'm making him a very fancy meal.

84
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
What am I making him, by the way?

85
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
A frisÃ©e saladwith goat cheese and pine nuts...

86
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
...wild rice, roasted asparagusand salmon en croute.

87
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
I thought I was making himfilet mignon.

88
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
You decided to make salmonbecause you had some left over.

89
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
Then you realized if you bitched,then you would stop cooking...

90
00:05:01 --> 00:05:05
...and you would have to make yourfamous baked potato and Diet Coke.

91
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
I really get crabby when I cook.

92
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
So Emily called last night.

93
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
And now you're giving me the message?

94
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
Turns out that Emily isjust crazy about Susan.

95
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
They're goingto the theater together.

96
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
They're going to dinner.

97
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
They're going horseback riding!

98
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
God, Susan is so fun!

99
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Look, this is justa little too familiar.

100
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
For six monthsbefore Carol and I split up...

101
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
...all I heard was,"My friend Susan is so smart."

102
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
"My friend Susan is so funny.My friend Susan is so great."

103
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
You think something could happenbetween Emily and Susan?

104
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
Hey, they're goingto the gym together!

105
00:05:52 --> 00:05:53
Two women...

106
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
...stretching!

107
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
They take a steam, things get playful.Didn't you see "Personal Best"?

108
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
No, but I'm gonna!

109
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
Hi! You're crazy.

110
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
Emily is straight.

111
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
How do you know?We thought Carol was straight.

112
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
Yeah, definitely.I don't like the name Ross.

113
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
What a weird way to kick mewhen I'm down!

114
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
No, I meant for the baby.

115
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
What's wrong with Ross?

116
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
Something like this would neverhappen to The Hulk, you know.

117
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
That's not true.

118
00:06:31 --> 00:06:36
In "The Incredible Hulk", number 72,Dr. Bruce Banner found...

119
00:06:36 --> 00:06:37
You know...

120
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
Never mind.My girlfriend's a lesbian.

121
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
I'm definitely going to gowith either Joey or Chandler.

122
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
You gotta pick Joey!

123
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
Name one famous personnamed Chandler.

124
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
Raymond Chandler.

125
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
Someone you didn't make up.

126
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
There are no famous Joeys.Except for...

127
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
...Joey Buttafucco.

128
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.

129
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
How about a compromise then?What if it's...

130
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
...Chan-no-ey?

131
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
Joey? Think about it.He'll never be President.

132
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
There will never be a President Joey.

133
00:07:11 --> 00:07:12
I didn't want to bring this up.

134
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
Chandler is the stupidest nameI've heard in my life!

135
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
It's not a name!It's barely even a word.

136
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
It's like chandelierbut it's not!

137
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
It's a stupid, stupid, non-name!

138
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
You're right.I have a horrible, horrible name.

139
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

140
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
So I guess it's Joey then.

141
00:07:47 --> 00:07:50
This is so nice.Thank you for doing this.

142
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
Please! Cooking soothes me.

143
00:07:56 --> 00:07:57
So dig in!

144
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
It all looks so good.

145
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
Oh, my God.

146
00:08:03 --> 00:08:05
I know.My God, this rice is so...

147
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
I am so good!

148
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
Behind you.

149
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
They used to live here,and sometimes they migrate back over.

150
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
Is there some waythat they could not be here?

151
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
Farm birds reallykind of freak me out!

152
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
Here we go.

153
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
There you go!

154
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
Hey! How'd you do that?

155
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
All gone.

156
00:08:43 --> 00:08:44
So, farm birds, huh?

157
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
It's my only weird thing, I swear.

158
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
I would have told you.I didn't know that they'd be here.

159
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Can I serve you a little...

160
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
What?

161
00:08:59 --> 00:09:00
Nothing.

162
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
It's just that I knowthat they're still out there.

163
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
They're across the hall.That's two doors away.

164
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
It'll take them a long timeto peck their way back over here.

165
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
That's not funny.

166
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
Would you feel betterif we went someplace else?

167
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
We could pack this stuff upand go to your apartment.

168
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
They're working on it.It's a mess.

169
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
I'm staying at my parents' house.We could go there.

170
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
They're out of town.

171
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
It's a huge place,and it's got this gorgeous view.

172
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
It'd be very romantic.

173
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
- What do you say?- Yeah, that works.

174
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
They can smell the fear.

175
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
How's Ben?

176
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
I asked if he wanted to eat.He said no.

177
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
I asked if he wanted to sleep.He said no.

178
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
I asked what he wanted to do.He said no.

179
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
So he's sweeping.

180
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
Any word from Susan?

181
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
She said she's havingso much fun with Emily.

182
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
By the by, did itever occur to you that...

183
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
...maybe they might be havinga little too much fun?

184
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
What's too much fun?

185
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
The kind of fun you and Susan hadwhen we were married.

186
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
Oh, my God!You are so paranoid.

187
00:10:17 --> 00:10:18
Am I?

188
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
Am I?

189
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
Susan is in a loving,committed relationship.

190
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
Carol, so were we.

191
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
Just imagine for a moment...

192
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
...that Susan meets someone,and they hit it off.

193
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
They're coming back from the theater,and they stop at a pub for drinks.

194
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
They're laughing.

195
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
Someone innocentlytouches someone else.

196
00:10:40 --> 00:10:41
There's electricity.

197
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
It's new. It's exciting.

198
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
Are you saying there isn'tthe slightest possibility...

199
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
...of something happening?

200
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
- Maybe.- Oh, my God!

201
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
I didn't really believe ituntil you just said it!

202
00:10:56 --> 00:11:01
None of the other kids believed me,but I swear that duck pushed me.

203
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
This place is fabulous!

204
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
This is the downstairs living room.

205
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
There's two living rooms?

206
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
Growing up here, this placemust have been a real babe magnet.

207
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
It would have been,but my parents just moved here.

208
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
You should know this placeis a real babe magnet.

209
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
Want to make out?

210
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
Why don't I put the foodin the fridge...

211
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
...and we can eat it later?

212
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
That sounds like a plan.

213
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
Is there a placethat I could go freshen up?

214
00:11:29 --> 00:11:34
Just down the halland second door to your left.

215
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
- Hi, darling.- What are you doing here?

216
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
- We cut the trip short.- France sucks!

217
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
This may be a little weird,but I've got a date here.

218
00:11:45 --> 00:11:46
Say no more.

219
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
We'll grab some food, go upstairsand be out of your hair.

220
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
That'd be great.So you didn't get to Italy?

221
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
Yep. Sucks!

222
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
Hi, you!

223
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
Oh, my God!

224
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
I know. I can do more than cook.

225
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
I like her. She seems smart.

226
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
Rachel, my parents.

227
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
So nice to meet you.

228
00:12:37 --> 00:12:42
Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

229
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
What, this? Oh, no.That's not what it is.

230
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
Okay, I work in fashion.

231
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
And this is a real dress, actually.

232
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
They're wearing it in Milan.

233
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
Part of my job is to wear the clothesand see how people respond.

234
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
Then I report back to my superiorsat Bloomingdale's.

235
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Obviously, in this case...

236
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
...I am going to report back:

237
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
"U.S.A. Not ready."

238
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
Maybe in L.A.

239
00:13:10 --> 00:13:11
There you go!

240
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
Have you kids eaten yet?

241
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
We were going to do that after.I mean, next.

242
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
Why don't we allget something to eat?

243
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
No use wasting this babyjust lying around the house.

244
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
So we'll go eat.

245
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
You'll wear that.

246
00:13:29 --> 00:13:33
We'll be eating and,of course, you'll be wearing that.

247
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
I am sorry about what I said.

248
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
Nope, you're right.It is a ridiculous name!

249
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
It's not bad.

250
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
Yes, it is!

251
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
From now on, I have no first name.

252
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
You're just Bing?

253
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
I have no name.

254
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
So what are we supposed to call you?

255
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
Okay, for now, temporarily,you can call me...

256
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
...Clint.

257
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
No way are you cool enoughto pull off "Clint".

258
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
What name am Icool enough to pull off?

259
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
Gene.

260
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
It's Clint.

261
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
It's Clint!

262
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
Bye, Gene.

263
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
It's Clint!

264
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
What's up with Gene?

265
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
You wore your nightie to dinner?

266
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
The best part was when the waiterspilled water down my back.

267
00:14:27 --> 00:14:31
I jumped up and my boob popped out.

268
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
It's all right.I got nice boobs.

269
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
I just picked upa message from Emily.

270
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
She and Susan are goingto a poetry reading together.

271
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
So?

272
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
Poetry?

273
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
Susan's gay.

274
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
They're being gay together!

275
00:14:48 --> 00:14:48
Emily's straight.

276
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
Oh, wake up!

277
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
Carol really messed you up.

278
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
Excuse me?

279
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
She turned you intothis untrusting, crazy, jealous...

280
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
...sycophant!

281
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
So I don't know what "sycophant" means,but the rest is right.

282
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
What are you talking about?I am not a crazy, jealous person.

283
00:15:13 --> 00:15:14
She's right.

284
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
When we were together, you got upsetabout Mark, and there was nothing.

285
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
This makes sense.

286
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
It does not!

287
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
In high school,you weren't jealous at all...

288
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
...even though all your girlfriendscheated on you.

289
00:15:26 --> 00:15:28
So up until '92, '93,he was very trusting.

290
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
Then '94 hit, Carol left him,and bam! Paranoid City!

291
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
Absolutely!

292
00:15:34 --> 00:15:35
This is so fun!

293
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
This is not fun!

294
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
All we're trying to say is...

295
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
...don't let what happened with Carolruin what you've got with Emily.

296
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
The '92 Ross wouldn't.

297
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
I still think I was rightabout that Mark thing.

298
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
Well, you know what?I hope Emily is a lesbian.

299
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
Drumroll.

300
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
All right.

301
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
Help!

302
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
Am I a Mark or a John?

303
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
You're not tall enough to be a Mark.

304
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
But you might make a good Barney.

305
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
Look, I am serious.

306
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm goingto the courthouse.

307
00:16:21 --> 00:16:22
You're going through with this?

308
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
This name has held me backmy entire life.

309
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
It's why kids picked on meand why I never do well with women.

310
00:16:28 --> 00:16:32
So tomorrow, I'll either beMark Johnson or John Markson.

311
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
You've got problems because of you,not your name!

312
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
This has got to stop!Chandler is a great name.

313
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
In fact...

314
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
I'm sorry, I know you wanted meto name the baby Joey.

315
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
I'm going to name the baby Chandler.

316
00:16:51 --> 00:16:52
Really?

317
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
But you have to keep the name too.

318
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
Okay, thanks!

319
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
You want to hug it out?

320
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
I'm going to go tellFrank and Alice right now!

321
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
Bye, Pheebs!

322
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
- Nice luggage.- I was going to say.

323
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
I missed you too.

324
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
- Thanks, I had a great time.- So did I.

325
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
No tongue.
