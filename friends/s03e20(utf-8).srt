1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,462
You're telling me
this actress person...

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:08,834
...is the only woman you ever wanted
who didn't want you back?

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,904
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,509
Is this what it's like to be you?

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,183
-You're crazy about her, huh?
-You have no idea.

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:22,377
When we're on stage, I get to
kiss her and touch her.

7
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,213
She goes home with the director...

8
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,358
...and it's like somebody's
ripping out my heart.

9
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:30,221
Oh, it's so great to see you
feeling like this.

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,832
Dad called this morning.

11
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,236
Aunt Sylvia passed away.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,740
We were all
pretty shaken up about it.

13
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,142
Am I missing something?

14
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,251
I thought death was supposed
to be sad, in a way.

15
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,482
Well, Aunt Sylvia was...

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,089
... not a nice person.

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,158
She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,527
And I'm sorry she died.

19
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,393
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

20
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,829
-You get the dollhouse.
-I get the dollhouse!

21
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,504
A house for dolls!
That is so cool.

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,076
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.

23
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,405
You had a barrel for a dollhouse?

24
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,878
No, just a barrel.

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,211
You know what? You can play
with my dollhouse.

26
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,319
Really?

27
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,885
Any time you want.

28
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,094
When I was young I wanted
to play with this dollhouse.

29
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,627
But no! It was to be looked at,
never played with.

30
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,332
My grandmother said
the same thing to me.

31
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,998
The One With the Doll House

32
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,153
Thanks for lunch.
You didn't have to walk me here.

33
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,153
That's okay. No problem.

34
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,522
You realize we don't keep
the women's lingerie here.

35
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,038
Yes, I realize that.

36
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,205
-Summer catalog.
-That's the stuff.

37
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,105
Rachel, I need the Versace invoice.

38
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,811
You don't work for me.

39
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,085
Joanna, this is my friend
Chandler Bing. Joanna.

40
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,877
Bing? That's a great name.

41
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,817
It's Gaelic for,
"Thy turkey's done."

42
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,626
-I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you.
-You too.

43
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,434
So what's wrong with him?

44
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:27,265
Nothing. He's just goofy like that.
I actually hardly notice it anymore.

45
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,801
I mean, is he married
or involved with anyone?

46
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,112
He's not married or involved
with anyone.

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,249
Actually, you know what?
Forget it.

48
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,957
-I'll ask him for you, if you want.
-Would you?

49
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,889
Or is it too sad and desperate,
like something Sophie would do?

50
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,461
-I am here.
-I know that.

51
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,025
Look at it!

52
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,068
Wallpaper's a little faded.
That's okay.

53
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,740
Carpet's a little loose.

54
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,375
Hardwood floors?!

55
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,375
-It's so beautiful!
-I know!

56
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,754
So I'm here, ready to play!

57
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:22,684
I brought a bunch of stuff
for the house, so check it out.

58
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,355
What's this?

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000
That's a dog.
Every house should have a dog.

60
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,367
Not one that can pee on the roof.

61
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:39,571
Maybe it's so big because the house
was built on radioactive waste.

62
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:45,045
And is this in case the house sneezes?

63
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,512
No, that's the ghost for the attic.

64
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,253
-I don't want a ghost.
-Well, nobody wants a ghost.

65
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,262
But you've got one...

66
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,560
... because the house is sitting on
an ancient lndian burial ground.

67
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,633
Wait a minute. The house
was built on radioactive waste...

68
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,206
...and an ancient
lndian burial ground?

69
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,809
That would never happen.

70
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,780
Obviously you don't know much
about the U.S. government.

71
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,956
-I need to talk to you.
-Sure. What's up?

72
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,590
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.

73
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,561
I know.

74
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,324
Well, if something comes up....

75
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,802
I'm glad you guys are past
that little awkward phase.

76
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,638
My boss. Joanna. When you left...

77
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,473
...she started asking questions
about you....

78
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,343
Liked what she saw?

79
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,747
Dug my action, did she?

80
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,981
Checking out the Chan Chan Man!

81
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,291
That was...

82
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,465
...surreal.

83
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,825
What do you think?
Are you interested?

84
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,468
She seemed cool. Attractive.
I'll do it.

85
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,200
Thank you, Chandler.
This is great. She's gonna love me.

86
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:21,174
Dinosaur attack!
Quick, everybody into the house!

87
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,610
All right, Phoebe, you know what?
That's it. That's it.

88
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,014
No dinosaurs, no ghosts,
no giant dogs, okay?

89
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,157
They're not the right size, they're
not Victorian and they don't go.

90
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,295
Fine.

91
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:43,496
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome
in the house of no imagination.

92
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:48,299
While we're on the subject,
I have to say that dinosaurs...

93
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,409
...they don't go, "ruff!"

94
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,708
The little ones do.

95
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,756
-Hey, Kate.
-Morning.

96
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,321
I went to that restaurant
you talked about

97
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,822
Hey, lovely.

98
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,358
Come, talk to me for a minute.

99
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,292
I ate the food. It was good.
I had the fish.

100
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,965
I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.

101
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,129
Joey Tribbiani.

102
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,504
I know.

103
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,506
I'm a big fan of yours.

104
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,734
What?

105
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,311
I used to schedule my classes
so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...

106
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,076
...on Days of our Lives.

107
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,084
-Get out of here. Really?
-Absolutely.

108
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,424
But then they dropped you
down that elevator shaft.

109
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,353
They gave me the shaft, all right.

110
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,222
You're so funny.

111
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,358
What are you doing after rehearsal?

112
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,535
You want to get a drink?

113
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,201
Sure. A drink sounds great.

114
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,471
-Cool. I'll see you then.
-All right.

115
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,418
All right. It's time to act,
my talking props.

116
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,159
Look everybody!
Look at my new dollhouse!

117
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,430
Look, look!

118
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,307
Hey, what's this?

119
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,412
It's a slide instead of stairs.
Look.

120
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,280
Very interesting, Phoebe.

121
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,249
What's this?

122
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:45,082
The licorice room.
You can eat all the furniture.

123
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,458
And when guests come over, they can
stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.

124
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,362
This is the coolest house ever!

125
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,534
Does anyone want to join me
in the Aroma Room?

126
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,465
-All right.
-I would.

127
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,697
Hey, guys? Guys!

128
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,204
Did you see my new china cabinet?

129
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,341
Watch. Watch.

130
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,280
And? And?

131
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,319
Hey, my father's house does that.

132
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,328
How did it go?
Tell me everything!

133
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,826
The movie was great...

134
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,729
...dinner was great, and there's nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening.

135
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,737
Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that
because Joanna's such a dull dud!

136
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,973
Chandler is fantastic!

137
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,211
-What?
-You know how people just click?

138
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,681
He came by to pick me up, I opened
the door and it was just like, "click!"

139
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,351
Did he tell you?

140
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,250
Doesn't he have a good heart?

141
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,358
And he's so sweet. He said he'd
call, so put him straight through.

142
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,653
-lsn't this great?
-Don't spoil it.

143
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,160
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?

144
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,733
What do you say?

145
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,498
It's you.
Just one sec.

146
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,009
I'm going to take this call.

147
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,410
When I continue,
I hope there will appear on-stage...

148
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:23,178
...this magical thing
that in the theater we call...

149
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,391
...committing to the moment!

150
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,928
The guy's like a cartoon.

151
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,631
What do you see in him, anyway?

152
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,301
He happens to be brilliant.

153
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,596
Which is more than I can say
for that sweater you're dating.

154
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,570
I'm not interested in her sweater.

155
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,971
It's what's underneath her sweater
that counts.

156
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,116
And besides...

157
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,113
...since when do you care
who I'm with?

158
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,253
I don't care.
Why, do you want me to care?

159
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,823
Do you want me to want you to care?

160
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,726
Do you?

161
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,229
What?

162
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,597
Okay. I'm afraid to say this,
but let's pick up where we left off.

163
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,301
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?

164
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,979
I've got no reason to stay.

165
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,809
Stop!

166
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,646
Stop it! You must stop!

167
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,153
You are bad actors!

168
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,962
This is a terrible play!

169
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,495
I'll see you in the morning.

170
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,299
I can't believe we go on
in a week.

171
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,038
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

172
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,775
Since we're getting off early,
do you want to go paint mugs?

173
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,941
What?

174
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,951
At the place I told you about
last night?

175
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,216
Yeah, with the mug-painting.

176
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,788
I was so listening to that.

177
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,862
But you know what?
I need to work on my stuff tonight.

178
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,661
I'll see you tomorrow.

179
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,637
Are you okay?

180
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,315
I guess.

181
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,485
What are we gonna do about the scene?

182
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,914
I don't know.

183
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,389
Maybe if it had more heat.

184
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,696
Well, how do you mean?

185
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,763
Adrianne's looking for a reason
to stay, right?

186
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,993
Victor can't just kiss her.
He's gotta...

187
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,603
... he's gotta give her a reason.

188
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,599
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

189
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,243
Or maybe...

190
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:09,420
... maybe he could grab her
and lift her up.

191
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,254
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs
around his waist.

192
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,620
Then she could rip off his shirt and
kiss his chest and stomach.

193
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:22,027
Then he could use his teeth
to undo her dress and...

194
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,132
...and bite her!

195
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,527
Then right when the scene ends,
he could take her...

196
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,571
...with this raw, animal....

197
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,210
Something like that?

198
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,041
That's pretty much
what I had in mind.

199
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,309
It's a little early to be drinking.

200
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,407
Things finally happened with Kate.

201
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,514
You're kidding? That's great.

202
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,048
It was so amazing.

203
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,615
After the lovemaking...

204
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,754
Oh, my.

205
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,821
... I just watched her sleep for hours.

206
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,495
Just breathing in...

207
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,561
...and breathing out.

208
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,858
I knew she was dreaming because...

209
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,399
... her eyes kept going like this.

210
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,837
I'm telling you,
she's got it all wrong.

211
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,537
All I said was, "This was fun.
Let's do it again sometime.

212
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,009
I'll give you a call."

213
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,753
I wonder why she thinks you're going
to call her?

214
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,421
It's what you say at the end
of a date.

215
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,456
You can't just say,
"Nice to meet you. Good night?"

216
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,292
To her face?

217
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,992
I'm standing there...

218
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,565
...she's waiting for me to say
I'll call her...

219
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,100
...and it comes out.
I can't help it.

220
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,329
It's a compulsion.

221
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:13,807
When a guy says he'll call,
it doesn't mean he's going to call.

222
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,147
This never happened to you?

223
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,315
Well, they always called.

224
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,813
Bite me.

225
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,488
-Did he call?
-No, sorry.

226
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,959
Why? He said he'd call.
Why hasn't he called?

227
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,294
Maybe he's intimidated by smart,
strong, successful women.

228
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,433
Sophie, will you please
climb out of my butt.

229
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,673
Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?

230
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,206
Maybe he feels awkward because
you're my boss.

231
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,441
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?

232
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,211
You didn't tell him
not to call me, did you?

233
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,449
If you're uncomfortable with
your friend dating me...

234
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,183
...there are always ways to fix that.

235
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,656
Call her. Call her now!

236
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,696
Multiple so many paper cuts.

237
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,932
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why, why? I don't understand!"

238
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,509
I'm telling you, she's flipped out!
She's gone crazy!

239
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,572
Well, give me the phone then.

240
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,845
She thinks it's my fault
you haven't called her.

241
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,383
You have to call her.

242
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,713
You can't call somebody
after this long to say:

243
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,221
"In case you didn't notice,
I don't like you."

244
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,425
Then you'll have to
take her out again.

245
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,421
She's really dull,
and she gets this...

246
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,828
...gross mascara-goop thing
in the corner of her eye!

247
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,329
I don't care!

248
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,506
You'll take her out again
and end it...

249
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,107
...in a way she knows it's ended.

250
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,176
I don't care how hard it is.
Don't tell her you'll call her again!

251
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,411
All right, fine!

252
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,879
But just lunch.
From now on, I get my own dates.

253
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,246
I don't want you setting me up again!

254
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,453
That's fine!

255
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,585
-That's just a lot of big talk.
-I know.

256
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,422
I'm in the shower!

257
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,936
Fire! There's a fire! Fire!

258
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:07,250
I talked to Lauren.
I told her how things were with us.

259
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,146
Did you talk to Marshall?

260
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,414
About what?

261
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,022
About what happened with us.

262
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:21,193
No, there's really no reason
why he should find out.

263
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,163
So let's not make a big deal
out of it, okay?

264
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,867
What are you talking about?

265
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,301
It was a big deal.

266
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,646
You can't tell me last night
didn't mean something to you.

267
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,180
I was there.
You're not that good an actress.

268
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,517
I was just caught up in the moment.

269
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,484
That's all it was.

270
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,425
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but...

271
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,597
... haven't you slept with a woman
and it meant more to her than to you?

272
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,067
Hi, pig!

273
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,943
Sorry I scared you in there.

274
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,840
It's okay.

275
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,807
By the way...

276
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,179
... I was just checking
the shower massager.

277
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,560
I tried to reach you at work.

278
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,161
There's been a fire.

279
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,958
What?
Oh, my God!

280
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,393
What happened?

281
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,400
We believe it originated here...

282
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,566
...in the Aroma Room.

283
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,678
Did everyone get out okay?

284
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,145
The giraffe's okay,
and so is the pirate.

285
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,884
-What's this?
-No, don't look!

286
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,178
You don't want to see
what's under there!

287
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,159
The foster puppets!

288
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:03,228
It's not a big deal. It's right
here, and it's all the time.

289
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,430
Thanks again for lunch.

290
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,871
-This was pleasant.
-lt was, wasn't it?

291
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,111
-The food there was great.
-Wasn't it?

292
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,583
So take care.

293
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,279
You too.

294
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,256
I'll give you a call.
We should do it again!

295
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,928
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

296
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,756
-Any messages?
-Sophie's desk.

297
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,698
Are you gonna call her?

298
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,372
I'm sorry, okay? I'm weak
and pathetic and sorry.

299
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,103
You are gonna tell her.
You'll tell her now.

300
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,111
I'm not gonna call you.

301
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,549
What?

302
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,888
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:01,819
I'm sorry I said I was going to
when I'm not.

304
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,894
This has nothing to do with you.

305
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,497
And this isn't Rachel's fault.
It's me.

306
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,792
I have serious problems
when it comes to women.

307
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:15,167
I have issues with commitment,
intimacy...

308
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,298
... mascara goop.

309
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,906
I'm really sorry. It's just that...

310
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,809
...this isn't going to work out.

311
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,248
This isn't how I was hoping
this would end...

312
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,790
... but I guess I have to appreciate
your honesty.

313
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,869
I'll give you a call.
We should do it again sometime!

314
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,375
Anyway, Beth,
what I'm saying is...

315
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:01,551
... I should have considered your
feelings before I went home with you.

316
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,381
I've recently learned what it's like
to be on your side...

00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,353
...and I'm sorry.

318
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,156
Do you think you can forgive me?

319
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,165
Great. Thanks.

Hello, Jennifer?

321
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,040
Hi, Mrs. Laurio.
Is Jennifer there?

322
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,647
She's not home, huh?

323
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,052
Actually I kind of need
to talk to you too.
