1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
Okay, guys, listen.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
So try to really keepRoss' mind off of it.

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
Good idea.

5
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
Hey, man. What's up?

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
Just thinking about Emilygetting married tomorrow.

7
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
Oh, Ross! Look, look!

8
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
What? Where?

9
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
Right over there! There!Look, look, look!

10
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
- What am I looking at?- Somebody help me out here.

11
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
Hey!

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
Monica, sorry I didn't come by.I was out with Gary.

13
00:00:31 --> 00:00:35
He let me ride around with him.We saw and prevented crimes.

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
You got to go on a ride-along?

15
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
- I want to go on a ride-along!- Me too!

16
00:00:39 --> 00:00:40
- Okay.- Yeah! Me too!

17
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
Really? You?

18
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
Yeah.

19
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
- Well, it's kind of dangerous.- Well, I like danger.

20
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
- Okay, you guys free tonight?- Yeah!

21
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
You didn't sayit was gonna be at nighttime.

22
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
The One with the Ride-Along

23
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
I'm glad you're home.We can finally organize these photos.

24
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
Oh, thank God!

25
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
Finally!

26
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
I've broken them downinto categories.

27
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
We got holidays,birthdays, candids...

28
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
And I've cross-referencedthem by subject.

29
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
So if you're looking up, say...

30
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
...birthdays and dogs,you get photo 152.

31
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
See?

32
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
Oh, it's me and LePoo.

33
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
Wow, I miss that dog.

34
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
You can also find himunder "dog" and "dead".

35
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
Great. Thanks.

36
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
Hand me that other box of photos.That's the last one.

37
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
Oops.

38
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
Sorry.

39
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
Good thing you numbered them.

40
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
I hadn't.

41
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
Photo 152 was a prototype.

42
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.

43
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
How about I fix you a drink?Maybe a margarita?

44
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
Ross has the blender.

45
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
Everything's just falling apart.

46
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
It's okay. I'll go to Ross',get the blender.

47
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
- You get the margarita stuff ready.- All right.

48
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
His keys are in the drawer.Also, I need some cash.

49
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
Want me to stop at the ATM?

50
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
No. While you're at Ross',if you see any lying around.

51
00:02:45 --> 00:02:46
What?

52
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
I don't do that.

53
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
That was so cool, man.The way you leaned on that guy.

54
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
It is starting to get dark out there.

55
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
He told you everything.You cracked him.

56
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
He was the victim.They're usually pretty talkative.

57
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.

58
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
- Want me to grab the berry?- It's called a cherry.

59
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
It's called...Chandler!

60
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
Okay, I got it.

61
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
This place makes thebest sandwich in the world.

62
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
Does it have meatballs?

63
00:03:26 --> 00:03:26
Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?

65
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
Yep.

66
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
You can't eat that in my car.

67
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
Yeah, okay.

68
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
Even though my tax dollarspaid for this car.

69
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
Your tax dollars?

70
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
Yeah, okay.

71
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
Wow, that sandwich smells good.

72
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
Did I say you could smell it?

73
00:03:52 --> 00:03:53
I can't smell it?

74
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
Half the taste is in the smell.You're sucking up all the taste units.

75
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
Okay, I'll give them back.

76
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
What is so great about that sandwich?

77
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
Imagine the best sex you ever had.

78
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
- Are you thinking about Monica?- Yeah.

79
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
What's that like?

80
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.Please, please.

81
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
Please, please.

82
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
"Made in Mexico."Yes!

83
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
Who would buy this?

84
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
Rach, it's me. Pick up!

85
00:04:41 --> 00:04:42
What's up?

86
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
I need more margarita things.

87
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
I need some salt,some margarita mix and tequila.

88
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
So all we had was ice?

89
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
See if he has ice.

90
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
Hello, Ross?

91
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
It's Emily here.

92
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
but I'm getting married tomorrow.

93
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
Well, maybe I am...

94
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
I keep thinking about you.

95
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
a mistake giving up so fast.

96
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
Are you thinking about me?

97
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
But if you are, call me tonight.

98
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
Okay, bye.

99
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
Where we going?

100
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
This witness won't return my calls.We'll surprise him coming home.

101
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
Surprise him? We're not gonnamake anybody mad, are we?

102
00:05:36 --> 00:05:37
Come on, man.

103
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoesa bit before he lawyers up?

104
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
He's a witness, not a perp.And no one talks like that.

105
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
Yeah. No one talks like that.

106
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
- Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?- I'm more cop than you two.

107
00:05:50 --> 00:05:51
How do you figure that?

108
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
I'm in the front seat, okay?

109
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
I'm Gary's partner.

110
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
When you say "partner",it doesn't sound cop.

111
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
It sounds gay.

112
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
Jealous.

113
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
- Hey, we're undercover here.- Oh, yeah. No problem.

114
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
- Ross!- Sorry.

115
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
There.

116
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Hey, Gary. Who am I?

117
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
Phone home.

118
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
Look at Officer Ross ridingback here with the visitors.

119
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
What's up with that, Serpico?

120
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
No, of course you're not.

121
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
But if you are, call me tonight.

122
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Okay, bye.

123
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
No.

124
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
I know!

125
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
Thank God, you were here.We have to erase that.

126
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
What? We can't do that.

127
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
We have to.What if Ross hears that...

128
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
...and calls her andthey get back together?

129
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
Is that what you want?Ross back with that controlling...

130
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
...neurotic, crazy Emilywho wouldn't let him see you?

131
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
No! Oh, no, no.

132
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
God, no! He should notget back with her.

133
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
I know that, you know that.Even Ross knows that.

134
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
But we have no rightto erase his message.

135
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
Look, I'm his sister and I love him.I don't want to see him get hurt.

136
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
Doesn't that give methe right to control...

137
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
Help him?

138
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
He's not the one who needs help.

139
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
She's obviously unstable.

140
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
She's thinking about runningout on her wedding day.

141
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
Okay, fine. But look at theposition she's putting him in.

142
00:07:25 --> 00:07:26
And what's he gonna do?

143
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
Break up their marriageon their wedding day?

144
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
Who would do that?

145
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
Okay, fine. All right.But that was different.

146
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Although it did involvea lot of the same people.

147
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
This is some twisted jokeshe's playing on him.

148
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
You are crazy.She sounded genuinely upset.

149
00:07:45 --> 00:07:46
I mean, listen.

150
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
Your messages have been erased.

151
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
No!

152
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
Okay, but we're safe, right?Nothing bad's gonna go down.

153
00:07:56 --> 00:07:57
No. But that reminds me.Sign this.

154
00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
What is it?

155
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
It says you can't sueif you scrape your knee...

156
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
...or get your head blown off.

157
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.

158
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
Here he comes.

159
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
What is he doing?What the hell is he doing?

160
00:08:11 --> 00:08:11
What is it?

161
00:08:12 --> 00:08:13
- Is everything okay?- What?

162
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
He sees us. Don't move.And don't look at him!

163
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
Hey, it's okay.It was just a car backfire.

164
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
Hey, look at that.You tried to save your buddy.

165
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
You see that?

166
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
You see what he did?

167
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
You okay, man?

168
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
Thanks, Joey.

169
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
Hello?

170
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
We should go.

171
00:08:55 --> 00:08:56
No, wait.

172
00:08:56 --> 00:08:57
Oh, yeah. Right.

173
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
No. Monica.

174
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
Monica, we have to fix this.

175
00:09:01 --> 00:09:02
What can we do?You erased the message.

176
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
Unless we tell him.

177
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
If you want to be rational,I can't argue with you.

178
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
All right?

179
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
Fine, tell him. I just don'twant to be a part of it.

180
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
Maybe that's Emily leavingthe exact same message.

181
00:09:16 --> 00:09:20
want you to remember this feeling.

182
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
You are lucky to be alive.

183
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
So live every day to the fullest.

184
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
Love yourself, okay?

185
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
And also get stamps. Bye.

186
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
Play that message for Emily,and this problem goes away.

187
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
Right?

188
00:09:36 --> 00:09:37
Anybody want to meet a hero?

189
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
John Glenn is here?

190
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
No. Joey.

191
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
We had the most incredible night.

192
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
- We're in the car...- Wait. Hold on.

193
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
Hi.

194
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
Okay, go ahead.

195
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
So we're in the car, and bang!A shot was fired.

196
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
And Joey, with no regardfor his own safety...

197
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
...throws himself on me.

198
00:09:58 --> 00:09:59
My God!

199
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
It was a car backfire.

200
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
But he didn't know that.

201
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
Yeah, I didn't know that.

202
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
It could just as easilyhave been a bullet.

203
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
Ever think about joining the force?We could use a guy like you.

204
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
Who jumps at loud noises.

205
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
Wow. I could have died tonight.

206
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
If the car that backfiredhad run over you!

207
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
I'm going before he starts ramblingabout his newfound respect for life.

208
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
I do have a newfound respect for life.

209
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
Oh, my God!

210
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
- You want to get some dinner?- Yeah, sure.

211
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
You know what? If I heard a shotright now, I'd throw my body on you.

212
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
Maybe we should walkin a bad neighborhood.

213
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
Okay.

214
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
Bye.

215
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
Cut it out.

216
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
I'd hate to save your lifeand kick your ass on the same day.

217
00:11:00 --> 00:11:01
Why'd you take off?

218
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
Just going for a walk.

219
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
Around the living room, whatever.

220
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
- Is something wrong?- No. No, I'm just tired.

221
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
You know, from the walk.

222
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
You dove in front of Ross!

223
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
Ross!

224
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
That's what this is about.

225
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
Oh, my God. You hate Ross!

226
00:11:23 --> 00:11:24
I don't hate Ross.

227
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
Of course, you do. I saved him.You're mad at me. It adds up.

228
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
You want Ross out of the picture.

229
00:11:30 --> 00:11:31
What picture?

230
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
I don't know.But I don't like what I'm hearing.

231
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
I'm glad you saved Ross.But it could've been a bullet.

232
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
And you didn't try to save me.

233
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
You're upset because you thinkI chose Ross over you.

234
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
No, I knew you couldtake care of yourself.

235
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
You know? I mean, Ross needs help.He's not "street" like us.

236
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
You'd risk your life for Rossbefore you would for me.

237
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
That's the bottom line.

238
00:11:56 --> 00:11:57
No, not exactly.

239
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
All right, look.

240
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
I wasn't trying to save Ross.

241
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
Okay?

242
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
My sandwich was next to Ross.

243
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
All right?

244
00:12:09 --> 00:12:13
I was trying to save my sandwich.

245
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
From a bullet?

246
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
- I know it doesn't make much sense.- "Much" sense?

247
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
Look, it was instinct!I just went for it.

248
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
You risked your life for a sandwich?

249
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
I know it sounds crazy...

250
00:12:25 --> 00:12:29
...but this is the greatestsandwich in the world!

251
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
So you didn't choose Ross before me?

252
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
No. I would never do that.

253
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
You're like my brother.

254
00:12:37 --> 00:12:38
- Really?- Yeah.

255
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
In fact, to prove how muchyou mean to me...

256
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
Here.

257
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
- Thanks.- Easy, it's not a hot dog!

258
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
How good is that?

259
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
See?

260
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
What are you doing?

261
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
You're showing me how muchI mean to you.

262
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
With a bite.

263
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
Jeez!

264
00:13:22 --> 00:13:23
What are you doing here?

265
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
Hey, you know what?

266
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
You are in our apartmentall the time!

267
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
This is just a dropin the bucket, mister!

268
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
It doesn't matter. The importantthing is that you're here.

269
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
You're my friend and you're here.

270
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
Okay, just a little scared.What's going on?

271
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
The most amazing thinghappened tonight.

272
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
I thought my number was up.

273
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
I had an actual near-death experience.

274
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
What happened?

275
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
We were on the ride-along with Garyand somebody took a shot at me!

276
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
Really?

277
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
No. A car backfired.

278
00:14:01 --> 00:14:05
But I thought somebody was takinga shot at me. And, Rach...

279
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
...I survived!

280
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
And I was filled withthis great respect for life.

281
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
I want to experience every moment.

282
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
I want to seize every opportunity.

283
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
I am seeing everything so clearly now.

284
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
Because a car backfired?

285
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
Okay. Why are you here?

286
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
I don't know how this fitsinto your whole seizing thing...

287
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
...but Emily called you today.

288
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
- You talked to her?- She left a message.

289
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
But it kind of got erased.

290
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
I mean, there's somethingwrong with your machine.

291
00:14:37 --> 00:14:38
What did she say?

292
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
Something about having secondthoughts about the wedding.

293
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
And did you guys makea mistake breaking up?

294
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
And she wants you to call her.

295
00:14:47 --> 00:14:48
Wow.

296
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
That was a good thingthat I told you, right?

297
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

298
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
Okay, thank you. Thank you.Because...

299
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
I'm gonna tell Monica I was right.

300
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
Because she didn't want...

301
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
Not important. Point is,I was right. Your decision.

302
00:15:03 --> 00:15:03
Okay?

303
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
I was right.

304
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
Your decision.

305
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
Right.

306
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
I guess I should call Emily.

307
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
No, that's not the right decision.

308
00:15:12 --> 00:15:13
That's not right.

309
00:15:13 --> 00:15:14
Ross, come on!

310
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
I mean...

311
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
...that woman made you miserable!

312
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
Do you really wantto get back into that?

313
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
Okay, look. Yesterday...

314
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
...I wouldn't have evenconsidered calling her back.

315
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
But my ex-wife callson the same day...

316
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
...I have a near-death experience?

317
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
That's gotta mean something.

318
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
That was not a near-death experience.That was barely an experience.

319
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
You weren't there!

320
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
Maybe this is something thatI'm supposed to seize, you know?

321
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
Okay. You know what?

322
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.

323
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.

324
00:15:52 --> 00:15:53
Okay? Look at today.

325
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
I mean, you escaped...

326
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
...death.

327
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
And maybe this is a chancefor you to escape...

328
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
...getting back together with Emily.

329
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
That does make sense.

330
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
Because I do want to seizesome opportunity...

331
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
...but I really don't wantto see or talk to her.

332
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
Well, there you go!

333
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
Yeah, maybe today's just...

334
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
...close-call day.

335
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
Hey, thanks, Rach.

336
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
Oh, honey. No problem.

337
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
Wait, wait.The message is blinking.

338
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
Maybe you didn't erase it.

339
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
Hey, Ross, it's you...

340
00:16:32 --> 00:16:37
That's an old message.Nobody needs to hear that.

341
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
Hey, was Monica here?

342
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
I want my money back.

343
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
You probably need thatfor stamps, right?

344
00:16:51 --> 00:16:52
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?

345
00:16:53 --> 00:16:54
Yes, once.

346
00:16:54 --> 00:16:55
A little.

347
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
He kind of did it to himself.

348
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
It's not really a good story.

349
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
I wonder how I'd react under fire.And not backfire...

350
00:17:03 --> 00:17:04
...but heavy fire.

351
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
Like, if I was in a war.

352
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
Man, I would be great in a war!

353
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
I think I'd makea fantastic military leader.

354
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
I mean, I know I'd make generalbefore any of you guys.

355
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
Before or after you were shotby your own troops?

356
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
I know Joey would be in the foxholeprotecting all of us.

357
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
If the foxhole waslined with sandwiches.

358
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
Yeah, hero sandwiches.

359
00:17:27 --> 00:17:31
You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'mnot interested in war in any way.

360
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
But when the revolution comes,I'll have to destroy you all.

361
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
Not you, Joey.
