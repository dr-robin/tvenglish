00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
Hey, Ross.

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
I'm so glad someone's here.Could you zip me up?

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
- Sure.- Thank you.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Can you believe no onebetween my apartment and here...

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
...offered to do that for me?

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
People.

7
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
So why are you so dressed up?

8
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
Mike's picking me up for a date.

9
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
How's that going?Is it getting serious?

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
I don't know. I don't know.I mean, I like him.

11
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
But am I ready to takemy Grade A loins off the meat market?

12
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
I'm not quite sure.

13
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
You know, I really admireyour whole dating attitude.

14
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
It's so healthy. I'm always like,"Is this moving too fast?

15
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
Is this moving too slow?Where's this going?"

16
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
I know.You are a bit of a drama queen.

17
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
You're so much better off. You justgo from guy to guy having fun...

18
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
...and not worrying that itnever turns into anything serious.

19
00:00:49 --> 00:00:51
I wouldn't say "never."

20
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
You know, there is that guy.

21
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
Okay, well, what about...?

22
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
Okay, there's gotta be someone.

23
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
- There isn't! That's what I'm saying.- Oh, my God, you're right!

24
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
I know. And yet, here you are,all ready for the next date.

25
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
I can't believe I neverrealized this before.

26
00:01:08 --> 00:01:12
I'm in my 30s, and I've never beenin a long-term relationship.

27
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?

28
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
There's nothing wrong with you.

29
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
I mean, you don't strike me as the typeof person that wants to get married.

30
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
I want to get married!

31
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
No, please...Please don't cry because of me.

32
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
I don't know what I'm talking about,okay? I've been divorced three times.

33
00:01:31 --> 00:01:32
At least you've been married.

34
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
Oh, my God!I want to trade lives with Ross?!

35
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
Phoebe.

36
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
- What's wrong?- Nothing. I'm excited about our date.

37
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
Mike, this is Ross Geller.Ross, this is Mike...

38
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
- Sorry, I didn't catch that.- Mike Hanigan.

39
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
- Ross Geller.- Hey.

40
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
So are you sure you're ready to go?

41
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
How do I look?

42
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
- Do you have a compact in your purse?- No.

43
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
You look great.

47
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
- Hey, Joey.- This girl won't turn around.

48
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
I can't tell if she's hot or not.What do you think?

49
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
Joey, I am not goingto objectify women with you.

50
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
But if her face isas nice as her ass...

51
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
- Mama!- All right. Thanks.

52
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
- Have you talked to Chandler?- He has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.

53
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
- How come?- I don't know. He has to work.

54
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
There's some big rush on the...

55
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
Damn it. I'm gonna have to startlistening when he talks about his job.

56
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
Why don't you fly out thereand surprise him?

57
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
Maybe I will go.

58
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
We'll have a little second honeymoonat the Tulsa Ramada.

59
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
You should bring your black see-throughteddy with the attached garters.

60
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
- How do you know I have one of those?- Didn't until just now.

61
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
Hot. Not hot.

62
00:03:27 --> 00:03:28
Hot!

63
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
Excuse me?

64
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
I said that I think you're hot.

65
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
And... now I'm embarrassed.

66
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
I thought you said "hi."

67
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
That would've been better.

68
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
I'll try that. Hi, I'm Joey.

69
00:03:44 --> 00:03:45
I'm Hayley.

70
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
Look, I don't normally ask out womenthat I meet in coffeehouses.

71
00:03:53 --> 00:03:54
Gesundheit.

72
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
- But...- I would love to go out with you.

73
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
Really? Great.

74
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
Did l...?Did I actually ask you?

75
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
That's just where you were going.I figured I'd help you out.

76
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
You don't seem like the kind of guywho does this a lot?

77
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
You should see someoneabout that cold.

78
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
If it gets much worse, you could die.

79
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
- So how'd the date go?- Well, it was awful.

80
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
Every time I thought aboutwhat you said, I cried.

81
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
- So he hasn't called?- Would you call this girl:

82
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
"Thanks for... a lovely... evening"?

83
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
Now I feel terrible.This is all my fault.

84
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
You know what you shouldfeel terrible about?

85
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
This could have been my serious guy.

86
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
He was sweet and smart and funny.

87
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
You know how hard it isto meet a guy like that?

88
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
We are a rare breed.

89
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
What a great dinner.

90
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
Thanks again for letting me have thatlast piece of cake at the restaurant.

91
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
You're welcome again.I'm gonna go make some coffee.

92
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
- Can I get you anything?- Do you have any cake?

93
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
So this is going pretty good.

94
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
We've got a lot in common.

95
00:05:08 --> 00:05:09
Victoria 's Secret.

96
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
We even like the same books.

97
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
There's a scary painting.

98
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
Wait a minute.

99
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
by that painting before.

100
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
This whole place looks familiar.

101
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
in this apartment.

102
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
this weird plant before.

103
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
It did that the last time!

104
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
I've gone out with this girl before.

105
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Yeah! We had sex on this couch!

106
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
No.

107
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
"No", "we didn 't do it here..."

108
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
like a perfectly good place.

109
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
That's why.

110
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
Hey, Mike. Sorry to just drop bylike this. Can I come in?

111
00:05:53 --> 00:05:54
Sure.

112
00:05:55 --> 00:05:56
Who are you?

113
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
I'm Ross. Phoebe's friendfrom the coffeehouse?

114
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
I really, really need to talkto you about something.

115
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Unless...

116
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
You're not gonna tryand get me to join a cult, are you?

117
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
No, it's just, you know,you have that look.

118
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
Damn Supercuts!

119
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
- Well, what's up? Is Phoebe okay?- Oh, yeah, yeah.

120
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
Phoebe is great. But...

121
00:06:21 --> 00:06:22
I'm an idiot, okay?

122
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
Right before you guys went out,I accidentally got her all upset.

123
00:06:27 --> 00:06:28
That's why she was weird.

124
00:06:28 --> 00:06:32
Yes. I said something stupid about hernever having had a serious relationship.

125
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
But you should know, she isso much fun. A wonderful person.

126
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
- Please, don't blow her off.- I'm not gonna blow her off.

127
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
I just spoke to her.We're going out tomorrow night.

128
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
I mean, I hope that's okay with you,stranger from the coffeehouse.

129
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
Well, then, I didn't needto bother you.

130
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
You or the four otherMike Hanigans I bothered.

131
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.Is that true what you said?

132
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
Phoebe's never hada serious relationship?

133
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
Of course she has.

134
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
If she's never hada serious relationship...

135
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
...do you think I'd goaround broadcasting it...

136
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
...like some kindof unstoppable moron?

137
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
- But you did say it.- Yes. Yes, I did.

138
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
And I will also say...

139
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
...what I'm about to say...

140
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
...vis-a-vis...

141
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
...the following.

142
00:07:24 --> 00:07:29
Phoebe has never hada serious relationship...

143
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
...since...

144
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
...her super-serious relationship...

145
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
...with...

146
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
...Vikram.

147
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
- Vikram?- What? That's a real name.

148
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
Stop it!

149
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
Why couldn't they havesent me to Texas?

150
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
Seven o'clock.

151
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
Maybe I'll hit the gym.

152
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
Who am I kidding?Pay-per-view porn.

153
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
- Do not disturb! Do not disturb!- Surprise!

154
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
- Monica?- Is everything all right?

155
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
Yeah, everything's great.I was just...

156
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
...watching someregular television there.

157
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
What a pleasant surprise.

158
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
- I'm gonna go freshen up, okay?- Okay, honey.

159
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
That was close.

160
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
- Hello."- Hey", "Rach", "it's me."

161
00:08:45 --> 00:08:49
Okay, I just got to Chandler's room,and I caught him...

162
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
...molesting himself.

163
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
That couldn't have been pretty.

164
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
But you know, guys do that.

165
00:08:56 --> 00:08:57
Well, the weird part is...

166
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
...he was getting off...to a shark-attack show!

167
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
- No!- Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!

168
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
- While watching sharks?- Yeah.

169
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
Are you sure that's whathe was doing?

170
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
You know how many timesI've seen him jump up like that?

171
00:09:15 --> 00:09:16
Believe me, I know what he was doing.

172
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
Man! Sharks!

173
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
I always knew there was somethingweird about that dude.

174
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
You promised to love himno matter what.

175
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
"What" means, like, if hegets a disease or kills someone.

176
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
Not if he gets his jollies to "Jaws."

177
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
You know what, honey?Guys are just different.

178
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
They like thingsthat we can't understand.

179
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
I once dated this guywho wanted to pretend...

180
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
...that he was an archeologist,and I was this...

181
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
...naughty cavewomanwho he unfroze from a block of ice.

182
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
Are you talking about my brother?

183
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
I didn't disguise that very well, did I?

184
00:09:51 --> 00:09:52
- Hey.- Hi.

185
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
I went out with this girl last night.Halfway through our date I realized...

186
00:09:56 --> 00:09:57
...I already slept with her.

187
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
You've slept with all the women in N.Y.,and now you're going around again?

188
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
That's not even the weird part.

189
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
- She didn't remember sleeping with me!- You don't remember sleeping with her.

190
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
But she should remember sleepingwith me. I am very memorable!

191
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
- You guys know.- How do we know?

192
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
- We've never slept with you.- And whose fault is that?

193
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
What's the big deal?You forgot, she forgot.

194
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
- Maybe you were having an off night.- Hey!

195
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
I never have an off night. Okay?

196
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
Although, sometimes if I'ma little bloated, I don't feel that sexy.

197
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
But even then, I'm better than most!

198
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Honey, why don't you just let it goand ask her out again?

199
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
You're both so slutty, you don'tremember who you slept with.

200
00:10:36 --> 00:10:37
You're made for each other.

201
00:10:39 --> 00:10:40
Interesting.

202
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
Well, I'll go out with her againand I'll try to get past it.

203
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
No salt! Bloaty!

204
00:10:46 --> 00:10:47
- Joey?- What?

205
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
You don't thinksharks are sexy, do you?

206
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
No.

207
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Wait a minute.Wait, what was the Little Mermaid?

208
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
It's open!

209
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
- Hey.- Mike called! We're going out again!

210
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
Quick thing.I went to talk to Mike.

211
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
What?

212
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
What did you...?What did you do, Ross?

213
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.

214
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
I went over there, you know,to tell him how...

215
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
How great you are. But...

216
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
Well, you know me.Blah-blah-blah.

217
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
- And I ended up telling him that...- What?

218
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
You had a six-year-long relationship...

219
00:11:29 --> 00:11:30
...with a guy named Vikram.

220
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
What? Why?

221
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
Well, he seemed...

222
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
...to bum hard when I told him you'dnever been in a serious relationship.

223
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
If you hadn't just had a babywith my best friend...

224
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
...I swear to Lucifer...

225
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
...a rabid dog would be feastingon your danglers right now!

226
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
I think you'll feel differentlywhen you know...

227
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
...a little bit about Vikram.

228
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
Okay, he's a...

229
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
He's a kite designer.

230
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
And he used to date Oprah.

231
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
I'm not going alongwith some lie you made up, Ross.

232
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
- I'm just gonna be honest with him.- Good.

233
00:12:13 --> 00:12:14
Just be honest with him.

234
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.- No.

235
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
So I haven't been in a relationshipthat lasted longer than a month.

236
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.

237
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
If he can't handle it,then he can leave. Which he will.

238
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
And, you know, that's okay.So I'll just be alone forever.

239
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
You know, all right.It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

240
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
I'll go on walking tourswith widows and lesbians.

241
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
- I'll get it.- Okay.

242
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
I'm trying to remember the last timeI opened a door and you weren't there.

243
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
Phoebe, are you okay?

244
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
Yeah. There's just...

245
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
There's something you should know.

246
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
Vikram just called.

247
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
So it was really a shockafter 25 years of marriage...

248
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
...my parents getting divorced.I took it the hardest...

249
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
...because I was the youngest.- Sure. Yeah.

250
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
How can you not remember me?

251
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
What?

252
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
How could you not rememberthat we slept together?

253
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
- What? When?- I don't know!

254
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
I really, really thinkI would remember sleeping with you.

255
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
Come on, come on.Search your brain, all right? It was...

256
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
...a certain amount of time ago.I was here. You were here.

257
00:13:24 --> 00:13:25
We had sex here, here, here...

258
00:13:26 --> 00:13:27
Not there.

259
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
- Anything?- No, it's not ringing any bells.

260
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
My God, woman!

261
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
How many people have you been withnot to remember this?

262
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
Hey, Hayley.We really gotta fix that doorknob.

263
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
Joey?

264
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
I slept with you!

265
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
And you obviously remember me!Hey, I still got it!

266
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
So we're good.

267
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
I'll let myself out.

268
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
And I said, "Okay, Vikram...

269
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
...you can't just callevery time you get lonely.

270
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
You gave up that rightwhen you slept with Rachel."

271
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
Rachel? I thought she justhad a baby with Ross.

272
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
Yeah, well...

273
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
Yeah.

274
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
But Emma's birth certificatemight say "Geller"...

275
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
...but her eyes say "Mukherjee."

276
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
That is so wrong.And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?

277
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
I know. But he calls,and my heart goes to him.

278
00:14:21 --> 00:14:25
You know, that bastard is onesmooth-talking freelance kite designer.

279
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
I think there's somebodybetter out there for you.

280
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
I mean, you know, I'm...I'm not saying me, but...

281
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
Maybe... me.

282
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
And you don't have to worry aboutglue-sniffing with me.

283
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
Although, I do smellthe occasional Magic Marker.

284
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
Yeah. Anyway, I just...

285
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
I think I can make you happy.

286
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
- Okay, I can't do this.- What's wrong?

287
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
Well, there is no Vikram.Ross made him up.

288
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
Because I...

289
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
I really never have beenin a long-term relationship.

290
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
I've never lived with a guy. I've nevereven celebrated an anniversary.

291
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
So...

292
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
If that's too weird for you...

293
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
...and you want to leave,I understand.

294
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
In fact, I'll close my eyesto make it less awkward.

295
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
You kissed me.

296
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
- You don't think I'm a total freak?- No.

297
00:15:25 --> 00:15:26
Well...

298
00:15:27 --> 00:15:28
Look, can I...?

299
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
Can I think you're a little weirdand also cool...

300
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
...for telling me the truthand also want to kiss you?

301
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
I guess so.

302
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
Can I think it's coolthat you kissed me...

303
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
...and also want to kiss you again?

304
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
And be a little concernedabout the Magic Markers?

305
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
Definitely.

306
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
This is Vikram.

307
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
Hi, honey, I'm home.

308
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
Hi.

309
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
- How was your flight?- It was great.

310
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
Why don't you sit down.

311
00:16:08 --> 00:16:09
Get yourself comfortable.

312
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
Because I have a little...

313
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
...surprise for you.

314
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
Well, well, well.It must be 5:00 in Tulsa...

315
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
...because it's "sex o'clock" in N.Y.C.!

316
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
Okay.This is how much I love you.

317
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
The great white...

318
00:16:31 --> 00:16:32
Honey?

319
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
Why am I watchinga bunch of sharks swimming around?

320
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
Is this...?Is this not the good part?

321
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
Do you want me to fast-forwardto something... toothier?

322
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
No, I'm just not sure that yougot the right movie, that's all.

323
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
This is the only onethey had at our video store.

324
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
Though they did have somethingcalled "Crocodile Killers."

325
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
Or does it always have to be sharks?

326
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
Does what always have to be sharks?

327
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
Look, we can do something else.

328
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
Do you want me toget into the tub and... thrash?

329
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
- What's going on?- It's okay. It's okay.

330
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
I still love you.

331
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
- Let me be a part of this.- Let me be a part of this!

332
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
I saw what you were doing in Tulsa.

333
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
Angry sharks turn you on!

334
00:17:17 --> 00:17:18
No, they don't.

335
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
Then why were you watching themand giving yourself a treat?

336
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
Oh, my God! When you came in,I switched the channel.

337
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
I was just watching regular porn.

338
00:17:29 --> 00:17:29
Really?

339
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
Yes. Just some good, old-fashioned,American, girl-on-girl action.

340
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
Can I tell you how happythat makes me?

341
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
You are an amazing wife.

342
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
Really, you are amazing. You wereactually gonna do this for me?

343
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
Where do you find the strengthand the understanding for that?

344
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
I'm very, very drunk right now.

345
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
Ordinarily, I would talk to her,but my confidence is shaken.

346
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
Did I sleep with her?Did I not sleep with her?

347
00:18:02 --> 00:18:05
Maybe this is a wake-up call. You know,about your whole dating attitude.

348
00:18:06 --> 00:18:10
You're in your 30s and you havenever been in a long-term relationship.

349
00:18:10 --> 00:18:11
Here you go from woman to woman...

350
00:18:12 --> 00:18:13
...meaningless experienceto meaningless experience.

351
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
Never even worrying that it doesn'tturn into something more serious.

352
00:18:17 --> 00:18:19
You're right. I love my life!

353
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
I actually did sleep with her.

354
00:18:29 --> 00:18:30
