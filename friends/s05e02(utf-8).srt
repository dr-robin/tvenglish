1
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
You look cute in bubbles.

2
00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
You're just all liquored up.

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.

4
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
I've had a very long, hard day.

5
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
Want some chicken?

6
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
No, thanks. No chicken.Bye-bye.

7
00:00:30 --> 00:00:31
You sure?Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
For the last time, no!Get out, Joey!

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
All right.

10
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
Are you okay?He wouldn't leave.

11
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.

12
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
Chicken?

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
I could eat some chicken.

14
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Could I get a three-piece,some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?

15
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
Diet Coke.

16
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
The One WithAll the Kissing

17
00:01:30 --> 00:01:32
- Morning, Pheebs.- I have to tell you this story.

18
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
I was coming overand this cabdriver...

19
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
Was his name Angus?

20
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
What?

21
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
He was a cabdriverwe had in London.

22
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
All right. Anyway...

23
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
What was that pub he took us to?

24
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
The Wheat Sheaf!

25
00:01:45 --> 00:01:47
And they had that beer...

26
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
Boddington's!

27
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
Pheebs was going to tell a story.

28
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
So, he had a really funny hat.

29
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
I don't want to talk about it.

30
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
Hey Ross!

31
00:02:00 --> 00:02:01
Boddington's!

32
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
Oh, man!

33
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
I'd walk back to London for anotherfrosty one of those bad boys.

34
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
They have them at theBritish pub by the Trade Center.

35
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
Later!

36
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
Shouldn't Rachel be back?

37
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
Her plane got delayed.

38
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
But she should be here by now.

39
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
So you talked to her?Did she sound mad?

40
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
No. But she likes me.

41
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
You abandoned heron a plane to Greece.

42
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?

43
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
Emily showed up at the airport.

44
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
I had to go after her.I did what I had to do.

45
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
She's my wife.Rachel is my wife.

46
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
Emily!

47
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
Emily is my wife.

48
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Man, what is that?

49
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
You haven't heard from Emily?

50
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
Not since I lost her at the airport.

51
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
I can't believe she can outrun you.

52
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
Hey! She's fast, okay?

53
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
You think you can beat me?Let's go! Outside!

54
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
Rach, I am so sorry.I am so, so sorry.

55
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
Come on.You just did what you had to do.

56
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
That's it? You're not mad?It must've been terrible.

57
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!

58
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
There was a nice hotel, nice beach,met the nice people.

59
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
It's not too shabby for Rachel.

60
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
So, what, that's it?

61
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
We're cool. Totally cool.

62
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
Thanks, Rach.You're the best.

63
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
Oh, no. You're the best.

64
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.

65
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
No one will tell me where Emily is...

66
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, redroses to her parents' house.

67
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
One for each dayI've known and loved her.

68
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
That should get her talking.

69
00:03:38 --> 00:03:43
When you make out the card,be sure to make it out to "Emily".

70
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
It's good that you hadsuch a good time in Greece.

71
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
What?

72
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
I didn't have a good time in Greece!

73
00:03:54 --> 00:03:55
Ross abandoned me!

74
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
I couldn't get a plane out.I had to stay in their suite!

75
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
People came up to me going,"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"

76
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
I mean, it was so humiliating!

77
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
I felt like such an idiot!

78
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
It's all my fault.You know why?

79
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
Because I make very bad decisions.

80
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
Oh, that's not true.

81
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
Yes, it is true.I went after Ross in stupid London!

82
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
London is stupid! Stupid!

83
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
I should've never gone to London.

84
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
From now on, you makeall my decisions for me.

85
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
Oh, no.I did that for someone once.

86
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
I'm not comfortable havingthat power over someone's life.

87
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
I'll do it.

88
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
Fine. Monica, you are nowin charge of my love life.

89
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
Okay. I got to go to work.

90
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
And Rachel, great to have you back.

91
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
Always a pleasure.

92
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
Rachel? Sweetie, look.

93
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.

94
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
He's married.

95
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Ross is married.I still can't believe it.

96
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.

97
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
I'll just have to accept it.

98
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
I mean, it's my fault.

99
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!

100
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
Oh, my God!

101
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
That's okay. I know thatyou're very upset right now.

102
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
I know that wasn't about me.

103
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
I bet it was about her a little.

104
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...

105
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
...you'd notice there aregreat guys everywhere.

106
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Look. Gunther.

107
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
He's nice. He's cute.

108
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Yeah. I guess Gunther is...

109
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
What about that guy over there?

110
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
That's the guy you flirted withat the counter.

111
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
Oh, I don't know.I don't know.

112
00:05:53 --> 00:05:54
You'll too talk to him.

113
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
I make your decisions,and I say you'll too talk to him.

114
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
All right.

115
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
You're the boss.I got to do what you tell me.

116
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
Say that to him, and you're golden.

117
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
Hey, Pheebs.We got our pictures back from London.

118
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
Here's all of usat the Tower of London...

119
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Here we all are.

120
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
There's Ross and Joey and you and...

121
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
And me.

122
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
We've been talking aboutLondon too much.

123
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
Sorry, it's just becauseI couldn't be there.

124
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.It bums me out.

125
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
- I'm sorry.- Sorry.

126
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
- What happened?- A little of this, a little of that.

127
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
I got myself a date tomorrow.

128
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
See? Didn't I tell you?You're getting over Ross already.

129
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
Get out.

130
00:06:52 --> 00:06:53
What took so long?

131
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
I got caught up at work.But I'm quitting tomorrow.

132
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
So, thanks for having me over.

133
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
See you, man.

134
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
What the hell was that?

135
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
Probably some Europeangoodbye thing he picked up in London.

136
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
That's not European.

137
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
It felt French.

138
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
I really had a good time.

139
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
Yeah, me too.

140
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
I guess this is it.

141
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
Unless you want to come inside?

142
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
Wait a minute. You know what?I can't decide this.

143
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
Okay. Just hold on a second.

144
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
Where's Monica?I have to ask her something.

145
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
Doing her laundry.

146
00:08:00 --> 00:08:01
What's that?

147
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
It came in the mail today.

148
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
It's 72 long-stemmed, red roses.

149
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
One for each dayI've known and loved Emily...

150
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
...cut up into mulch.

151
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
Honey, that's awful.

152
00:08:15 --> 00:08:15
It's not so bad.

153
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
Monica's going to make potpourri.

154
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
I think I'm going to gowander out in the rain for a while.

155
00:08:24 --> 00:08:24
It's not raining.

156
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
I can't catch a break!

157
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
You're not going anywhere.Sit right here.

158
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
I'll make you some teaand we'll talk this out.

159
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
All right?

160
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
Hey, Dave.

161
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
I need to take a rain check.My roommate is really sick.

162
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
Okay. Bye!

163
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Honey, listen.

164
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
I know things seem sobad...

165
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
...and that they won't get any...

166
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
Could I talk to you?

167
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
I dropped some socks.

168
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
What is the matter with you?Do you want to fall into the trap?

169
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
You did not drop any socks!

170
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
I saw Dave, and he saidyou blew him off!

171
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
You listen to me!

172
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
I'm calling the shots!I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.

173
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
What are you doing?

174
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
Well, ultimately I was trying,you know, I wanted...

175
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
...to tell him thatI'm still in love with him.

176
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
What? You cannot tell him that!

177
00:09:27 --> 00:09:28
Why? Why not?

178
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
People love to hear that!

179
00:09:31 --> 00:09:32
I make the decisions and I say no!

180
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
You know what? No, you don'tmake my decisions, because...

181
00:09:36 --> 00:09:37
...you're fired.

182
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
You can't fire me.

183
00:09:39 --> 00:09:44
I make your decisions,and I say I'm not fired! Ha!

184
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
Well...

185
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
Come on, let me in!

186
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
Having some trouble?

187
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
Rachel locked the door.

188
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
I'll kick that door inif you give me some sugar.

189
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
Rachel! Let me in!

190
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
Thank you.

191
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
Rachel? Can I talk to yououtside for a sec?

192
00:10:21 --> 00:10:22
We really need to talk.

193
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
Well, then talk.

194
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
Okay, I will.

195
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
Remember that thing we just discussedthat you wanted to do?

196
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
What thing?

197
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
Rachel wants to takeswing dance lessons.

198
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
Which I think is a really stupid idea.

199
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
It's dangerous.She won't get what she wants.

200
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
And who knows who she mightend up hurting?

201
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
Monica's right.Swing dancing can be tricky.

202
00:10:54 --> 00:10:55
I have to use the phone.

203
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
I got to cancel those five, giantteddy bears I sent to Emily.

204
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
My God! Think of the massacre.

205
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
I'm going to do it.

206
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
I know you think I'm crazy.

207
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
But before you tell him,try to find one person...

208
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
...who thinks it's a good idea.I bet you can't.

209
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
Please?

210
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
All right. Fine.

211
00:11:17 --> 00:11:18
Joey! I'm in!

212
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
All right. Good deal.

213
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
You know how you were sayingyou didn't get to go to London...

214
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
...and you were feeling left out?

215
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
Well, we all felt really badabout that...

216
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
...so we decided totake a little trip together!

217
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
Oh, that's so nice!

218
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
How great!Where's the trip?

219
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
Well, we thought we would allgo to a picnic...

220
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
...in Central Park!

221
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
Central Park?

222
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
All of us. All day.

223
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
That sucks!

224
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
That's not a trip!I just came from there.

225
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
What'll we high-five aboutat the stupid park?

226
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
It's right by my house.All right!

227
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
I'm going home to bask in thetriumph of my Central Park idea.

228
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.

229
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
I wanted to talk to you about...

230
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
...this whole new European thingyou've got going on.

231
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
And I need to sayit makes me very uncomfortable...

232
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
...and I just, you know, just stop it!

233
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
Just bringing some cultureto the group.

234
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
That's fine.Just don't bring it in my mouth.

235
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
It makes me want to puke.

236
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
Hey, everybody!Pheebs is here!

237
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
- Phoebe! Woo!- Okay. Woo! Hi!

238
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
Pheebs, we decided thatthe picnic idea was a little...

239
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
It didn't have any...Well, it blew.

240
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
We thought that this afternoon we'dall go away for the whole weekend...

241
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
...to Atlantic City.

242
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
Atlantic City! Oh, that'sa great plan! Whose plan was that?

243
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
Mine!

244
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
- Wait. It was my plan.- No...

245
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
...I said we needed a new plan.

246
00:13:02 --> 00:13:03
And I came up with Atlantic City.

247
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
Which is the new plan.

248
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
Why don't we allmeet upstairs in an hour.

249
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
I'm going to go pack.I'm going to go pack my ass off.

250
00:13:16 --> 00:13:17
Let's go.

251
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
You know what?I'll meet you in a minute.

252
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
Rachel, you didn't find anyone,so you can't tell him.

253
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
You know what?That doesn't matter.

254
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
Do you know how painful it isto tell someone you love them...

255
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
...and not have them say it back?

256
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
I don't care.

257
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
I can't watch.

258
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
What you reading?

259
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
Paper.

260
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
Yeah? What's it about?

261
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
The events from around the globe.

262
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
There's somethingI have to talk to you about.

263
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.

264
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
But I think they're wrong.People can be wrong.

265
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
Once at work...

266
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
...I thought carbon datingis fossilized...

267
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
I'm really trying to tellyou something here.

268
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
Go ahead.

269
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
I think I'm just going to say it.

270
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
I'm just going to say it.

271
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
I'm still in love with you.

272
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
I'm not sure what to dowith that right now.

273
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
What? Was that a joke?Because it's mean.

274
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
I'm so dead serious!

275
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
I'm totally serious!

276
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
Why are you laughing?

277
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
Because I just heard it!

278
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
I heard it! And it's ridiculous!

279
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
I mean...

280
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
You're married!

281
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
You're married,and it's just ridiculous!

282
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
When I said it, I sort offloated up out of my body.

283
00:15:13 --> 00:15:18
And then I heard myself say it,and then the floating Rachel...

284
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"

285
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
- Well, I am married.- I know.

286
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
Though I haven't spoken to hersince the wedding.

287
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

288
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
Actually, it kind of is.

289
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
My wife won't return my calls.

290
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
I don't know where my wife is.

291
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?""Don't know!"

292
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
Oh, God!

293
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
You know what?Could you forget I told you this?

294
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
Well, I kind of have to.

295
00:16:03 --> 00:16:04
Because the thing is...

296
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
The thing is, you know,that you're married to Emily.

297
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
That is what the thing is.

298
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
Oh, God.

299
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
Things won't be weird between us,right? Was that stupid?

300
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
Me telling you that?

301
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
I'm glad you did.

302
00:16:25 --> 00:16:26
If nothing else...

303
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
...it's always great when someonetells you they love you.

304
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
That's what I said!

305
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
- Thank you for being so nice.- No. Thank you for...

306
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
Thank you.

307
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
- Okay, let's go!- Yeah, Atlantic City!

308
00:16:43 --> 00:16:44
Come on!

309
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
Atlantic City, baby!

310
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
Let's roll some bones.Hey, Joey!

311
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
High-five for rolling bones.

312
00:16:54 --> 00:16:55
Pheebs, you're leaking.

313
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
Oh, my God! Your water broke!

314
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.

315
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
Pheebs, we have to take youto the hospital now.

316
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
Pheebs, the babies are coming now.

317
00:17:07 --> 00:17:10
Honey! High-five!The babies are coming!

318
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
Remember when my water broke?

319
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
Phoebe's going to have her babies!

320
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
I know.It's beautiful and amazing.

321
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachelevery time I left the room.

322
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
It's too bad they didn'tsee us having sex.

323
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
Do you know anything about women?

324
00:17:37 --> 00:17:40
- It's all right.- Okay.
