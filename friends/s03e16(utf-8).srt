00:00:03.14,00:00:06.06

17

-Previously on Friends. . . .[br]-I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.

18



19

00:00:06.30,00:00:09.18

20

You want me to quit my job so you[br]can feel like you have a girlfriend?

21



22

00:00:09.42,00:00:11.18

23

-Is this about Mark?[br]-Oh, my God.

24



25

00:00:11.42,00:00:13.62

26

-Okay, it's not.[br]-Oh, my God.

27



28

00:00:13.90,00:00:15.90

29

I cannot keep having this[br]fight with you!

30



31

00:00:16.14,00:00:18.26

32

Maybe we should just take a break.

33



34

00:00:18.50,00:00:20.50

35

Fine. You're right.[br]Let's take a break.

36



37

00:00:20.74,00:00:23.50

38

Let's get some frozen yogurt[br]or something.

39



40

00:00:24.58,00:00:26.34

41

A break from us.

42



43

00:00:28.54,00:00:31.90

44

Then we had this big fight,[br]and I said I wanted to take a break.

45



46

00:00:32.22,00:00:33.78

47

I don't want to take a break.

48



49

00:00:34.02,00:00:35.06

50

This is crazy.

51



52

00:00:35.30,00:00:36.90

53

Can 't we work on this?

54



55

00:00:37.18,00:00:38.06

56

What do you want to drink?

57



58

00:00:38.58,00:00:39.38

59

Who's that?

60



61

00:00:40.98,00:00:41.78

62

Nobody.

63



64

00:00:42.78,00:00:43.58

65

Is that Mark?

66



67

00:00:43.78,00:00:44.90

68

Honey, look, he just--

69



70

00:00:45.26,00:00:46.41

71

Yeah. Got it!

72



73

00:00:47.86,00:00:50.66

74

Hey, come dance.[br]What, are you married?

75



76

00:00:50.98,00:00:52.58

77

Because that's okay.

78

THE NEXT MORNING

81



82

00:01:08.26,00:01:10.33

83

How was the big anniversary dinner?

84



85

00:01:10.54,00:01:13.78

86

Well, we never actually got to dinner.

87



88

00:01:14.42,00:01:15.30

89

Nice.

90



91

00:01:17.34,00:01:18.98

92

We kind of broke up instead.

93



94

00:01:19.22,00:01:20.10

95

What?

96



97

00:01:23.62,00:01:25.58

98

My God![br]It's on the ceiling!

99



100

00:01:25.82,00:01:26.78

101

That's okay.

102



103

00:01:27.06,00:01:29.02

104

This is more important than fruit. . .

105



106

00:01:29.42,00:01:30.70

107

. . .on my ceiling.

108



109

00:01:32.38,00:01:33.18

110

You broke up?

111



112

00:01:33.42,00:01:37.42

113

Yeah, but it's okay because[br]when Ross left, Mark came over.

114



115

00:01:37.66,00:01:40.05

116

-Oh, no! You and Mark?[br]-It's okay. Calm down.

117



118

00:01:40.30,00:01:41.62

119

Mark and I talked. . .

120



121

00:01:41.86,00:01:45.90

122

. . .and I realized how much[br]I love your stupid brother.

123



124

00:01:46.38,00:01:49.46

125

We got our problems,[br]but I really wanna make it work.

126



127

00:02:06.18,00:02:07.17

128

Morning!

135



136

00:03:02.06,00:03:05.98

137

It's me. I've been trying[br]to reach you all night. I feel awful.

138



139

00:03:06.18,00:03:09.10

140

There's nothing between me and Mark.

141



142

00:03:09.34,00:03:12.58

143

This whole breakup thing[br]is just stupid.

144



145

00:03:14.62,00:03:16.77

146

I'm sorry I put you through it.

147



148

00:03:17.02,00:03:20.38

149

And I don 't want to get[br]back together over a machine.

150



151

00:03:20.94,00:03:22.38

152

So I love you.

153



154

00:03:22.58,00:03:23.38

155

I love you.

156



157

00:03:23.58,00:03:26.78

158

And you know what?[br]I'm gonna go to bed now...

159



160

00:03:27.02,00:03:31.62

161

...but on my way to work tomorrow,[br]I'll stop by around 8:30. Bye.

162



163

00:03:34.74,00:03:36.02

164

Chloe, how's it coming?

165



166

00:03:36.26,00:03:38.57

167

What kind of puppy do you think[br]I should get?

168



169

00:03:38.78,00:03:40.66

170

Well, how about a big one?

171



172

00:03:40.98,00:03:43.37

173

-But my apartment's so--[br]-Then a small one.

174



175

00:03:43.58,00:03:45.89

176

-We have to go.[br]-Wait! Where's my shoes?

177



178

00:03:46.14,00:03:47.18

179

You need shoes?

180



181

00:03:50.46,00:03:54.09

182

-Do I know why we're rushing?[br]-You know my girlfriend?

183



184

00:03:54.34,00:03:57.22

185

It turns out that she wants[br]to get back together.

186



187

00:03:57.46,00:03:58.37

188

I found it!

189



190

00:03:58.58,00:04:00.58

191

That's so great for you guys!

192



193

00:04:00.86,00:04:02.22

194

You must be so happy!

195



196

00:04:02.42,00:04:05.18

197

Yes, I am. One of the many[br]things I'm feeling.

198



199

00:04:07.34,00:04:10.02

200

-Good luck with your girlfriend.[br]-Thank you.

201



202

00:04:18.82,00:04:21.74

203

-You got my message?[br]-You are right on time!

204



205

00:04:22.14,00:04:24.29

206

So can I be your girlfriend again?

207



208

00:04:24.58,00:04:25.98

209

Yes, you can. very much.

210



211

00:04:34.18,00:04:37.57

212

-Why are you mopping your ceiling?[br]-There's banana on it.

213



214

00:04:38.62,00:04:41.98

215

I have the spirit of an[br]old lndian woman living in mine.

216



217

00:04:43.26,00:04:44.22

218

So, then, you know.

219



220

00:04:47.42,00:04:49.49

221

The mailman was here,[br]so I brought your mail.

222



223

00:04:49.74,00:04:52.74

224

-Oh, good. Thanks.[br]-Now, what is Fabutech?

225



226

00:04:53.30,00:04:55.86

227

Don't judge me too much, okay?

228



229

00:04:56.10,00:04:59.38

230

I saw this infomercial,[br]and I swear I have never. . .

231



232

00:04:59.58,00:05:01.70

233

. . .bought anything on Tv before.

234



235

00:05:01.94,00:05:03.66

236

Except for this mop.

237



238

00:05:04.38,00:05:06.69

239

But there was this amazing stuff[br]on leg-waxing--

240



241

00:05:06.94,00:05:07.82

242

Waxine!

243



244

00:05:08.06,00:05:09.38

245

Yes! Have you seen it?

246



247

00:05:09.62,00:05:12.06

248

It's incredible![br]I want to be a Waxine Girl!

249



250

00:05:12.30,00:05:13.45

251

I know!

252



253

00:05:14.78,00:05:18.06

254

Do you think it really doesn't hurt?[br]How can they do that?

255



256

00:05:18.30,00:05:21.54

257

Hello! Organic substances recently[br]discovered in the rain forest?

258



259

00:05:22.06,00:05:24.34

260

They have the best stuff in there.

261



262

00:05:25.62,00:05:26.94

263

Oh, my God!

264



265

00:05:28.26,00:05:29.62

266

Oh, my God!

267



268

00:05:30.54,00:05:34.38

269

We figured when we couldn't find you,[br]you'd gone to make up with Rachel.

270



271

00:05:34.62,00:05:36.66

272

Which is probably what[br]you should have done.

273



274

00:05:38.18,00:05:39.01

275

You think?

276



277

00:05:40.58,00:05:43.89

278

God, I'm in hell.[br]I mean, what am I gonna do?

279



280

00:05:44.14,00:05:48.02

281

Rachel's all "I love you,"[br]and all I can think about. . .

282



283

00:05:48.26,00:05:50.98

284

. . .is what is she gonna do[br]when I tell her what I did?

285



286

00:05:51.26,00:05:54.78

287

First, we should address[br]the more important question. . .

288



289

00:05:54.98,00:05:56.34

290

. . .how dumb are you?

291



292

00:05:58.42,00:06:02.10

293

Look, we're trying to[br]rebuild a relationship here, right?

294



295

00:06:02.34,00:06:04.78

296

How can I do that[br]without being honest?

297



298

00:06:05.02,00:06:08.18

299

I'm onboard about[br]the total-honesty thing. I am.

300



301

00:06:08.38,00:06:11.77

302

Just not about stuff that's[br]gonna get you in trouble.

303



304

00:06:12.26,00:06:15.22

305

He's right. Nobody benefits,[br]and you'll just hurt her.

306



307

00:06:15.46,00:06:18.18

308

And there won't be a relationship[br]left to rebuild.

309



310

00:06:18.38,00:06:19.26

311

Don't you think--

312



313

00:06:19.50,00:06:22.81

314

If you have to tell her,[br]at least wait till the timing's right.

315



316

00:06:23.06,00:06:24.98

317

And that's what deathbeds are for.

318



319

00:06:27.78,00:06:29.70

320

-Yeah, okay.[br]-All right.

321



322

00:06:30.02,00:06:34.86

323

Okay. Now, we just have to make sure[br]she doesn't find out some other way.

324



325

00:06:36.06,00:06:38.18

326

Did you think about the trail?

327



328

00:06:40.18,00:06:41.01

329

What trail?

330



331

00:06:43.46,00:06:44.98

332

From the woman[br]you did it with. . .

333



334

00:06:45.22,00:06:48.38

335

. . .to the woman you hope[br]never finds out you did it!

336



337

00:06:49.10,00:06:50.94

338

Always think about the trail!

339



340

00:06:52.66,00:06:54.97

341

I don't think there's any trail.

342



343

00:06:56.74,00:06:59.02

344

Chloe works with that guy, lsaac.

345



346

00:06:59.22,00:07:03.18

347

Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works[br]at the massage place with Phoebe.

348



349

00:07:03.38,00:07:06.26

350

Phoebe is Rachel's friend,[br]and that's the trail! I did it!

351



352

00:07:09.02,00:07:11.82

353

"After applying the Waxine[br]and linen strips to leg--"

354



355

00:07:12.06,00:07:13.13

356

Did that!

357



358

00:07:14.22,00:07:16.58

359

"Grasp the linen strip by its tab. . .

360



361

00:07:16.82,00:07:19.58

362

. . .and pull it off in one quick,[br]pain-free motion. "

363



364

00:07:23.94,00:07:25.38

365

Was it not "pain-free"?

366



367

00:07:26.66,00:07:28.42

368

No, it was pain-ful!

369



370

00:07:28.66,00:07:32.10

371

My God, they should call it[br]"Pain-zine, now with a little wax. "

372



373

00:07:33.66,00:07:37.37

374

The girls on the commercial[br]don't seem to think it's that bad.

375



376

00:07:37.58,00:07:40.58

377

Because their nerves are[br]deadened from being so stupid.

378



379

00:07:42.26,00:07:46.30

380

But you know, if you don't[br]believe me, please, be my guest.

381



382

00:07:50.82,00:07:53.78

383

Now are you glad we didn't start[br]with the bikini strips?

384



385

00:07:59.34,00:08:00.46

386

Chloe, hi.

387



388

00:08:01.46,00:08:03.46

389

Is this about me taking your watch?

390



391

00:08:04.46,00:08:07.46

392

-You took my watch?[br]-I'm sorry. I do that.

393



394

00:08:08.26,00:08:11.62

395

You keep it. Listen, did you[br]tell anyone about us?

396



397

00:08:11.86,00:08:14.82

398

I feel like it really isn't[br]anybody's business.

399



400

00:08:15.06,00:08:18.06

401

Exactly. So you didn't[br]mention anything to lsaac?

402



403

00:08:18.30,00:08:21.82

404

-I tell lsaac everything.[br]-You do? Of course you do.

405



406

00:08:23.94,00:08:27.02

407

Hi, lsaac.[br]You know, we haven't actually met.

408



409

00:08:27.26,00:08:28.74

410

You dog!

411



412

00:08:31.46,00:08:35.70

413

Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But see,[br]I happen to have a girlfriend.

414



415

00:08:35.94,00:08:38.06

416

Right. Rachel from the coffee place.

417



418

00:08:38.30,00:08:40.98

419

That's the one.[br]Listen, I don't want to hurt her.

420



421

00:08:41.22,00:08:43.82

422

I know. It doesn't matter[br]how much we love them.

423



424

00:08:44.06,00:08:46.50

425

Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

426



427

00:08:49.14,00:08:52.58

428

Listen, can you keep this[br]information to yourself?

429



430

00:08:52.82,00:08:55.10

431

No problem.[br]We gotta look out for each other.

432



433

00:08:55.34,00:08:57.02

434

We're the same, you and me.

435



436

00:09:00.06,00:09:02.50

437

Actually, no, we're not.

438



439

00:09:02.74,00:09:04.02

440

Yeah, we are.

441



442

00:09:04.66,00:09:06.30

443

No, we're not.

444



445

00:09:06.54,00:09:07.77

446

Yeah, we are.

447



448

00:09:09.06,00:09:10.02

449

No, we're not.

450



451

00:09:10.26,00:09:12.49

452

-Okay, we're not.[br]-Right.

453



454

00:09:12.74,00:09:13.54

455

But we are.

456



457

00:09:16.26,00:09:19.57

458

Fine. I just need to know[br]that you won't tell your sister.

459



460

00:09:20.34,00:09:22.57

461

I can promise not to tell her again.

462



463

00:09:26.58,00:09:30.50

464

Jasmine? We met at Phoebe's[br]birthday party. I'm Ross Geller.

465



466

00:09:31.14,00:09:32.90

467

You did a bad thing!

468



469

00:09:34.22,00:09:35.62

470

-Yes, I did.[br]-very bad!

471



472

00:09:35.86,00:09:37.66

473

-very bad.[br]-very, very bad!

474



475

00:09:38.62,00:09:39.82

476

I'm agreeing with you.

477



478

00:09:40.06,00:09:42.50

479

Listen, did you happen[br]to tell Phoebe yet?

480



481

00:09:45.18,00:09:47.49

482

Please. Please don't.

483



484

00:09:47.74,00:09:52.02

485

I love my girlfriend very much[br]and I want to work it out with her.

486



487

00:09:54.06,00:09:54.94

488

All right.

489



490

00:09:55.54,00:09:57.02

491

Thank you. Thank you.

492



493

00:09:57.26,00:10:01.10

494

But you should talk to my roommate.[br]I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.

495



496

00:10:01.54,00:10:02.69

497

Who's your roommate?

498



499

00:10:05.62,00:10:10.30

500

Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about[br]me and the girl from the copy place.

501



502

00:10:10.82,00:10:12.10

503

I'm sorry.

504



505

00:10:12.34,00:10:14.06

506

Was I not supposed to?

507



508

00:10:33.94,00:10:36.94

509

-We're all right.[br]-It's okay. It's okay.

510



511

00:10:37.86,00:10:40.38

512

-We were just waxing our legs.[br]-Off?

513



514

00:10:42.30,00:10:46.46

515

For your information, this is a pain[br]like no man will ever experience.

516



517

00:10:46.70,00:10:49.30

518

Unless you've been kicked in an area. . .

519



520

00:10:49.54,00:10:52.18

521

. . .that God only meant[br]to be treated nicely.

522



523

00:10:53.06,00:10:56.98

524

Women just have a lower threshold[br]for pain than men, that's all.

525



526

00:10:57.18,00:10:59.65

527

I mean, come on,[br]it's just a little wax.

528



529

00:11:00.26,00:11:01.49

530

Oh, yeah? Come here.

531



532

00:11:03.54,00:11:04.90

533

Oh, that's mature.

534



535

00:11:06.62,00:11:08.38

536

So now I just pull it off?

537



538

00:11:08.62,00:11:09.58

539

That's right.

540



541

00:11:16.70,00:11:18.18

542

Just talk to me.[br]Please!

543



544

00:11:18.38,00:11:21.30

545

Talk to you?[br]I can't even look at you right now.

546



547

00:11:22.26,00:11:23.90

548

Nothing. Nothing.

549



550

00:11:24.66,00:11:27.50

551

-She said it was okay.[br]-What are they talking about?

552



553

00:11:29.10,00:11:32.10

554

-Just get away from me![br]-I made a mistake, okay?

555



556

00:11:32.34,00:11:36.18

557

A mistake? What were you trying[br]to put it in? Her purse?

558



559

00:11:38.46,00:11:40.46

560

Where did he put it?

561



562

00:11:43.54,00:11:45.66

563

You had sex with another woman!

564



565

00:11:46.26,00:11:47.78

566

Oh, my God!

567



568

00:11:47.98,00:11:52.26

569

I knew something was wrong because[br]my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.

570



571

00:11:53.74,00:11:56.46

572

I guess they had a fight,[br]and he got drunk--

573



574

00:11:56.86,00:11:59.38

575

You guys knew about this[br]and didn't tell us?

576



577

00:11:59.58,00:12:01.97

578

He has sex and we get hit[br]in our heads!

579



580

00:12:02.54,00:12:04.90

581

I want you to leave![br]Just get out! Now!

582



583

00:12:05.14,00:12:06.90

584

I want to stay and talk about this.

585



586

00:12:08.26,00:12:09.94

587

All right. How was she?

588



589

00:12:15.26,00:12:16.78

590

-What?[br]-Was she good?

591



592

00:12:16.98,00:12:17.97

593

Don't answer that.

594



595

00:12:21.14,00:12:24.50

596

You said you wanted to talk about it.[br]Let's talk. How was she?

597



598

00:12:25.86,00:12:27.22

599

-She was. . . .[br]-Awful.

600



601

00:12:27.46,00:12:30.42

602

-She was not good.[br]-Horrible. Nothing compared to you.

603



604

00:12:32.22,00:12:33.21

605

She was different.

606



607

00:12:36.34,00:12:37.74

608

Good different?

609



610

00:12:39.18,00:12:40.94

611

Nobody likes change.

612



613

00:12:42.06,00:12:44.45

614

-Just stop![br]-What? Okay! Okay! Okay!

615



616

00:12:45.18,00:12:46.41

617

Should we do something?

618



619

00:12:46.66,00:12:48.73

620

Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.

621



622

00:12:50.86,00:12:54.46

623

I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.[br]I was disgusted with myself. . .

624



625

00:12:54.70,00:12:56.14

626

. . .and this morning[br]I was upset. . .

627



628

00:12:56.46,00:12:58.82

629

. . .and then I got your[br]message and I was so happy.

630



631

00:12:59.06,00:13:01.98

632

And all I wanted was to get her out[br]of my apartment--

633



634

00:13:02.18,00:13:05.02

635

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa![br]Wait a minute.

636



637

00:13:06.58,00:13:09.05

638

What time did your[br]little friend leave?

639



640

00:13:12.82,00:13:15.58

641

Oh, my God. She was there?[br]She was still there?

642



643

00:13:15.82,00:13:18.78

644

She was in there when I was in there?

645



646

00:13:22.86,00:13:26.10

647

Listen, the important thing is[br]she meant nothing to me.

648



649

00:13:26.38,00:13:29.77

650

And yet she was worth[br]jeopardizing our relationship!

651



652

00:13:31.38,00:13:33.42

653

I didn't think there was[br]a relationship.

654



655

00:13:33.66,00:13:35.86

656

-We'd broken up.[br]-We were on a break.

657



658

00:13:36.10,00:13:39.49

659

That, for all I knew, could last[br]forever. That is a breakup.

660



661

00:13:39.74,00:13:41.38

662

You gonna get out of this[br]on a technicality?

663



664

00:13:41.62,00:13:43.82

665

I'm not trying to "get out"[br]of anything.

666



667

00:13:44.06,00:13:45.78

668

I thought our relationship was dead.

669



670

00:13:45.98,00:13:49.77

671

Well, you sure had a hell of a time[br]at the wake.

672



673

00:13:50.98,00:13:53.50

674

I don't think we should listen[br]to this anymore.

675



676

00:13:53.74,00:13:55.62

677

What are you doing?[br]We can't go out.

678



679

00:13:55.86,00:13:57.98

680

Why not? I'm hungry.

681



682

00:13:59.46,00:14:01.90

683

Because they'll know[br]we've been listening.

684



685

00:14:02.26,00:14:05.02

686

God! And to have to hear about it[br]from Gunther!

687



688

00:14:05.22,00:14:08.85

689

I ran all over the place trying[br]to make sure that didn't happen!

690



691

00:14:10.94,00:14:12.94

692

Oh, that is so sweet.

693



694

00:14:14.54,00:14:17.22

695

I think I'm falling in love with you[br]all over again.

696



697

00:14:19.54,00:14:22.78

698

We can go out. They have[br]other things to worry about.

699



700

00:14:23.02,00:14:24.09

701

We'll be fine.

702



703

00:14:24.30,00:14:27.61

704

Rachel, I wanted to tell you.[br]I thought I should.

705



706

00:14:27.86,00:14:31.38

707

And then Chandler and Joey[br]convinced me not to!

708



709

00:14:34.86,00:14:37.46

710

Wax the door shut.[br]We're never leaving.

711



712

00:14:38.94,00:14:42.57

713

It's Phoebe. Someone has to take[br]my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak. . .

714



715

00:14:42.78,00:14:45.66

716

. . .because it's 9: 1 5 now,[br]and I'm not there.

717



718

00:14:47.58,00:14:50.82

719

None of this would've happened[br]if I didn't think. . .

720



721

00:14:51.06,00:14:53.26

722

. . .you were having sex with Mark?

723



724

00:14:53.46,00:14:54.53

725

All right.

726



727

00:14:55.26,00:14:59.50

728

Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would[br]you have been able to forgive me?

729



730

00:15:01.98,00:15:03.58

731

Yes, I would.

732



733

00:15:06.02,00:15:10.18

734

You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me,[br]and been naked with me. . .

735



736

00:15:10.38,00:15:11.74

737

. . .and made love to me?

738



739

00:15:15.42,00:15:19.02

740

If you knew that our hot, sweaty,[br]writhing bodies were--

741



742

00:15:24.62,00:15:27.01

743

I would have been devastated. . .

744



745

00:15:27.54,00:15:29.74

746

. . .but I would still want[br]to be with you.

747



748

00:15:30.26,00:15:32.54

749

Because, I mean, it's you.

750



751

00:15:43.86,00:15:46.42

752

Come on, tell me what you're thinking.

753



754

00:15:49.06,00:15:50.74

755

I'm thinking. . .

756



757

00:15:53.38,00:15:55.22

758

. . .I'm gonna order a pizza.

759



760

00:15:58.34,00:15:59.90

761

Order a pizza, like. . .

762



763

00:16:00.94,00:16:02.58

764

. . . "I forgive you"?

765



766

00:16:07.62,00:16:08.61

767

Oh, man!

768



769

00:16:09.26,00:16:10.17

770

Pizza?

771



772

00:16:11.38,00:16:12.82

773

I like pizza.

774



775

00:16:14.46,00:16:16.53

776

Put olives on the pizza.

777



778

00:16:21.38,00:16:23.61

779

We could eat the wax! It's organic!

780



781

00:16:24.78,00:16:26.90

782

Oh, great. Food with hair on it.

783



784

00:16:28.66,00:16:30.30

785

No, not the used wax.

786



787

00:16:30.54,00:16:32.74

788

Because that would be crazy?

789



790

00:16:35.62,00:16:39.30

791

Could I get in on that?[br]Because I'm kind of hungry myself.

792



793

00:16:39.54,00:16:40.53

794

Fine.

795



796

00:16:40.86,00:16:43.42

797

Yes, I'd like to order[br]a large pizza.

798



799

00:16:43.66,00:16:46.70

800

-No anchovies.[br]-With extra anchovies.

801



802

00:16:47.62,00:16:48.98

803

That's okay.[br]I'll pick them off.

804



805

00:16:49.18,00:16:52.38

806

And could you chop some up[br]and put it right in the sauce?

807



808

00:16:58.82,00:17:00.82

809

You can have the last piece[br]if you want.

810



811

00:17:01.06,00:17:03.78

812

Well, I should think so.[br]You slept with someone.

813



814

00:17:15.86,00:17:18.38

815

They're gonna get through this,[br]aren't they?

816



817

00:17:18.74,00:17:21.42

818

Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.

819



820

00:17:21.66,00:17:22.54

821

They've got to.

822



823

00:17:24.46,00:17:25.74

824

What if they don't?

825



826

00:17:30.02,00:17:32.22

827

You think I need a new walk?

828



829

00:17:35.46,00:17:36.26

830

What?

831



832

00:17:36.50,00:17:40.18

833

Well, I've been walking[br]the same way since high school.

834



835

00:17:40.54,00:17:44.17

836

You know how some guys walk into[br]a room and everybody takes notice?

837



838

00:17:44.42,00:17:46.30

839

I think I need a take-notice walk.

840



841

00:17:47.26,00:17:49.26

842

Are you actually saying these words?

843



844

00:17:54.06,00:17:56.37

845

What, now you're not even[br]talking to me?

846



847

00:17:59.18,00:18:03.18

848

Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.[br]I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.

849



850

00:18:03.58,00:18:04.90

851

I thought I'd lost you.

852



853

00:18:05.14,00:18:08.02

854

How insane must I have been[br]to do something like this?

855



856

00:18:08.26,00:18:12.14

857

I don't cheat, right?[br]That's not me. I'm not Joey!

858



859

00:18:22.14,00:18:25.50

860

It's 3 a.m. They don't[br]know that I've come home yet.

861



862

00:18:25.74,00:18:28.58

863

You notice how they aren't[br]wondering where I am?

864



865

00:18:29.38,00:18:32.58

866

You know, people can be[br]so self-involved.

867



868

00:18:33.82,00:18:37.70

869

You know what? I'm not the one[br]that wanted that break.

870



871

00:18:37.94,00:18:40.41

872

You're the one that bailed.[br]You're the one. . .

873



874

00:18:40.66,00:18:42.73

875

. . .that ran the moment things[br]got rough.

876



877

00:18:42.94,00:18:44.01

878

-That's--[br]-That's what?

879



880

00:18:44.26,00:18:46.78

881

-That is neither here nor there.[br]-Here we are. . .

882



883

00:18:46.98,00:18:49.02

884

. . .in a spot again.[br]What do you want?

885



886

00:18:49.26,00:18:52.78

887

How do you want to handle it?[br]You want to fight for us or bail?

888



889

00:18:58.46,00:19:02.34

890

Look, I did a terrible,[br]stupid, stupid thing, okay?

891



892

00:19:02.82,00:19:06.21

893

I'm sorry. I wish I could[br]take it back, but I can't.

894



895

00:19:06.66,00:19:10.54

896

I just can't see us throwing away[br]something we know is so damn good.

897



898

00:19:11.54,00:19:13.58

899

I love you so much.

900



901

00:19:23.54,00:19:25.58

902

No, Ross! Don't!

903



904

00:19:25.78,00:19:29.02

905

You can't just kiss me and[br]make it all go away.

906



907

00:19:29.26,00:19:32.65

908

It doesn't work that way.[br]It doesn't just make it better.

909



910

00:19:37.74,00:19:39.66

911

I think you should go.

912



913

00:19:41.14,00:19:41.94

914

What?

915



916

00:19:42.66,00:19:45.18

917

I really think you need to go now.

918



919

00:19:50.14,00:19:53.30

920

This morning you said there was[br]nothing we couldn't work out.

921



922

00:19:53.54,00:19:55.10

923

What the hell did I know?

924



925

00:19:55.34,00:19:58.22

926

There's got to be a way we[br]can work past this.

927



928

00:19:58.46,00:20:01.26

929

I can't imagine my life without you.

930



931

00:20:05.34,00:20:06.41

932

Without these arms. . .

933



934

00:20:07.54,00:20:10.01

935

. . .and your face and heart. . .

936



937

00:20:10.22,00:20:12.22

938

. . .your good heart, Rach, and. . . .

939



940

00:20:18.66,00:20:21.66

941

I can't. You're a totally[br]different person to me now.

942



943

00:20:22.34,00:20:27.21

944

I used to think of you as somebody[br]that would never, ever hurt me.

945



946

00:20:27.46,00:20:28.53

947

Ever.

948



949

00:20:30.14,00:20:32.26

950

Now I can't stop picturing[br]you with her.

951



952

00:20:32.54,00:20:36.01

953

I can't. It doesn't matter what you[br]say or what you do.

954



955

00:20:36.26,00:20:38.73

956

It's just changed everything.

957



958

00:20:41.14,00:20:42.66

959

Forever.

960



961

00:20:53.22,00:20:54.66

962

This can't be it.

963



964

00:20:59.82,00:21:01.86

965

Then how come it is?

966



967

00:21:12.82,00:21:14.89

968

They've been quiet for a long time.

969



970

00:21:16.26,00:21:17.30

971

Maybe she killed him.

972



973

00:21:21.46,00:21:22.61

974

Let's go.

975



976

00:21:49.42,00:21:51.10

977

Is that your new walk?

978



979

00:21:55.46,00:21:57.34

980

I really have to pee.

981
