1
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
Oh, man!

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
- What's that?- Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
What in the name of hell?

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
Maybe he found your flip-flop.

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
Is this porn?

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
I must have hit somethingon the remote.

7
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
Do we pay for this?

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
We didn't even pay our cable bill.

9
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
Maybe this is how they punish us.

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.Free phone sex.

11
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

12
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
Hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

13
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
Joey pressed something on the remoteand it just came on.

14
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
It happened to me once.It was like finding money.

15
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Finding moneywith naked people on it!

16
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
But I made the mistakeof turning off the TV.

17
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
I never got it back again.

18
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
And I'm sad.

19
00:01:03 --> 00:01:05
Why would he turn off the TV?

20
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
The One with the Free Porn

21
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
Do we really have to watch thiswhile we eat?

22
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
We don't knowwhat could make this go away.

23
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
So no one touches the remote,and no one touches the TV.

24
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
And no one touches the airaround the TV.

25
00:02:01 --> 00:02:06
Imagine a protective porn bubble,if you will.

26
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
I'm at least going to mute it.

27
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
We still have porn.

28
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
What are you doing?That's too heavy. Give it here.

29
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
Oh, God.

30
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
I'm too pregnant for luggingaround a stupid massage table.

31
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
I need a job with a smaller table.

32
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
Or a job without a table.

33
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
You mean, like a doctor?

34
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
You're blocking the porn!

35
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
That reminds me.I have to see my ob-gyn today.

36
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
Emily just went to the airport.

37
00:02:50 --> 00:02:51
Why didn't you take her?

38
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
Her uncle had planned to do it.

39
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
We said our goodbyes this morning.

40
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
You must feel horrible.Hey, the guys have free porn.

41
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
Hey, cheer up.You'll see her again, right?

42
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
I don't know.

43
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
When I brought it up, she said...

44
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
..."This is so fantastic.Why talk about the future?"

45
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
- "Let's enjoy..."- Don't do the accent.

46
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
You've got to see her again.

47
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
- Why do you care?- Because!

48
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
You could live out my fantasy.

49
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
You had fantasies about Emily?

50
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
You know, the fantasy.

51
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
Meet a foreigner, fall madly in loveand spend your lives together.

52
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
Is that why you hung outwith that Ukrainian kid in school?

53
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
Yeah, plus his mom used to putsour cream on everything.

54
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
Do you love her?

55
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
We said it wouldonly be two weeks.

56
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
You love her.

57
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
What is love, really?

58
00:03:51 --> 00:03:52
I knew you loved her!

59
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
You go to the airport and tell her.

60
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
You'll probably catch her at the gate.

61
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
You'll call her nameand yell "I love you!"

62
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
She'll say "I love you too!"

63
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
Then you will havethe most amazing kiss.

64
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
Everyone at the gate will applaud.

65
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
I am a good kisser.

66
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
Then you two can sneakinto the cockpit.

67
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
Things will start to heat up.

68
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
And then a stewardess comes in...

69
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
I've been watching too much porn.

70
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
- Is that the heartbeat?- That's it.

71
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Oh, my God!

72
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
This is so cool!

73
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
Have we talked about multiple births?

74
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
Let's take care of this one. If Iget pregnant again, I have your card.

75
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
No, I'm gettingthree separate heartbeats.

76
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
You guys were worriedI wouldn't even have one.

77
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
Doctors are wrong all the time.

78
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
Are you sure that there are three?

79
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
- Definitely.- Oh, my God.

80
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
So in a few months, I'll have threebabies walking around inside me?

81
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
It'll be like one of those log rideswhen they come shooting out.

82
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
Giving birth to threeis like giving birth to one.

83
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
What do you know?

84
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
How'd it go at the doctor's?

85
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
You know how, when you'rewalking down the street...

86
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
...and you see three people in a row.

87
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
And you say "Oh, that's nice."

88
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
Good news!You'll have three babies.

89
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
Three babies?

90
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
I've finally got my band!

91
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
We'll have a big family!I always wanted a big family.

92
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54
I'm so glad you're happy!I was afraid you'd be freaked.

93
00:05:54 --> 00:05:55
Why would we be freaked?

94
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
Because it's harder to raise themand the added expense.

95
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Right.

96
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
No, back to happy.Back to happy!

97
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
It's going to be fine...

98
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
...because I teach home ec.

99
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
I can have 30 kids makingbaby clothes all year long.

100
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
It'll be like my very ownlittle sweatshop.

101
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
I was thinking, ever sinceyou said we'd have triplets.

102
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
The best thing for me to do isdrop out of college and get a job.

103
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
No, you can't quit college.

104
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
You're in college?

105
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
Refrigerator college.

106
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
When we found outwe were having a baby...

107
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
...I figured I should havea career, you know?

108
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
And I love refrigerators.

109
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
You can't give up on your dream!

110
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
No, it's okay.We're going to have three kids.

111
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
And that's a different kind of dream.

112
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
Three kids and no money.

113
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
for flight 009.

114
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
What are you doing here?

115
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
I had to see youbefore you took off.

116
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
You are so sweet.

117
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
That's a big candy bar.

118
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
I had the most amazing time with you.

119
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
Me too.

120
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
for flight 009.

121
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
Well, that's me.

122
00:07:35 --> 00:07:35
Here, have this.

123
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
I'm only allowedone piece of carry-on.

124
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
Listen, I have to tell you something.

125
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
I've been thinking.

126
00:07:47 --> 00:07:50
I'm just going to say it, okay?

127
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
I think...

128
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
...I love you.

129
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
Thank you.

130
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
It's no problem.

131
00:08:18 --> 00:08:19
What is that song?

132
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
It's the themefrom "Good Will Humping".

133
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
You know who doesn't likedirty movies? My boyfriend Joshua.

134
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
Yeah, right.

135
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
He said he prefers to leavecertain things to the imagination.

136
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
Did he also say thatthe dialogue was corny?

137
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
And that he found it funny, not sexy?

138
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
Yeah, he likes porn.

139
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
Where you going?

140
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
To find out if he reallythinks models are too skinny.

141
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
How'd it go?

142
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
Frank has to quit college...

143
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
...because his super-fertilesister's having three babies.

144
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
I need to make money fast.I wanted to talk to you about an idea.

145
00:09:01 --> 00:09:02
You work for a big company.

146
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
Insider trading.

147
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
What information can you give me?

148
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
They don't talk to usabout that stuff.

149
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
But I can get you free White-Out.

150
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
- Did you do what I said?- I did.

151
00:09:16 --> 00:09:17
What'd she say?

152
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
"Thank you."

153
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
You're totally welcome.What'd she say?

154
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
She said, "Thank you."

155
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
I said, "I love you."

156
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
And she said, "Thank you."

157
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
Did you say you love her?

158
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
What were you tryingto get her to do?

159
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
What do I do?

160
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
You play hard-to-get.

161
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
She already lives in London.

162
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
So you go to Tokyo.

163
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
Forget it.

164
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
You told her you love her.It's over.

165
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
It is not over!You're over!

166
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
What?

167
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
You know.

168
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
Good one.

169
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
It's not over. She'll calland tell you she loves you.

170
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
Her feelings were so strongthat it scared her.

171
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
Go home and wait for her call.She could call from the plane.

172
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
But if she doesn't call,it is definitely over!

173
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
Unless, eventually, I call herto see what's going on...

174
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
...and she says she'll call me back,but then she doesn't.

175
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
Then it's over!

176
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
Way to be strong!

177
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
Can we watch cartoons on your TV?

178
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
We need a porn break.

179
00:10:42 --> 00:10:47
In and Out and In Again.

180
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
Why don't you turn it off?

181
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
Then we'd be the guyswho turned off free porn.

182
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
Good, you're here!

183
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
What you got there?

184
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
This? I'm glad you asked.

185
00:11:01 --> 00:11:06
Don't you hate to cut a tin canwith an ordinary steak knife?

186
00:11:08 --> 00:11:09
I know what you're thinking.

187
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
Pregnant woman slays four?

188
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
Did they make you payfor those knives?

189
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
You sure?

190
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
You won't make enough moneyby selling knives.

191
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
I just need enough moneyfor the second part of my plan.

192
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
What's that?

193
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
My Saturn dealership.

194
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
How was your flight?

195
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
It was dreadful.

196
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
It was terrible how I actedwhen you said those wonderful things.

197
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
No, that's all right.

198
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
I'm just glad you called.

199
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
that I've got to tell you.

200
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
There's someone else.

201
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
Does that mean the same thingin England as it does in America?

202
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
She doesn't know who she wants.Me or this "Colin" guy.

203
00:12:10 --> 00:12:15
This isn't how it's supposed to go.There can't be another guy.

204
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
Of course, there's another guy!

205
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
This is even more perfect.

206
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
You have to prove your love!

207
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
I'm not proving anything.I'm done listening to you.

208
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
If I hadn't let you talk meinto this...

209
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
...I wouldn't have put my fistthrough the wall.

210
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
You did that?

211
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
I missed and hit the door.

212
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
But it opened really hard.

213
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
You have to go to London.You have to go fight for her.

214
00:12:40 --> 00:12:41
That makes sense.

215
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
You said you loved her,and she didn't say it back.

216
00:12:44 --> 00:12:49
Then she told you about another guy.Go to London. Scare her!

217
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
When Rachel was with Paolo,what did you do?

218
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
I made fun of his accent.

219
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
You sat back and let him have her.You didn't fight.

220
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
You want that to happen with Emily?

221
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
Go fight for her!Go to London.

222
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
That could be you and Emily.

223
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
That but nicer.

224
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
Go to London!

225
00:13:11 --> 00:13:11
Really?

226
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
Surprise her.Don't let her go without a fight.

227
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
All right. I'm going to do it.

228
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
I'm going to London,and I'll fight for her.

229
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Okay. Good luck!

230
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
Can you pick me up oneof those Toblerone bars at the airport?

231
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
I did it!I figured out a way to make money.

232
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
I'll open a massage place.Frank will help me.

233
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
We'll work it around his schedule,so he doesn't have to quit school.

234
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
But how can you afford it?

235
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
We were walking down the street,and we saw your van.

236
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
- And we realized...- I'm telling it!

237
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
People need transportation,and they need massages to relax.

238
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
We can combine the two.I give massages and Frank drives.

239
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
I'll bolt a table in the van,and you know what I've got?

240
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
A place that no onewill get out of alive?

241
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
Think about it. It's a taxi thatpeople take when they need to relax.

242
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
It's a Relaxi-Taxi!

243
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
The name was my favorite part!

244
00:14:17 --> 00:14:18
I came up with it.

245
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
You did not!

246
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
You came up with Relaxi-Cab.That's not good.

247
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
Oh, my god! Are you in England?Was Emily surprised?

248
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
No, she hasn't come home yet.

249
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
She hasn't been home all night.She must be with the other guy.

250
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
I'm the stupid moronwho spent the night here.

251
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
When is the next flight out?

252
00:14:42 --> 00:14:43
About four hours.

253
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
If she doesn't show up, come home.

254
00:14:47 --> 00:14:48
Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

255
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
Ask him if he likes itbetter than Relaxi-Cab.

256
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
It's not Relaxi-Cab.It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.

257
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
That is better.

258
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
Are we in London?

259
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
Why are you here?You can't be here.

260
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
I've come to talk to Ross.

261
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
What?

262
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
Nothing.

263
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
I was going to call him...

264
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
You came to tell him you love him.I knew it!

265
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
I was right!I'm right, right?

266
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
I'd rather talk to him.

267
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
I've been to his apartmentand he's not there.

268
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
I need to talk to him.Do you know where he is?

269
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
Ross, are you there?

270
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
but I'll talk anyway.

271
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
I'm in the Stateswith your sister and friends.

272
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
It's all over with Colin.

273
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
and to tell you...

274
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
all the chocolate you want.

275
00:16:01 --> 00:16:06
I came here to tell youthat I love you.

276
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
I love you too!

277
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
I'll call you right nowfrom the phone booth.

278
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
You can't hear me.

279
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
I wish I knew if you'd heard me.

280
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
I suppose I've givenmy neighbors a good laugh.

281
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,bugger off. None of your business.

282
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
There's not much chanceyou did hear that.

283
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
There's the call waiting...

284
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
...so I should go.

285
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
Ross, I love you.

286
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
Thank you.

287
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
There was this really hot tellerat the bank.

288
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
And she didn't ask meto do it with her in the vault.

289
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
Same thing happened to me.

290
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
Pizza delivery girl comes over,gives me the pizza and leaves!

291
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
No "Nice apartment,bet the bedrooms are huge"?

292
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
Nothing!

293
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
You know what?We have to turn off the porn.

294
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
I think you're right.

295
00:17:16 --> 00:17:16
Ready?

296
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
One, two, three.

297
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
That's kind of nice.

298
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
That's kind of a relief.

299
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
You want to seeif we still have it?

300
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
- Free porn!- We have free porn!
