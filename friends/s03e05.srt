No, but he's always late.

57



58

00:01:54.58,00:01:56.86

59

-I thought you only met him once.[br]-I did.

60



61

00:01:58.46,00:02:01.77

62

I think it sounds big sister-y,[br]"Frank's always late. "

63



64

00:02:02.70,00:02:04.82

65

Well, relax. He'll be here.

68

I know.[br]I' m just nervous.

69



70

00:02:06.98,00:02:10.06

92

All right. Janice likes him.

93



94

00:02:37.06,00:02:40.82

95

In fact, she likes him so much,[br]she put him on her "freebie" Iist.

96



97

00:02:44.30,00:02:45.13

98

Her what?

99



100

00:02:45.38,00:02:50.01

You do realize that she is a cartoon,[br]and way out of your league?

129



130

00:03:16.98,00:03:20.82

131

I know. I just wonder if I could[br]get her eyes to pop out of her head.

132



133

00:03:22.38,00:03:23.86

134

Who would yours be?

What about you, honey?[br]Who'd be on your list?

162



163

00:03:52.30,00:03:55.38

164

That kind of thing[br]requires some serious thought.

165



166

00:03:55.58,00:03:59.13

167

First, I'd divide my prospective[br]candidates into categories.

00:04:27.42,00:04:28.90

194

We don't, really.

195



196

00:04:30.58,00:04:32.26

201



202

00:04:36.42,00:04:40.94

I thought we could go down to Times[br]Square and pick up some ninja stars.

204



205

00:04:41.18,00:04:45.02

206

My friend, Larry, he wants me[br]to take a picture of a hooker.

207



208

00:04:46.62,00:04:49.42

209

We really don't take advantage[br]of living in the city.

210



211

00:05:03.30,00:05:05.21

212

Oh, sorry. Did I get you?

213



214

00:05:06.62,00:05:07.82

215

No, you didn't "get" me!

216



217

00:05:08.06,00:05:09.21

218

It's an electric drill!

219



220

00:05:09.42,00:05:11.22

221

You "get" me, you kill me!

222



223

00:05:12.30,00:05:14.45

224

Calm down![br]Do you want this unit or not?

225



226

00:05:14.90,00:05:17.05

227

I do not want this unit!

228



229

00:05:17.30,00:05:20.18

230

You should've told me before.[br]I' m not a mind reader.

231



232

00:05:21.90,00:05:24.82

233

And we' re out of beer.[br]I' m going to Monica's.

242

I saw down at the hardware store, they[br]got those designer tiles on sale. . .

243



244

00:05:42.38,00:05:44.61

245

. . .if you wanna redo[br]your bathroom floor.

246



247

00:05:45.06,00:05:47.02

248

What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

249



250

00:05:47.22,00:05:49.98

251

Nothing. It's just old and dingy,[br]that's all.

252



253

00:05:50.90,00:05:52.34

254

I highly doubt that.

255



256

00:05:54.22,00:05:56.66

257

If you move your hamper. . .

258



259

00:05:56.90,00:05:58.70

260

. . .you see how[br]the tile used to be.

261



262

00:06:02.22,00:06:04.86

263

I can't live like this![br]What are we gonna do?

264



265

00:06:05.10,00:06:06.46

266

Relax. Here, hold this.

267



268

00:06:06.70,00:06:09.42

269

This old stuff comes right up.[br]I'll show you.

270



271

00:06:11.90,00:06:14.02

272

A little more than I wanted to see.

273



274

00:06:16.98,00:06:19.82

275

Look at that![br]Every inch of this is glued down!

276



277

00:06:20.02,00:06:23.41

278

It'd take forever to pry this up.[br]You should just leave it.

279



280

00:06:25.26,00:06:29.62

281

I can't leave it! You gouged[br]a hole in my dingy floor!

282



283

00:06:37.90,00:06:39.62

284

There. There you go.

285



286

00:06:40.74,00:06:41.86

287

Yeah, that's nice.

288



289

00:06:42.10,00:06:45.62

290

We can put it back there after the[br]surgeons remove it from your colon!

291



292

00:06:55.02,00:06:58.22

293

I know what I wanted to ask you.[br]Can you roll your tongue?

294



295

00:06:59.18,00:07:01.74

296

Because I can and my mom couldn't.

297



298

00:07:01.98,00:07:05.50

299

And I figured that was[br]something I got from our dad.

300



301

00:07:05.74,00:07:08.02

302

Well, wait, you mean like this?

303



304

00:07:09.14,00:07:11.21

305

Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

306



307

00:07:12.46,00:07:13.61

308

You' re not doing it.

309



310

00:07:14.06,00:07:17.21

311

Oh, right. Okay.[br]Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

312



313

00:07:18.62,00:07:20.34

314

We don't have that.

315

Celebrities I' m allowed to sleep with.

349

00:08:06.18,00:08:08.25

350

God, you' re giving this[br]a lot of thought.

351



352

00:08:08.50,00:08:11.02

353

Hey, it's hard, okay?[br]I only have two spots left.

368

Susan Sarandon.

369



370

00:08:24.62,00:08:26.61

371

You know what? She's too political.

372



373

00:08:26.82,00:08:30.10

374

She'd probably make you donate[br]four cans of food first.

375



376

00:08:32.66,00:08:35.22

377

And lsabella Rossellini.

381



382

00:08:36.86,00:08:41.41

384



385

00:08:41.90,00:08:44.05

386

-So?[br]-So you gotta play the odds.

387

392

Yeah. Because that's why you won't[br]get lsabella Rossellini. Geography.

393



394

00:09:02.02,00:09:04.74

395

Okay. So by "melting"[br]you meant melting.

00:10:09.74,00:10:13.34

437

-How's it going with you guys?[br]-So far it kind of blows.

438



439

00:10:17.26,00:10:20.62

440

I don't know, I just thought[br]he'd feel more like a brother.

441



442

00:10:20.82,00:10:23.05

443

Like you and Ross.[br]Close and connected and. . . .

444



445

00:10:23.30,00:10:25.74

446

We' re close now.[br]You wouldn't believe the years. . .

447



448

00:10:25.98,00:10:30.58

449

. . .of noogies, and wedgies, and flying[br]wedgies, and atomic wedgies and. . . .

450



451

00:10:32.06,00:10:34.62

452

That's when the waistband[br]goes over your head.

453



454

00:10:37.54,00:10:39.69

455

We drove each other crazy[br]playing the shadow game.

456



457

00:10:39.98,00:10:42.66

458

-How do you play the shadow game?[br]-How do you play the shadow game?

459



460

00:10:42.90,00:10:44.94

461

-I just asked you.[br]-I just asked you.

462



463

00:10:45.18,00:10:47.01

464

I don't have time for this.

465



466

00:10:47.34,00:10:50.81

467

-That is what the game is.[br]-You just gave up really quickly.

468



469

00:10:53.46,00:10:55.02

470

-Seen Joey?[br]-What's the matter?

471



472

00:10:55.22,00:10:57.13

473

Oh, just this!

474



475

00:11:02.30,00:11:06.62

476

It's my fault, really, because the[br]couch is where we keep the varnish.

477



478

00:11:08.58,00:11:10.78

479

Somebody wanna hand me[br]one of those tiles?

480



481

00:11:13.18,00:11:15.74

482

-What's going on?[br]-He's retiling my floor.

483



484

00:11:16.90,00:11:18.18

485

Spackle boy!

486



487

00:11:19.50,00:11:22.38

488

-Get up![br]-You started this, you'll finish it!

489



490

00:11:22.82,00:11:24.26

491

He started mine first!

492



493

00:11:24.50,00:11:27.26

494

Build the unit, Cinderellie[br]Lay the tile, Cinderellie

495



496

00:11:32.38,00:11:34.06

497

Big octopus.

498



499

00:11:42.46,00:11:44.74

500

Oh, my God! I totally forgot!

501



502

00:11:45.38,00:11:47.29

503

Well, can't someone else do it?

504



505

00:11:47.86,00:11:49.34

506

But I have company.

507



508

00:11:52.78,00:11:55.22

509

Look, that's all right.[br]I'll come in.

510



511

00:11:56.46,00:11:58.82

512

I' m sorry,[br]but I have to go into work.

513



514

00:11:59.02,00:12:02.41

515

It's one of my regulars who's[br]insisting that I do him, so. . . .

516



517

00:12:02.66,00:12:04.89

518

Hey, what kind of work do you do?

519



520

00:12:05.46,00:12:06.45

521

I' m a masseuse.

522



523

00:12:06.70,00:12:08.66

524

I give people massages and stuff.

525



526

00:12:08.90,00:12:12.50

527

You work at one of[br]those massage parlors?

528



529

00:12:13.58,00:12:16.73

530

Well, you know, we don't call it that.[br]But, yeah.

531



532

00:12:19.90,00:12:21.86

533

That's wild.

534



535

00:12:22.10,00:12:23.93

536

No, I had no idea.

537



538

00:12:24.18,00:12:25.33

539

Alrighty.

540



541

00:12:26.90,00:12:28.42

542

I'll be back in a little bit.

543



544

00:12:28.62,00:12:30.42

545

Unless you want to come with me.

546



547

00:12:30.66,00:12:32.46

548

You mean, like, watch?

549



550

00:12:33.42,00:12:37.34

551

No. No, you can get one yourself.[br]It'll be on the house.

552



553

00:12:37.58,00:12:39.49

554

What are big sisters for?

555



556

00:12:39.98,00:12:42.62

557

Well, I don't think this. You know?

558



559

00:12:43.02,00:12:45.01

560

No. No, no.[br]I wouldn't do you myself.

561



562

00:12:45.22,00:12:46.94

563

I mean, that would be weird.

564



565

00:12:48.38,00:12:50.58

566

I'll get one of the[br]other girls to do it.

567



568

00:12:50.78,00:12:52.34

569

This is so much fun!

570



571

00:12:54.18,00:12:55.62

572

Are you excited?

573



574

00:12:57.98,00:13:00.50

575

Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?

576



577

00:13:02.94,00:13:04.62

578

It's beautiful!

579



580

00:13:04.90,00:13:07.82

581

It's like the first bathroom[br]floor there ever was!

582



583

00:13:10.10,00:13:12.22

584

What are you going in there for?

585



586

00:13:12.46,00:13:14.37

587

You want, like, a number?

588



589

00:13:18.46,00:13:20.02

590

Hi. Bye.

591



592

00:13:21.50,00:13:24.02

593

Okay. I' m done with my choices.

594



595

00:13:24.22,00:13:25.82

596

These are final.

597



598

00:13:27.50,00:13:30.26

599

-Well, it's about time.[br]-Yeah. very official.

600



601

00:13:30.50,00:13:34.62

602

Oh, yeah. Well, you know, Chandler[br]printed it up on his computer.

603



604

00:13:34.86,00:13:36.14

605

And who laminated it?

606



607

00:13:38.10,00:13:39.46

608

That was me.

609



610

00:13:40.26,00:13:41.49

611

All right, let me see.

612



613

00:13:42.42,00:13:46.05

614

"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,[br]Elizabeth Hurley. . .

615



616

00:13:46.30,00:13:47.58

617

. . .Michelle Pfeiffer. . .

618



619

00:13:48.62,00:13:50.30

620

. . .Dorothy Hamill"?

621



622

00:13:55.78,00:13:57.14

623

Hey, it's my list!

624



625

00:13:58.34,00:14:01.81

626

You do realize she only spins[br]like that on ice?

627



628

00:14:10.70,00:14:13.06

629

-What's going on?[br]-She broke my arm!

630



631

00:14:13.30,00:14:15.82

632

-He touched my fanny.[br]-She touched mine first!

633



634

00:14:16.02,00:14:17.46

635

That's my job!

636



637

00:14:17.70,00:14:21.14

638

So what's the deal? I can have sex[br]with you but I can't touch you?

639



640

00:14:22.94,00:14:26.09

641

-You can't have sex with her![br]-Did you think I was a hooker?

642



643

00:14:26.34,00:14:29.65

644

No, okay. I know. You' re a masseuse.[br]It's cool. I' m not a cop!

645



646

00:14:32.90,00:14:35.82

647

Ask Mr. Wiffler if he[br]can wait for five minutes.

648



649

00:14:36.02,00:14:37.42

650

Fine.

651



652

00:14:37.62,00:14:38.98

653

I don't like you.

654



655

00:14:40.90,00:14:43.90

656

So that's what you thought I did?[br]God!

657



658

00:14:44.98,00:14:46.66

659

That's not what I do!

660



661

00:14:47.10,00:14:49.94

662

Wait, that's not what you do?

663



664

00:14:50.18,00:14:51.33

665

No!

666



667

00:14:52.18,00:14:53.70

668

Why would you think that?

669



670

00:14:53.90,00:14:57.10

671

I don't know. This is the city,[br]you know? I just. . . .

672



673

00:14:57.34,00:14:58.54

674

I mean. . .

675



676

00:14:58.78,00:15:00.10

677

. . .I don't know.

678



679

00:15:01.62,00:15:05.33

680

Whatever. It's the perfect end[br]to the perfect weekend anyway.

681



682

00:15:06.66,00:15:07.73

683

Oh, wait.

684



685

00:15:07.98,00:15:10.62

686

No, you' re right.[br]No, it was perfect.

687



688

00:15:11.70,00:15:14.09

689

I can't believe[br]I screwed it up so bad.

690



691

00:15:15.90,00:15:17.34

692

You thought it was perfect?

693



694

00:15:17.58,00:15:19.65

695

Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect. . .

696



697

00:15:19.90,00:15:22.26

698

. . .but you know, it was pretty cool,[br]you know?

699



700

00:15:22.50,00:15:25.02

701

Because we had all those[br]great talks, you know?

702



703

00:15:29.70,00:15:32.34

704

Which ones in particular[br]were great for you?

705



706

00:15:33.26,00:15:35.82

707

Well, you know, about[br]the tongue thing, you know?

708



709

00:15:36.02,00:15:39.49

710

And how I told you about[br]my likes and my dislikes.

711



712

00:15:41.10,00:15:44.70

713

How I like to melt stuff, and how[br]I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

714



715

00:15:46.98,00:15:48.34

716

Right. Okay.

717



718

00:15:49.30,00:15:54.22

719

I feel like I can really talk to you[br]because you' re my sister, you know?

720



721

00:15:56.66,00:15:59.10

722

Yeah. I guess I do.

723



724

00:15:59.34,00:16:01.98

725

And then I go feel your friend up[br]and make you mad at me.

726



727

00:16:04.26,00:16:07.14

728

Well, I wasn't hopping mad,[br]you know?

729



730

00:16:08.10,00:16:09.78

731

You hopped a little bit.

732



733

00:16:12.06,00:16:15.18

734

Yeah, I' m really sorry.[br]You know, I' m really. . . .

735



736

00:16:16.10,00:16:17.22

737

Okay.

738



739

00:16:19.50,00:16:23.02

740

Well, this is my favorite part[br]of the weekend. Right now. This.

741



742

00:16:23.22,00:16:24.29

743

This?

744



745

00:16:25.10,00:16:27.41

746

Oh, come on. We went to Times Square.

747



748

00:16:27.66,00:16:30.62

749

We found ninja stars. I almost[br]get my arm broken by a hooker--

750



751

00:16:30.82,00:16:32.22

752

She's not a hooker.

753



754

00:16:32.70,00:16:34.90

755

When I tell my friends about her,[br]she will be.

756



757

00:16:41.98,00:16:42.89

758

On 3!

759



760

00:16:43.10,00:16:44.90

761

1 , 2--

762



763

00:16:45.14,00:16:46.70

764

Why don't we just go on 2?

765



766

00:16:46.90,00:16:47.81

767

Why 2?

768



769

00:16:48.02,00:16:49.42

770

Because it's faster.

771



772

00:16:49.62,00:16:52.77

773

I could've counted to 3 four times[br]without all the "2" talk.

774



775

00:16:53.18,00:16:57.46

776

-All right, but in the future--[br]-Heavy thing! Not getting lighter!

777



778

00:16:58.38,00:16:59.78

779

1 , 2--

780



781

00:16:59.98,00:17:02.02

782

So we are going with two?

783



784

00:17:10.86,00:17:12.38

785

A good job, Joe.

786



787

00:17:13.62,00:17:14.58

788

Wow.

789



790

00:17:15.30,00:17:16.26

791

It's big.

792



793

00:17:18.18,00:17:20.82

794

So big it actually makes[br]our doors look smaller.

795



796

00:17:21.74,00:17:23.02

797

Maybe my ruler's wrong.

798



799

00:17:23.22,00:17:25.61

800

Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

801



802

00:17:26.30,00:17:30.62

803

It's not that bad. So it blocks a[br]little of your door, a little of mine.

804



805

00:17:30.82,00:17:31.81

806

I got a better idea.

807



808

00:17:32.06,00:17:35.45

809

How about it blocks none of my door,[br]and a lot of your door?

810



811

00:17:38.58,00:17:41.73

812

Listen, before I forget,[br]that side is still wet.

813



814

00:17:46.06,00:17:48.05

815

Let me just see[br]if I've got this right.

816



817

00:17:48.30,00:17:51.61

818

So this is a half-caf, double-tall,[br]easy hazelnut. . .

819



820

00:17:51.82,00:17:56.58

821

. . .nonfat, no foam, with whip,[br]extra-hot latte, right?

822



823

00:17:56.78,00:17:58.18

824

Okay. Great.

825



826

00:17:58.86,00:18:00.46

827

You freak.

828



829

00:18:06.22,00:18:07.18

830

Thank you.

831



832

00:18:07.42,00:18:09.06

833

A coffee to go, please.

834



835

00:18:13.10,00:18:14.42

836

Isabella Rossellini!

837



838

00:18:14.66,00:18:17.18

839

Are you serious? Oh, my God!

840



841

00:18:17.38,00:18:20.69

842

Damn! I cannot believe[br]I took her off my list!

843



844

00:18:20.94,00:18:23.78

845

Why? Because otherwise[br]you'd go for it?

846



847

00:18:25.70,00:18:27.38

848

Yeah, maybe.

849



850

00:18:27.82,00:18:29.14

851

You lie.

852



853

00:18:29.90,00:18:31.66

854

You don't think I'd go up to her?

855



856

00:18:31.90,00:18:35.45

857

It took you 1 0 years to finally admit[br]you liked me.

858



859

00:18:37.42,00:18:42.34

860

Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad[br]that list is laminated.

921



922

00:19:56.42,00:19:57.38

923
