00:00:08.72,00:00:10.12

17

What's so funny?

18



19

00:00:10.32,00:00:14.23

20

Nothing. It's an acting exercise.[br]I'm practicing my fake laugh.

21



22

00:00:19.12,00:00:21.00

23

What? What's so funny?

24



25

00:00:24.72,00:00:26.95

26

No, no. There's none of that in here.

27



28

00:00:27.20,00:00:30.16

29

Come on. At least let me[br]finish this last one.

30



31

00:00:31.28,00:00:33.03

32

Only if you give me a drag.

33



34

00:00:41.40,00:00:44.60

35

Oh, dark mother, once again[br]I suckle at your smoky teat.

36



37

00:00:47.64,00:00:49.71

38

Why don't you hold on to that one.

39



40

00:00:58.88,00:01:01.63

41

That's like the least fun game ever.

42



43

00:01:01.88,00:01:04.63

44

I'm sick of your smoking,[br]so I brought something. . .

45



46

00:01:04.88,00:01:07.31

47

. . .that is going to help you quit.

48



49

00:01:13.72,00:01:15.12

50

That patch is no good.

51



52

00:01:19.36,00:01:20.92

53

It's a hypnosis tape.

54



55

00:01:21.12,00:01:24.63

56

A woman at work used it for two weeks[br]and hasn't smoked since.

57



58

00:01:27.72,00:01:29.04

59

What's your problem?

60



61

00:01:29.28,00:01:32.91

62

Nothing. It's just that[br]hypnosis is beyond crap.

63



64

00:01:34.28,00:01:36.71

65

I watched you get hypnotized[br]in Atlantic City.

66



67

00:01:36.96,00:01:39.27

68

That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

69



70

00:01:39.52,00:01:43.31

71

You always pull your pants down[br]and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.

72



73

00:01:45.36,00:01:46.51

74

Forget hypnosis.

75



76

00:01:46.76,00:01:50.23

77

The way to quit smoking is to[br]dance naked in a field of heather. . .

78



79

00:01:50.48,00:01:53.52

80

. . .and then bathe in the sweat[br]of six healthy, young men.

81



82

00:01:54.60,00:01:57.67

83

Or what my father calls[br]"Thursday night. "

91

00:02:44.92,00:02:47.96

92

-Here you go.[br]-I didn't want cinnamon on this.

93



94

00:02:48.20,00:02:49.52

95

Sorry.

96



97

00:02:57.36,00:02:59.03

98

Oh, my God! Frank!

99



100

00:03:00.56,00:03:01.67

101

How are you?

102



103

00:03:01.92,00:03:03.51

104

What are you doing here?

105



106

00:03:03.76,00:03:06.32

107

I would've called,[br]but I lost your number.

108



109

00:03:06.52,00:03:10.59

110

And then my mom locked me out of[br]the house, so I couldn't find it.

111



112

00:03:11.00,00:03:15.15

113

Then I tried to find a pay phone,[br]and the receiver was cut off.

114



115

00:03:16.72,00:03:18.28

116

What happened?

117



118

00:03:19.28,00:03:20.79

119

vandalism.

120



121

00:03:21.92,00:03:24.59

122

But also, what happened[br]between you and your mom?

123



124

00:03:25.16,00:03:29.12

125

We got in a fight. She said that[br]I was too immature to get married.

126



127

00:03:29.36,00:03:31.32

128

You're getting married?

129



130

00:03:33.96,00:03:36.31

131

My little brother's getting married!

132



133

00:03:37.12,00:03:41.19

134

I knew you'd be so cool about this.[br]Do you wanna meet her?

135



136

00:03:41.44,00:03:42.55

137

Do l?

138



139

00:03:43.00,00:03:44.15

140

Do you?

141



142

00:03:45.12,00:03:46.11

143

Yeah, I do.

144



145

00:03:46.36,00:03:49.56

146

Cool, all right.[br]She's just parking the truck.

147



148

00:03:50.32,00:03:53.31

149

I gonna go get my fiancée, man!

150



151

00:03:56.00,00:04:00.12

152

I'd have bet good money that he'd be[br]the first one of us to get married.

153



154

00:04:00.56,00:04:02.04

155

Isn't it fantastic?

156



157

00:04:02.36,00:04:05.27

158

Don't you think he's[br]a little young to get married?

159



160

00:04:05.52,00:04:06.47

161

Well, he's 1 8.

162



163

00:04:06.72,00:04:10.03

164

It'll be illegal for him to drink[br]at his own bachelor party.

165



166

00:04:10.60,00:04:12.83

167

Yeah, or to get a hooker.

168



169

00:04:13.68,00:04:15.83

170

Always illegal, Joe.

171



172

00:04:18.20,00:04:20.76

173

This is my fiancée. . .

174



175

00:04:20.96,00:04:22.31

176

. . .Mrs. Knight.

177



178

00:04:24.88,00:04:25.71

179

That's my sister.

180



181

00:04:25.92,00:04:27.43

182

You know, it's funny.

183



184

00:04:27.68,00:04:31.67

185

Frank told me so much about you, but[br]you're not how I pictured you at all.

186



187

00:04:32.28,00:04:34.55

188

Yeah, I'm a big surprise.

189



190

00:04:36.40,00:04:37.63

191

Here, grab a seat.

192



193

00:04:37.88,00:04:40.31

194

So how did you guys meet?

195



196

00:04:40.56,00:04:43.12

197

I was in Mrs. Knight's. . . .

198



199

00:04:43.32,00:04:47.15

200

I mean, Alice. Sorry.[br]I always do that.

201



202

00:04:49.16,00:04:50.96

203

I was in her home-ec class.

204



205

00:04:51.20,00:04:52.55

206

He was my best student.

207



208

00:04:52.80,00:04:54.92

209

She was my best teacher.

210



211

00:05:04.12,00:05:06.84

212

If that doesn't keep kids in school,[br]what will?

213



214

00:05:09.36,00:05:12.64

215

And so now you guys[br]are gonna be married?

216



217

00:05:13.16,00:05:16.95

218

We talked about[br]just living together. . .

219



220

00:05:18.20,00:05:20.03

221

. . .but we want kids right away.

222



223

00:05:22.40,00:05:24.12

224

Oh, my God!

225



226

00:05:24.76,00:05:26.16

227

Great!

228



229

00:05:27.64,00:05:30.68

230

Kids. Frank, are you sure[br]you're ready for that?

231



232

00:05:31.20,00:05:32.71

233

How hard can it be?

234



235

00:05:32.96,00:05:37.03

236

You know, I mean, babies.[br]Who doesn't want babies? Right?

237



238

00:05:38.32,00:05:40.51

239

And besides,[br]I never had a dad around.

240



241

00:05:40.72,00:05:44.43

242

And now I always will,[br]because it'll be me.

243



244

00:05:47.96,00:05:51.55

245

Really, we do realize that there's[br]an age difference between us.

246



247

00:05:51.76,00:05:54.27

248

Good. Because you were[br]acting like you didn't.

249



250

00:05:54.60,00:05:58.31

251

But when it comes to love,[br]what does age matter?

252



253

00:06:04.72,00:06:07.31

254

You are falling fast asleep.

255



256

00:06:07.60,00:06:10.19

257

Deeper, deeper, deeper.

258



259

00:06:10.64,00:06:12.95

260

You are now completely asleep.

261



262

00:06:13.20,00:06:15.32

263

You don 't need to smoke.

264



265

00:06:15.56,00:06:18.03

266

Cigarettes don 't control you.

267



268

00:06:18.28,00:06:21.27

269

You are a strong, confident woman...

270



271

00:06:21.52,00:06:23.91

272

... who does not need to smoke.

273



274

00:06:24.16,00:06:26.80

275

A strong, confident woman.

276



277

00:06:29.20,00:06:30.00

278

You know what?

279



280

00:06:30.24,00:06:34.07

281

I realized in the last year I've[br]only gone out with Richard and Julio.

282



283

00:06:34.56,00:06:37.71

284

You gotta help me out, set me up.[br]Get me back in the game.

285



286

00:06:37.96,00:06:38.95

287

Not a problem.

288



289

00:06:39.20,00:06:42.71

290

I work in fashion, and all I meet[br]are eligible straight men.

291



292

00:06:45.44,00:06:46.92

293

Can I get you something else?

294



295

00:06:47.16,00:06:49.83

296

Cheesecake and a date,[br]if you're giving them out.

297



298

00:06:50.88,00:06:52.20

299

Haven't we covered that topic?

300



301

00:06:52.40,00:06:53.96

302

You just said to her--

303



304

00:06:54.20,00:06:55.76

305

You wanna go out with me. . .

306



307

00:06:55.96,00:06:59.16

308

. . .because of my wig, the big boobs,[br]and I serve you food.

309



310

00:06:59.36,00:07:01.75

311

If that were true,[br]I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

312



313

00:07:03.56,00:07:06.52

314

And the two times we went out,[br]it was plain awkward.

315



316

00:07:07.56,00:07:10.31

317

You think she should go out with me,[br]don't you?

318



319

00:07:13.88,00:07:15.76

320

You sure you wanna go out with her?

321



322

00:07:15.96,00:07:18.00

323

That ain't a pretty picture[br]in the morning.

324



325

00:07:19.00,00:07:23.44

326

That wig all in disarray,[br]and boobs flung over the nightstand.

327



328

00:07:24.96,00:07:26.23

329

Think about it.

330



331

00:07:26.44,00:07:27.35

332

Oh, I will.

333



334

00:07:30.12,00:07:33.19

335

No, I know.[br]I know that this is Frank's life.

336



337

00:07:35.08,00:07:38.39

338

I don't wanna be judgmental,[br]but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!

339



340

00:07:39.80,00:07:41.60

341

What, is it the age thing?

342



343

00:07:41.84,00:07:43.51

344

I'm fine with the age thing. . .

345



346

00:07:43.72,00:07:46.71

347

. . .until it sticks its tongue[br]down my brother's throat.

348



349

00:07:48.20,00:07:50.43

350

Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

351



352

00:07:51.24,00:07:54.71

353

You think he'll enjoy it when he's[br]up to his elbows in diapers. . .

354



355

00:07:54.96,00:07:57.71

356

. . .of all the babies[br]they have to have right away?

357



358

00:07:58.48,00:08:02.23

359

This is not fair to Frank,[br]and it's not fair to the babies.

360



361

00:08:02.48,00:08:04.95

362

You know what?[br]It's not good home economics.

363



364

00:08:07.40,00:08:09.44

365

Have you told him how you feel?

366



367

00:08:09.64,00:08:11.95

368

Yes. Not out loud.

369



370

00:08:13.12,00:08:17.19

371

If you don't tell him, soon he'll be[br]married, then you'll hate yourself.

372



373

00:08:17.44,00:08:20.72

374

Yeah, but if I do tell him,[br]then he's gonna hate myself.

375



376

00:08:21.36,00:08:24.32

377

Look at him and his mom.[br]I can't.

378



379

00:08:26.32,00:08:28.59

380

But you guys can.[br]You talk him out of it.

381



382

00:08:31.00,00:08:32.64

383

Come on, you guys.

384



385

00:08:34.32,00:08:36.96

386

You have nothing to lose.[br]I have everything to lose.

387



388

00:08:37.20,00:08:39.51

389

Do you want me to lose everything?[br]Everything?

390



391

00:08:44.72,00:08:46.63

392

Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.

393



394

00:08:49.20,00:08:52.32

395

We're walking down the street,[br]and I turn to you and say:

396



397

00:08:52.56,00:08:55.55

398

"Let's go hang out at[br]Totally Nude Nudes. " Remember?

399



400

00:08:55.80,00:08:59.16

401

And then you say, "Let's just[br]hang out at your place. "

402



403

00:08:59.40,00:09:01.83

404

Well, that was a nice move, dumb ass.

405



406

00:09:03.40,00:09:05.71

407

I think you should[br]go out with this guy.

408



409

00:09:05.96,00:09:07.63

410

He doesn't do anything for me.

411



412

00:09:07.88,00:09:11.92

413

Last Saturday night, what happened[br]on Walker, Texas Ranger?

414



415

00:09:12.16,00:09:16.12

416

Walker was looking for[br]this big busload of kids.

417



418

00:09:17.00,00:09:18.72

419

All right, I get your point.

420



421

00:09:21.20,00:09:24.16

422

I forgot the combination to this[br]about a year ago.

423



424

00:09:24.40,00:09:26.04

425

I just carry it around.

426



427

00:09:28.08,00:09:29.51

428

You got any Chap Stick?

429



430

00:09:30.52,00:09:32.11

431

How are those tapes working out?

432



433

00:09:32.32,00:09:34.67

434

Good. I haven't smoked yet today.

435



436

00:09:34.92,00:09:39.07

437

I feel great and confident.[br]That is a stunning blouse.

438



439

00:09:42.32,00:09:43.15

440

Thank you.

441



442

00:09:44.32,00:09:45.51

443

-Here you go.[br]-Thanks.

444



445

00:09:46.80,00:09:50.43

446

Let's give Pete a chance.[br]He was funny. He seems really nice.

447



448

00:09:50.68,00:09:52.48

449

That check thing was adorable.

450



451

00:09:52.68,00:09:54.16

452

What check thing?

453



454

00:09:54.40,00:09:59.31

455

As a joke, this customer who has a[br]crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.

456



457

00:09:59.56,00:10:02.15

458

His number's on the check.[br]He did it so I'd call.

459



460

00:10:02.36,00:10:04.11

461

Pete Becker. Pete--

462



463

00:10:11.12,00:10:12.07

464

Is this him?

465



466

00:10:12.68,00:10:13.79

467

That's Bill Clinton.

468



469

00:10:16.00,00:10:17.48

470

Who's he hugging?

471



472

00:10:19.20,00:10:22.83

473

Oh, my God. That's Pete.[br]Why is Bill hugging Pete?

474



475

00:10:23.08,00:10:24.67

476

This guy invented Moss 865.

477



478

00:10:24.92,00:10:27.31

479

Every office in the world[br]uses that program.

480



481

00:10:27.56,00:10:29.60

482

-We use it![br]-There you go!

483



484

00:10:30.72,00:10:33.36

485

Monica's gonna go out[br]with a millionaire.

486



487

00:10:33.88,00:10:35.87

488

I'm not gonna go out with him.

489



490

00:10:36.08,00:10:39.71

491

I can't believe this is a real[br]$20,000 check. This is so exciting.

492



493

00:10:40.36,00:10:42.16

494

Or incredibly offensive.

495



496

00:10:42.40,00:10:43.72

497

Yeah, sure. That too.

498



499

00:10:56.20,00:10:57.63

500

What?

501



502

00:10:59.20,00:11:01.84

503

All we're saying is,[br]don't rush into anything.

504



505

00:11:02.08,00:11:05.99

506

Come on, think about it.[br]You're 1 8. She's 44.

507



508

00:11:06.40,00:11:09.52

509

When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

510



511

00:11:11.52,00:11:13.11

512

You don't think I know that?

513



514

00:11:16.32,00:11:17.91

515

The point is. . .

516



517

00:11:18.68,00:11:21.56

518

. . .there's a lot of women[br]you haven't had sex with yet.

519



520

00:11:21.80,00:11:24.63

521

He's right. He's right.[br]This is your time.

522



523

00:11:24.88,00:11:28.71

524

You're young. You're weird.[br]Chicks dig that.

525



526

00:11:29.00,00:11:33.04

527

Isn't sex better when it's with[br]one person that you really care about?

528



529

00:11:33.56,00:11:35.52

530

Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

531



532

00:11:36.56,00:11:39.92

533

No, the man's right.[br]That's what I had with Rachel.

534



535

00:11:40.12,00:11:41.39

536

Not anymore?

537



538

00:11:41.68,00:11:45.51

539

No. I slept with someone else.

540



541

00:11:45.72,00:11:48.71

542

So wait. So how did that[br]make things better?

543



544

00:11:50.28,00:11:51.68

545

It didn't.

546



547

00:11:53.32,00:11:56.52

548

What you used to have with Rachel[br]is what I got with Alice.

549



550

00:11:56.76,00:11:58.24

551

Now, what is that like?

552



553

00:11:58.48,00:11:59.75

554

It's so cool, man.

555



556

00:12:00.00,00:12:04.20

557

It's because being with her is so[br]much better than not being with her.

558



559

00:12:05.80,00:12:08.71

560

-Why can't I find that?[br]-I had it and I blew it.

561



562

00:12:08.92,00:12:10.24

563

Well, I want it!

564



565

00:12:10.44,00:12:11.35

566

You can have it.

567



568

00:12:11.56,00:12:14.03

569

Maybe there's something wrong with me.

570



571

00:12:14.36,00:12:17.95

572

No, it's out there, man.[br]I've seen it! I got it!

573



574

00:12:18.96,00:12:21.47

575

-Then, you hold on to it![br]-All right, man!

576



577

00:12:21.72,00:12:24.28

578

All right! Congratulations,[br]you lucky bastard!

579



580

00:12:24.92,00:12:26.51

581

You're Frank's best man?

582



583

00:12:29.00,00:12:31.43

584

I couldn't help it.[br]Their love is so pure.

585



586

00:12:32.60,00:12:34.51

587

What about you, huh?

588



589

00:12:35.12,00:12:36.39

590

I'm the ring bearer.

591



592

00:12:54.88,00:12:58.71

593

I'm so glad you could come.[br]I've got a real home-ec emergency.

594



595

00:12:58.92,00:13:01.51

596

Oh, my God. Who died on this?

597



598

00:13:02.12,00:13:03.84

599

It's a real "mustard-tastrophe. "

600



601

00:13:05.32,00:13:06.12

602

Can you help?

603



604

00:13:06.52,00:13:10.35

605

Absolutely. First, we'll start[br]with a little club soda and salt.

606



607

00:13:10.60,00:13:13.56

608

-Then if that doesn't work--[br]-Forget it. It's ruined.

609



610

00:13:13.80,00:13:17.31

611

Never say that. If you can't[br]get it out, cut around the stain. . .

612



613

00:13:17.56,00:13:20.84

614

. . .add a little lace,[br]you make a stylish throw.

615



616

00:13:21.72,00:13:25.03

617

Or instead, maybe you could just[br]not marry my brother, Frank?

618



619

00:13:29.72,00:13:32.68

620

Can we make it smaller?[br]Make it fit on the head of a pin?

621



622

00:13:32.88,00:13:35.71

623

I love when we make things[br]fit on the head of a pin.

624



625

00:13:37.80,00:13:39.52

626

You have Monica Geller here.

627



628

00:13:39.76,00:13:41.75

629

Absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

630



631

00:13:45.32,00:13:46.83

632

What the hell is this?

633



634

00:13:47.20,00:13:49.87

635

Hang on for a sec.[br]I'll talk to you in the morning?

636



637

00:13:50.08,00:13:50.88

638

You got it.

639



640

00:13:52.16,00:13:53.31

641

I'm sorry. What?

642



643

00:13:53.56,00:13:54.99

644

What's this supposed to mean?

645



646

00:13:55.20,00:13:58.27

647

Well, you know,[br]I never know how much to tip.

648



649

00:14:00.00,00:14:03.15

650

You double the tax.[br]Not double the tax of Romania.

651



652

00:14:05.32,00:14:08.95

653

Are you buying me? ls this how[br]you get girls to go out with you?

654



655

00:14:09.20,00:14:11.35

656

I'm still here.

657



658

00:14:14.36,00:14:17.32

659

You're taking this wrong.[br]If I didn't leave you that tip. . .

660



661

00:14:17.52,00:14:20.64

662

. . .you wouldn't have come,[br]we wouldn't have this argument. . .

663



664

00:14:20.88,00:14:23.31

665

. . .and there wouldn't be[br]this heat between us.

666



667

00:14:24.32,00:14:28.55

668

You gotta admit that our relationship[br]is hitting a new level now.

669



670

00:14:28.80,00:14:31.15

671

You were the chef[br]and I was the customer.

672



673

00:14:31.40,00:14:33.39

674

But now we're this couple that fights.

675



676

00:14:36.00,00:14:37.32

677

You're a loon.

678



679

00:14:38.20,00:14:41.95

680

Look, forget the check, okay?[br]I like you.

681



682

00:14:42.20,00:14:44.11

683

I think you're great.

684



685

00:14:44.96,00:14:46.36

686

Come on, what do you say?

687



688

00:14:48.92,00:14:50.15

689

I don't know.

690



691

00:14:50.40,00:14:51.59

692

Why not?

693



694

00:14:52.60,00:14:54.87

695

I don't wanna encourage[br]this behavior.

696



697

00:14:56.08,00:14:59.79

698

One meal.[br]That's all I'm asking for. Please?

699



700

00:15:00.36,00:15:01.71

701

We go out, we eat.

702



703

00:15:01.96,00:15:05.43

704

If you don't have a good time,[br]I'll give you 1 0 grand, we're even.

705



706

00:15:17.92,00:15:20.75

707

Wait, no. Just put the mail down.[br]It's me.

708



709

00:15:22.08,00:15:25.15

710

Sorry. Why were you[br]just all in the dark?

711



712

00:15:25.40,00:15:30.19

713

Your laundry smelled so good[br]that I thought I'd curl up in it.

714



715

00:15:30.56,00:15:32.39

716

-Is that all right?[br]-Yeah, sure.

717



718

00:15:32.64,00:15:33.96

719

So how was your day?

720



721

00:15:34.20,00:15:37.91

722

It's just probably the worst one[br]since I've been alive.

723



724

00:15:40.92,00:15:42.51

725

What happened?

726



727

00:15:43.20,00:15:46.56

728

Alice. . . .[br]She called it off.

729



730

00:15:50.52,00:15:52.95

731

Did she say why?

732



733

00:15:53.60,00:15:55.51

734

No. Just that I was too young.

735



736

00:15:55.76,00:15:58.32

737

I don't see how I could[br]suddenly be too young. . .

738



739

00:15:58.52,00:16:01.96

740

. . .because I'm older than I was[br]when we first got together.

741



742

00:16:05.92,00:16:10.55

743

I don't know. But you know what?[br]Maybe it's just all for the best.

744



745

00:16:10.80,00:16:14.19

746

Well, yeah, if the best is[br]like unbelievable pain.

747



748

00:16:14.72,00:16:16.39

749

Oh, sweetie.

750



751

00:16:17.00,00:16:19.72

752

You know, I was just finally happy.

753



754

00:16:20.08,00:16:22.51

755

For the first time in my life. . .

756



757

00:16:23.08,00:16:24.99

758

. . .after my dad left me. . .

759



760

00:16:25.20,00:16:30.11

761

. . .and then getting arrested[br]for stealing those birds. . .

762



763

00:16:30.48,00:16:33.92

764

. . .and then the whole[br]punctured-lung thing.

765



766

00:16:35.20,00:16:38.51

767

It's still really hard to take[br]deep breaths in cold weather. . .

768



769

00:16:38.72,00:16:42.51

770

. . .but with Alice,[br]all that stuff kind of went away.

771



772

00:16:43.72,00:16:47.95

773

And now it's gone,[br]and I don't know why.

774



775

00:16:49.96,00:16:53.32

776

Well, I can tell you why.[br]It's because of me.

777



778

00:16:54.52,00:16:57.88

779

But you know what? I only did it[br]because I love you, okay?

780



781

00:17:00.04,00:17:00.84

782

What?

783



784

00:17:01.04,00:17:03.76

785

I kind of had a little chat[br]with Alice. . .

786



787

00:17:04.00,00:17:07.67

788

. . .and I sort of made her see[br]why you two shouldn't be together.

789



790

00:17:07.88,00:17:10.95

791

And you'll see it too, one day.[br]You really, really will.

792



793

00:17:11.20,00:17:13.59

794

Wait a minute.[br]This is because of you?

795



796

00:17:15.36,00:17:17.92

797

My mother didn't want us[br]to be together. . .

798



799

00:17:18.12,00:17:20.92

800

. . .but the worst thing she did[br]was tie me to the porch.

801



802

00:17:23.24,00:17:26.68

803

I came to you because[br]I thought you'd understand.

804



805

00:17:31.56,00:17:33.52

806

I would storm out of here. . .

807



808

00:17:33.72,00:17:37.03

809

. . .if I had some money[br]or a place to go.

810



811

00:17:43.24,00:17:45.23

812

Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!

813



814

00:17:45.48,00:17:46.96

815

Oh, my God!

816



817

00:17:52.12,00:17:54.47

818

I'm just gonna have dinner with him.

819



820

00:17:54.68,00:17:59.12

821

Okay, just because he buys you dinner[br]does not mean you owe him anything.

822



823

00:18:00.88,00:18:01.71

824

I know.

825



826

00:18:02.96,00:18:05.00

827

Okay, then get the lobster.

828



829

00:18:13.56,00:18:16.03

830

How much cash you got[br]in your pocket now?

831



832

00:18:18.60,00:18:21.72

833

And that's why I'm not[br]inviting you in for a drink.

834



835

00:18:22.36,00:18:24.48

836

Why not? Hey, come in for drink.

837



838

00:18:25.96,00:18:28.31

839

-Where do you wanna go?[br]-You like pizza?

840



841

00:18:28.56,00:18:31.39

842

-That sounds great.[br]-I know a great little place.

843



844

00:18:37.36,00:18:39.24

845

You're not paying for the pizza.

846



847

00:18:39.44,00:18:42.51

848

Come on, it's only fair.[br]You paid for the flight.

849



850

00:18:43.48,00:18:44.51

851

Is that enough lira?

853

00:18:45.20,00:18:46.92

854

I'd throw another 1 000 on that.

855



856

00:18:47.52,00:18:49.87

857

-How much is that?[br]-That's about 60 cents.

858



859

00:19:00.92,00:19:02.75

860

Every night!

861



862

00:19:04.60,00:19:06.72

863

You don 't need to smoke.

864



865

00:19:06.96,00:19:09.43

866

Cigarettes don 't control you.

867



868

00:19:09.68,00:19:12.96

869

You are a strong, confident woman...

870



871

00:19:13.44,00:19:15.75

872

... who does not need to smoke.

873



874

00:19:16.12,00:19:19.08

875

A strong, confident woman...

876



877

00:19:19.36,00:19:21.92

878

... who does not need to smoke.

879



880

00:19:33.60,00:19:37.23

881

Look, I know that you think I did[br]this totally evil thing.

882



883

00:19:37.48,00:19:38.91

884

But I so didn't.

885



886

00:19:39.92,00:19:42.96

887

Someone's here who can explain this[br]better than I can.

888



889

00:19:54.32,00:19:56.04

890

Hi, Mrs. Knight.

891



892

00:19:58.40,00:20:00.36

893

Phoebe's right, Frank.

894



895

00:20:01.08,00:20:04.75

896

It's hard to hear, but it would've[br]been wrong to go through with it.

897



898

00:20:04.96,00:20:06.52

899

I was being selfish.

900



901

00:20:06.76,00:20:10.35

902

Even though we want[br]the same things right now. . .

903



904

00:20:10.60,00:20:13.35

905

. . .in the future, we may not.

906



907

00:20:14.44,00:20:16.83

908

-Is that what it is?[br]-Yes, but not just that.

909



910

00:20:17.08,00:20:18.31

911

Not just that.

912



913

00:20:21.84,00:20:26.75

914

Even though we love each other[br]as much as we do. . .

915



916

00:20:27.60,00:20:29.00

917

. . .nonetheless. . . .

918



919

00:20:31.32,00:20:32.72

920

Nonetheless.

921



922

00:20:37.92,00:20:40.11

923

You're too young. . .

924



925

00:20:40.56,00:20:43.76

926

. . .to really know what you want.

927



928

00:20:44.00,00:20:45.88

929

That's right, exactly.

930



931

00:20:48.12,00:20:50.08

932

That's a goodbye kiss.[br]That's good.

933



934

00:20:52.36,00:20:53.71

935

Bye-bye.

936



937

00:20:54.76,00:20:58.91

938

The important thing is,[br]is that you see what I'm saying.

939



940

00:20:59.56,00:21:01.71

941

This is clearly wrong.

942



943

00:21:03.20,00:21:05.55

944

I've decided I'm gonna[br]let this happen.

945



946

00:21:06.92,00:21:08.72

947

Can I just get my purse?

948



949

00:21:09.36,00:21:11.19

950

Okay, all right, good.

951



952

00:21:15.80,00:21:18.03

953

Cigarettes don 't control you.

954



955

00:21:18.28,00:21:21.16

956

You are a strong, confident woman...

957



958

00:21:21.40,00:21:24.20

959

... who does not need to smoke.

960



961

00:21:26.08,00:21:29.12

962

Joey's your best friend.

963



964

00:21:29.48,00:21:33.55

965

You wanna make him[br]a cheese sandwich every day.

966



967

00:21:35.92,00:21:40.83

968

And you also wanna buy him[br]hundreds of dollars worth ofpants.

969
