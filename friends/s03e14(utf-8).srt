16

00:00:11.19,00:00:14.81

17

'Cause every time I see your face

18



19

00:00:15.39,00:00:18.82

20

I can 't help but fall from grace

21



22

00:00:19.07,00:00:20.50

23

This girl's good.

24



25

00:00:20.71,00:00:24.33

26

Yeah, a song with rhyming words![br]I never thought of that before.

27



28

00:00:26.71,00:00:27.54

29

I like her.

30



31

00:00:27.75,00:00:31.82

32

Why? Because she can both sing[br]and play guitar at the same time?

33



34

00:00:32.83,00:00:35.46

35

That's all I'm looking for[br]from these people.

36



37

00:00:36.31,00:00:38.14

38

Look at you, all jealous.

39



40

00:00:38.39,00:00:41.46

41

Come on, Pheebs. You two have[br]completely different styles.

42



43

00:00:41.71,00:00:44.22

44

She's more. . . .[br]You know?

45



46

00:00:45.83,00:00:47.30

47

And you're more. . . .

48



49

00:00:48.67,00:00:52.10

50

Say you'll stay beside me

51



52

00:00:57.35,00:00:59.94

53

See? Everybody else is[br]happy she's done.

54



55

00:01:02.47,00:01:04.26

56

Okay, my next song's called:

57



58

00:01:04.51,00:01:07.42

59

"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?[br]I Loved When We Were. . .

60



61

00:01:07.67,00:01:10.82

62

. . .Singing Partners and I Shouldn't[br]Have Left You That Way. "

63



64

00:01:13.71,00:01:16.58

65

One of those "Iook for[br]the hidden meaning" songs.

66



67

00:01:18.27,00:01:20.30

68

The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner

73

00:02:05.67,00:02:07.02

74

Hey, Phoebe.

75



76

00:02:07.47,00:02:08.26

77

Hey, Leslie.

78



79

00:02:08.71,00:02:10.10

80

How'd you know I'd be here?

81



82

00:02:10.35,00:02:13.06

83

I saw vlad at the place[br]where they sell the big fish.

84



85

00:02:13.27,00:02:14.94

86

He said you played here a lot, so. . . .

87



88

00:02:15.27,00:02:16.74

89

I have to go to the bathroom.

90



91

00:02:16.99,00:02:18.86

92

If "big-fish place"[br]comes up again. . .

93



94

00:02:19.11,00:02:23.02

95

. . .I'd like to know if that's several[br]big fish or just one big fish.

96



97

00:02:24.23,00:02:26.06

98

So Phoebe says you write jingles.

99



100

00:02:26.31,00:02:28.98

101

Actually, I said she abandoned me[br]to write jingles.

102



103

00:02:31.03,00:02:32.54

104

Anything we might've heard of?

105



106

00:02:34.79,00:02:36.82

107

Home is never far away

108



109

00:02:37.03,00:02:41.02

110

Home is Homestar Stew.

111



112

00:02:42.27,00:02:45.06

113

But I don't do that anymore.[br]I got kind of sick of it.

114



115

00:02:45.31,00:02:49.62

116

And then I couldn't come up with[br]anything good, so they fired me.

117



118

00:02:49.87,00:02:50.85

119

Bummer.

120



121

00:02:52.51,00:02:54.86

122

Well, you know, I was just. . . .

123



124

00:02:55.11,00:02:58.34

125

I was just thinking[br]and just hoping that. . .

126



127

00:02:59.27,00:03:01.50

128

. . .maybe you'd want[br]to get back together?

129



130

00:03:02.19,00:03:03.46

131

No, but, thanks.

132



133

00:03:03.67,00:03:05.94

134

Come on, Phoebe.[br]Would you just think about it?

135



136

00:03:08.63,00:03:10.02

137

No, but, thanks.

138



139

00:03:15.79,00:03:17.22

140

See you, Pheebs.

141



142

00:03:21.23,00:03:22.42

143

That was kind of brutal.

144



145

00:03:23.03,00:03:25.22

146

Let this be a lesson to all of you.

147



148

00:03:25.47,00:03:28.66

149

Once you betray me,[br]I become like the lce Woman.

150



151

00:03:28.91,00:03:33.62

152

I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.

153



154

00:03:33.83,00:03:37.14

155

You know, nothing can[br]penetrate this icy exterior.

156



157

00:03:37.35,00:03:38.62

158

Can I have a tissue?

159



160

00:03:45.31,00:03:46.82

161

Is someone in there?

162



163

00:03:48.43,00:03:50.06

164

I'm playing a daredevil game. . .

165



166

00:03:50.31,00:03:53.58

167

. . .called "Wait Until the Last Moment[br]Before I Burst and Die. "

168



169

00:03:54.11,00:03:55.46

170

Jeez, man! Did you fall--?

171



172

00:03:55.71,00:03:56.62

173

Hi!

174



175

00:03:57.71,00:04:00.54

176

So did you?[br]Did you fall high?

177



178

00:04:01.59,00:04:03.62

179

Someone was in the ladies' room.[br]I couldn't wait.

180



181

00:04:03.87,00:04:05.90

182

I left the lid up for you, though.

183



184

00:04:08.11,00:04:10.06

185

You know what, Gunther?[br]Go ahead.

186



187

00:04:10.31,00:04:12.22

188

I'm talking to. . . .

189



190

00:04:14.03,00:04:15.82

191

This is where you say your name.

192



193

00:04:16.07,00:04:16.86

194

Ginger.

195



196

00:04:17.07,00:04:19.37

197

Ginger.[br]I'm talking to Ginger, so. . .

198



199

00:04:22.83,00:04:24.82

200

Don't you have to use the bathroom?

201



202

00:04:26.51,00:04:28.78

203

No, I just--[br]I'd rather talk to you.

204



205

00:04:29.83,00:04:30.66

206

Yes, I do.

207



208

00:04:31.91,00:04:33.98

209

Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

210



211

00:04:34.79,00:04:36.62

212

There's someone in here.

213



214

00:04:38.23,00:04:40.18

215

-Where's Chandler?[br]-He can't make it.

216



217

00:04:40.39,00:04:42.95

218

He said he had to go back[br]to his job and--

219



220

00:04:45.71,00:04:46.62

221

Joey?

222



223

00:04:48.67,00:04:49.81

224

Joey Tribbiani?

225



226

00:04:55.67,00:04:57.42

227

I can see you, okay?

228



229

00:04:57.63,00:04:59.62

230

You're hiding behind the coats.

231



232

00:05:10.39,00:05:11.42

233

Close one.

234



235

00:05:17.03,00:05:17.82

236

Hi.

237



238

00:05:18.63,00:05:19.42

239

Hi, sweetie.

240



241

00:05:19.63,00:05:20.42

242

Hello.

243



244

00:05:21.31,00:05:22.22

245

Hey, Ross.

246



247

00:05:25.43,00:05:27.38

248

-I've got some bad news.[br]-What?

249



250

00:05:27.67,00:05:29.82

251

I can eat,[br]but I have to come back here.

252



253

00:05:30.07,00:05:33.02

254

Come on. You've worked late[br]every night for two weeks.

255



256

00:05:33.23,00:05:35.86

257

-What is it now?[br]-It's my fault. I quit today.

258



259

00:05:36.11,00:05:37.94

260

But work comes first!

261



262

00:05:38.39,00:05:41.34

263

But that's sad about you, though.[br]What happened?

264



265

00:05:41.59,00:05:44.94

266

What happened? Burn out?[br]Burn all out, did you?

267



268

00:05:46.83,00:05:48.86

269

He's leaving for a better job.

270



271

00:05:49.11,00:05:52.02

272

That's great.[br]So I guess this is goodbye then.

273



274

00:05:52.27,00:05:53.25

275

Goodbye.

276



277

00:05:55.67,00:05:56.65

278

Okay, then.

279



280

00:05:57.47,00:05:59.62

281

Well, we're gonna[br]miss you around here.

282



283

00:06:00.11,00:06:01.02

284

Yeah, me too.

285



286

00:06:03.99,00:06:06.62

287

-So see you on Saturday.[br]-Yeah, you bet!

288



289

00:06:25.31,00:06:27.74

290

Now, you know those[br]are a delicacy in lndia.

291



292

00:06:29.31,00:06:32.62

293

That was Leslie calling[br]to see if we can get back together.

294



295

00:06:32.87,00:06:36.82

296

It's like the 20th time today.[br]Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

297



298

00:06:38.11,00:06:39.54

299

She must've hurt you bad.

300



301

00:06:39.75,00:06:42.46

302

Well, yeah.[br]You know, we were best friends. . .

303



304

00:06:42.71,00:06:46.22

305

. . .ever since we were little.[br]Our moms worked on the barge together.

306



307

00:06:47.31,00:06:49.98

308

You two must've been so cute,[br]running around on a barge.

309



310

00:06:50.19,00:06:52.22

311

You never run on a barge!

312



313

00:06:56.51,00:06:58.06

314

Is Chandler around?

315



316

00:06:58.31,00:07:00.54

317

He met some girl at the coffeehouse.

318



319

00:07:01.27,00:07:02.25

320

Ginger something.

321



322

00:07:05.91,00:07:10.26

323

Sure it wasn't something that sounded[br]liked Ginger? Like "Gingeer"?

324



325

00:07:11.79,00:07:13.01

326

No, it was Ginger.

327



328

00:07:13.27,00:07:15.26

329

I remember because[br]when he told me, I said:

330



331

00:07:15.51,00:07:17.62

332

The movie star

333



334

00:07:18.71,00:07:19.50

335

Oh, man!

336



337

00:07:19.83,00:07:21.74

338

That's the girl I was hiding from.

339



340

00:07:21.99,00:07:24.50

341

When she sees he's my roommate,[br]she'll tell him what I did.

342



343

00:07:24.71,00:07:25.62

344

What did you do?

345



346

00:07:26.31,00:07:27.94

347

Oh, no! I can't. . . .

348



349

00:07:29.23,00:07:33.22

350

I can't tell you. It's the[br]most awful thing I've ever done.

351



352

00:07:33.43,00:07:34.54

353

Don't tell us.

354



355

00:07:34.75,00:07:38.22

356

We'll wait till Chandler gets home.[br]It'll be more fun that way.

357



358

00:07:40.11,00:07:42.67

359

It was, like, four years ago.

360



361

00:07:42.91,00:07:45.78

362

Ginger and I had gone out a few times.[br]Then one weekend. . .

363



364

00:07:45.99,00:07:47.42

365

. . .we went to her Dad's cabin. . .

366



367

00:07:47.67,00:07:51.42

368

. . .just me, her and her[br]annoying little dog, Pepper.

369



370

00:07:51.67,00:07:54.54

371

That night I cooked[br]this really romantic dinner--

372



373

00:07:54.75,00:07:56.62

374

You gave her food poisoning!

375



376

00:07:57.07,00:07:58.02

377

I wish.

378



379

00:07:59.31,00:08:02.93

380

After dinner, me, her and Pepper[br]fell asleep in front of the fire.

381



382

00:08:03.31,00:08:07.46

383

I woke up in the middle of the night[br]and saw the fire was dying out. . .

384



385

00:08:07.71,00:08:10.14

386

. . .so I picked up a log[br]and threw it on.

387



388

00:08:12.11,00:08:13.82

389

Or what I thought was a log.

390



391

00:08:14.07,00:08:16.50

392

Oh, my God![br]You threw Pepper on the fire!

393



394

00:08:17.43,00:08:18.41

395

I wish.

396



397

00:08:20.71,00:08:24.18

398

Another thing I probably[br]should've told you about Ginger. . .

399



400

00:08:24.39,00:08:26.58

401

. . .is that she kind of has a. . .

402



403

00:08:27.31,00:08:28.34

404

. . .artificial leg.

405



406

00:08:34.23,00:08:35.62

407

Oh, my God!

408



409

00:08:37.39,00:08:40.42

410

What did you do after[br]you threw her leg on the fire?

411



412

00:08:41.31,00:08:42.26

413

I ran!

414



415

00:08:51.23,00:08:53.22

416

That's the best kiss I've had. . .

417



418

00:08:53.43,00:08:55.81

419

. . .with anybody I met[br]in a men's room.

420



421

00:08:56.83,00:08:57.94

422

Actually, me too.

423



424

00:08:59.99,00:09:01.94

425

Foot all in the puddle!

426



427

00:09:02.19,00:09:03.94

428

Damn! I hate that!

429



430

00:09:04.15,00:09:07.06

431

-You'll have to get out of those shoes.[br]-Don't worry.

432



433

00:09:07.35,00:09:09.10

434

No, really.[br]You're gonna freeze.

435



436

00:09:09.31,00:09:10.58

437

No, I'm not.

438



439

00:09:12.91,00:09:15.62

440

You're not?[br]Have you got a bionic foot?

441



442

00:09:16.79,00:09:18.46

443

Someday. Maybe.

444



445

00:09:28.95,00:09:30.06

446

Funny book?

447



448

00:09:31.91,00:09:35.22

449

I'm just thinking about[br]something funny I heard today.

450



451

00:09:36.67,00:09:39.42

452

Mark saying,[br]"I'll see you Saturday. "

453



454

00:09:41.51,00:09:42.73

455

Yeah, at the lecture.

456



457

00:09:42.99,00:09:45.74

458

I told you last week.[br]You said you didn't mind.

459



460

00:09:45.99,00:09:48.70

461

It's not the lecture I mind.

462



463

00:09:49.67,00:09:52.82

464

Please tell me it's not because[br]I'm going with Mark.

465



466

00:09:53.51,00:09:55.22

467

-Well--[br]-Oh, my God!

468



469

00:09:56.15,00:09:59.34

470

I'm sorry, but if you're not[br]working with him anymore. . .

471



472

00:09:59.55,00:10:01.42

473

. . .why do you still hang out?

474



475

00:10:01.67,00:10:03.26

476

Because he's my friend.

477



478

00:10:03.87,00:10:06.86

479

But do you really need[br]another "friend"?

480



481

00:10:09.23,00:10:12.82

482

If I stop playing with Joey[br]and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

483



484

00:10:13.39,00:10:15.90

485

Is that funny?[br]Am I suppose to be laughing?

486



487

00:10:16.11,00:10:19.62

488

I don't know. You thought[br]"See you Saturday" was funny.

489



490

00:10:20.23,00:10:21.45

491

Mark is in fashion.

492



493

00:10:21.71,00:10:24.62

494

I like having a friend[br]I can share this stuff with.

495



496

00:10:24.83,00:10:27.82

497

You guys would never[br]go to a lecture with me.

498



499

00:10:30.11,00:10:31.54

500

I'd love to go with you.

501



502

00:10:31.75,00:10:32.54

503

Really?

504



505

00:10:33.03,00:10:34.62

506

I have clothes.

507



508

00:10:34.87,00:10:36.26

509

I even pick them out.

510



511

00:10:36.51,00:10:39.82

512

For all you know,[br]I could be a fashion. . .

513



514

00:10:40.59,00:10:41.54

515

: : :monger:

516



517

00:10:46.87,00:10:49.22

518

I would love for you to go with me.

519



520

00:10:49.79,00:10:50.66

521

What?

522



523

00:10:51.51,00:10:53.81

524

What should I wear?[br]Now I'm all nervous.

525



526

00:11:03.51,00:11:06.66

527

You know, they say[br]"A watched pot never beeps. "

528



529

00:11:09.63,00:11:11.42

530

It's been a couple hours. . .

531



532

00:11:12.23,00:11:13.82

533

. . .and she hasn't called.

534



535

00:11:14.67,00:11:16.62

536

Not that I even care. I don't.

537



538

00:11:17.43,00:11:19.26

539

Why don't you just call her?

540



541

00:11:19.51,00:11:21.42

542

You obviously want to.

543



544

00:11:21.67,00:11:23.62

545

You think you know me so well.

546



547

00:11:23.91,00:11:25.46

548

Well, don't you wanna?

549



550

00:11:27.83,00:11:29.34

551

So I do know you.

552



553

00:11:29.59,00:11:31.02

554

That's what I said.

555



556

00:11:33.23,00:11:34.02

557

Well, so?

558



559

00:11:34.51,00:11:35.62

560

I can't.

561



562

00:11:36.11,00:11:38.22

563

I can't. She dumped me.

564



565

00:11:38.47,00:11:40.82

566

I totally trusted her,[br]then one day it was like:

567



568

00:11:41.03,00:11:42.98

569

"Okay, bye, Pheebs. "[br]Gone!

570



571

00:11:44.59,00:11:46.66

572

You know what the saddest part is?

573



574

00:11:46.91,00:11:49.21

575

When we were playing together,[br]that was. . .

576



577

00:11:49.47,00:11:52.42

578

. . .the most fun I've ever had[br]in all my lives.

579



580

00:11:54.39,00:11:59.02

581

My favorite shoes, so good to me[br]I wear them every day

582



583

00:11:59.27,00:12:04.02

584

Down at the heel, holes in the toes[br]Don 't care what people say

585



586

00:12:04.27,00:12:06.94

587

My feet's best friend[br]Pals to the end

588



589

00:12:07.19,00:12:09.65

590

With them, I'm one hot chickie

591



592

00:12:09.91,00:12:13.18

593

Though late one night[br]Not much light

594



595

00:12:13.39,00:12:16.82

596

I stepped in something icky

597



598

00:12:19.51,00:12:22.14

599

Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

600



601

00:12:22.39,00:12:24.82

602

Always make me smile

603



604

00:12:25.03,00:12:29.86

605

Sticky shoes, sticky shoes[br]Next time I'll...

606



607

00:12:30.87,00:12:33.54

608

...avoid the...

609



610

00:12:33.79,00:12:35.42

611

...pile!

612



613

00:12:43.91,00:12:48.26

614

We're beginning to see a lot of[br]layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

615



616

00:12:48.51,00:12:51.62

617

For instance, a sheer navy blouse[br]over a pink. . . .

618



619

00:12:51.83,00:12:54.21

620

I'm really glad we came.

621



622

00:12:59.07,00:12:59.98

623

You're so pretty.

624



625

00:13:03.31,00:13:04.62

626

I love you.

627



628

00:13:08.15,00:13:10.86

629

Smelly cat, smelly cat

630



631

00:13:11.11,00:13:13.74

632

What are they feeding you?

633



634

00:13:13.99,00:13:17.10

635

Smelly cat, smelly cat

636



637

00:13:17.35,00:13:19.91

638

It's not your fault

639



640

00:13:22.47,00:13:23.26

641

That's great!

642



643

00:13:24.11,00:13:26.22

644

You know, you could totally sell this.

645



646

00:13:26.43,00:13:30.21

647

It'd be perfect for, like,[br]a kitty-litter campaign.

648



649

00:13:31.03,00:13:32.82

650

A jingle?

651



652

00:13:33.39,00:13:34.94

653

Why not?[br]You'd make a ton of money.

654



655

00:13:35.15,00:13:38.46

656

If I was in this for the money,[br]I'd be a millionaire by now.

657



658

00:13:40.15,00:13:42.42

659

You gotta get out of[br]that jingle-head.

660



661

00:13:43.91,00:13:46.06

662

You're right.[br]You're right. I'm sorry.

663



664

00:13:46.27,00:13:47.06

665

That's okay.

666



667

00:13:47.31,00:13:50.42

668

I'm gonna play a song now[br]that's really, really sad.

669



670

00:13:50.63,00:13:53.42

671

It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up. "

672



673

00:13:58.55,00:14:01.06

674

Oversized bracelets,[br]oversized earrings. . .

675



676

00:14:01.31,00:14:05.18

677

. . .oversizing of accessories,[br]in general, is very popular now.

678



679

00:14:17.23,00:14:19.42

680

Can I borrow this?[br]My milk's gone bad.

681



682

00:14:19.67,00:14:20.62

683

I hate that.

684



685

00:14:20.87,00:14:23.98

686

I once had a thing of half-and-half.[br]Stole my car.

687



688

00:14:26.27,00:14:28.70

689

So how was your date with Ginger?

690



691

00:14:30.03,00:14:30.82

692

Great.

693



694

00:14:31.47,00:14:32.94

695

It was great. She's. . . .

696



697

00:14:33.19,00:14:35.98

698

She's great. Great looks[br]and personality. Greatness.

699



700

00:14:38.07,00:14:40.02

701

Sounds like she's got the. . .

702



703

00:14:40.51,00:14:41.86

704

. . .whole package.

705



706

00:14:43.19,00:14:45.42

707

Joey told you about the leg, huh?

708



709

00:14:47.19,00:14:49.02

710

Oh, God![br]It freaked me out.

711



712

00:14:49.27,00:14:50.82

713

It shouldn't, but it did.

714



715

00:14:51.03,00:14:53.46

716

I wanna keep seeing her,[br]but it's like:

717



718

00:14:53.71,00:14:56.01

719

"Hey, you know what?[br]Where's your leg?"

720



721

00:15:00.47,00:15:04.01

722

I'm the smallest person in the world,[br]aren't l?

723



724

00:15:04.27,00:15:05.10

725

Morning.

726



727

00:15:05.67,00:15:08.42

728

Actually, he's the smallest person[br]in the world.

729



730

00:15:14.11,00:15:16.06

731

Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

732



733

00:15:18.59,00:15:19.73

734

It came up.

735



736

00:15:20.87,00:15:23.22

737

Listen, I know it's a long shot, but. . .

738



739

00:15:24.75,00:15:27.42

740

. . .by any chance,[br]did she find that funny?

741



742

00:15:31.87,00:15:33.46

743

So I nodded off a little!

744



745

00:15:33.71,00:15:36.54

746

"Nodded off"?[br]Ross, you were snoring!

747



748

00:15:36.79,00:15:40.82

749

My father's boat didn't make[br]that much noise when it hit rocks!

750



751

00:15:41.03,00:15:43.33

752

Come on! Forty-five minutes. . . .

753



754

00:15:43.59,00:15:47.54

755

Forty-five minutes, the man talked[br]about strappy-backed dresses.

756



757

00:15:48.71,00:15:53.06

758

Okay, how about four hours[br]in a freezing museum auditorium. . .

759



760

00:15:53.31,00:15:55.46

761

. . .Iistening to[br]Professor "Pitstains" say:

762



763

00:15:55.71,00:15:58.94

764

"Remember that thing that died[br]a gazillion years ago?

765



766

00:15:59.19,00:16:02.34

767

Well, here's a little bone[br]we didn't know it had! "

768



769

00:16:05.63,00:16:09.41

770

First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

771



772

00:16:09.99,00:16:12.42

773

And second of all,[br]that little bone proved that. . .

774



775

00:16:12.63,00:16:15.86

776

. . .that particular dinosaur had wings[br]but didn't fly.

777



778

00:16:16.07,00:16:18.10

779

Okay, you know what I just heard?

780



781

00:16:22.71,00:16:26.86

782

A hundred million people[br]went to see a movie about what I do.

783



784

00:16:27.11,00:16:31.46

785

I wonder how many people would go see[br]a movie called Jurassic Parka.

786



787

00:16:31.71,00:16:33.62

788

Oh, that is so--

789



790

00:16:33.83,00:16:38.22

791

A bunch of out-of-control jackets[br]take over an island!

792



793

00:16:44.27,00:16:46.34

794

If what I do is so lame. . .

795



796

00:16:46.55,00:16:50.02

797

. . .then why did you insist on coming[br]with me this morning?

798



799

00:16:50.27,00:16:53.02

800

Was it so I just wouldn't[br]go with Mark?

801



802

00:16:55.31,00:16:57.42

803

I wanted to be with you.

804



805

00:16:58.19,00:17:00.22

806

I don't know, I feel like lately. . .

807



808

00:17:00.47,00:17:02.34

809

. . .you're slipping away from me. . .

810



811

00:17:02.55,00:17:04.85

812

. . .with this new job[br]and all these new people.

813



814

00:17:05.11,00:17:07.70

815

And you've got this[br]whole other life going on.

816



817

00:17:07.91,00:17:09.82

818

I know it's dumb. . .

819



820

00:17:10.07,00:17:13.98

821

. . .but I just hate[br]that I'm not a part of it.

822



823

00:17:18.27,00:17:19.62

824

It's not dumb.

825



826

00:17:21.27,00:17:24.22

827

But maybe it's okay[br]that you're not a part of it.

828



829

00:17:24.47,00:17:25.61

830

You know what I mean?

831



832

00:17:27.11,00:17:28.17

833

I mean, it's like. . .

834



835

00:17:28.39,00:17:32.42

836

. . .I like that you're not[br]involved in that part of my life.

837



838

00:17:33.19,00:17:34.82

839

That's a little clearer.

840



841

00:17:36.07,00:17:38.66

842

See, it doesn't mean[br]I don't love you. . .

843



844

00:17:38.91,00:17:41.98

845

. . .because I do.[br]I love you so much.

846



847

00:17:42.19,00:17:44.46

848

But my work--[br]It's for me, you know?

849



850

00:17:44.71,00:17:47.06

851

I'm out there on my own,[br]and I'm doing it.

852



853

00:17:47.31,00:17:51.22

854

And it's scary,[br]but I love it because it's mine.

855



856

00:17:52.07,00:17:54.02

857

But I mean, is that okay?

858



859

00:17:54.43,00:17:55.22

860

Sure.

861



862

00:18:05.31,00:18:07.18

863

You're thinking about my leg.

864



865

00:18:09.27,00:18:11.98

866

Actually, I forgot.[br]What's the deal with that again?

867



868

00:18:12.19,00:18:14.86

869

Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

870



871

00:18:15.11,00:18:17.82

872

I only need to know[br]how much it bothers you. . .

873



874

00:18:18.07,00:18:20.22

875

. . .because I don't like[br]wasting my time.

876



877

00:18:21.07,00:18:22.38

878

Am I wasting my time?

879



880

00:18:24.03,00:18:25.62

881

No, I don't think so.

882



883

00:18:26.79,00:18:30.02

884

It's like anything else.[br]You just have to get used to it.

885



886

00:18:42.03,00:18:42.90

887

What's that?

888



889

00:18:44.31,00:18:46.02

890

That's my "nubbin. "

891



892

00:18:50.63,00:18:52.02

893

What's a nubbin?

894



895

00:18:53.23,00:18:57.01

896

It's kind of a third-nipple[br]kind of thing.

897



898

00:18:58.59,00:19:00.06

899

You have three nipples?

900



901

00:19:00.27,00:19:02.22

902

Well, you know, two regulars. . .

903



904

00:19:02.79,00:19:06.06

905

. . .and one that[br]barely qualifies as a--

906



907

00:19:08.79,00:19:09.58

908

What?

909



910

00:19:09.83,00:19:11.34

911

Nothing. You know, l. . . .

912



913

00:19:11.59,00:19:13.62

914

I just remembered.[br]I have to leave.

915



916

00:19:13.87,00:19:17.14

917

You have to leave? Now? How come?

918



919

00:19:17.35,00:19:19.06

920

Well, it's nubbin.[br]Nothing!

921



922

00:19:20.91,00:19:24.14

923

You know what?[br]I'll see you later.

924



925

00:19:32.31,00:19:33.66

926

I thought you weren't coming.

927



928

00:19:34.19,00:19:36.22

929

-Where were you?[br]-Come here, come here.

930



931

00:19:38.07,00:19:39.18

932

Don't get mad, okay?

933



934

00:19:39.39,00:19:42.02

935

Don't give me a reason to get mad,[br]okay?

936



937

00:19:42.67,00:19:46.45

938

I played Smelly Cat for[br]my old ad agency. They went nuts!

939



940

00:19:46.67,00:19:49.86

941

I told you I didn't want you[br]to try and sell it. . .

942



943

00:19:50.11,00:19:53.26

944

. . .and you just big, fat did it anyway!

945



946

00:19:54.87,00:19:58.57

947

I think, five years ago,[br]I probably would have done anything. . .

948



949

00:19:58.79,00:20:00.14

950

. . .to play with you.

951



952

00:20:00.39,00:20:03.62

953

But I can do it myself.[br]If I can't trust you, then forget it.

954



955

00:20:04.11,00:20:05.54

956

I don't wanna forget it.

957



958

00:20:05.75,00:20:07.42

959

You know what?[br]You have to choose.

960



961

00:20:07.63,00:20:10.62

962

If the most important thing[br]on the planet to you. . .

963



964

00:20:10.83,00:20:15.74

965

. . .is this cat-poopy thing,[br]then you can have Smelly Cat.

966



967

00:20:15.99,00:20:17.82

968

But we won't be partners.

969



970

00:20:18.47,00:20:19.86

971

So what's it gonna be?

972



973

00:20:20.07,00:20:23.22

974

-Smelly cat, smelly cat[br]-Problem odor in the litter box?

975



976

00:20:23.43,00:20:26.58

977

Don 't change your kitty,[br]change your kitty litter.

978



979

00:20:27.03,00:20:29.26

980

It's not your fault

981



982

00:20:31.63,00:20:32.58

983

Sorry, Pheebs.

984



985

00:20:34.43,00:20:35.62

986

You okay?

987



988

00:20:37.19,00:20:38.46

989

I actually am.

990



991

00:20:38.67,00:20:42.21

992

Because, you know, life's gonna[br]hand you all kinds of stuff.

993



994

00:20:42.47,00:20:45.34

995

You learn your little lessons[br]and hopefully you grow.

996



997

00:20:46.47,00:20:49.03

998

-You wanna hear a new song?[br]-We'd love to.

999



1000

00:20:51.71,00:20:53.38

1001

Jingle bitch screwed me over

1002



1003

00:20:55.47,00:20:57.02

1004

Go to hell, jingle whore

1005



1006

00:20:57.27,00:21:01.10

1007

Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

1008



1009

00:21:01.71,00:21:03.66

1010

That's all I have so far.

1011



1012

00:21:08.63,00:21:10.02

1013

Well, hello!

1014



1015

00:21:11.11,00:21:12.82

1016

-Where you been?[br]-The doctor.

1017



1018

00:21:13.03,00:21:14.38

1019

Is everything okay?

1020



1021

00:21:14.59,00:21:17.02

1022

Just had me[br]a little nubbin-ectomy.

1023



1024

00:21:20.51,00:21:22.18

1025

Two nipples, no waiting.

1026



1027

00:21:22.39,00:21:25.62

1028

Well! Just like Rachel[br]in high school.

1029



1030

00:21:26.87,00:21:27.85

1031

What?

1032



1033

00:21:28.67,00:21:31.74

1034

Come on, I was kidding![br]It was such an obvious joke.

1035



1036

00:21:31.95,00:21:33.66

1037

That was an obvious joke.

1038



1039

00:21:33.91,00:21:35.82

1040

And I didn't think of it. Why?

1041



1042

00:21:37.07,00:21:39.02

1043

The source of all my powers.

1044



1045

00:21:40.67,00:21:43.02

1046

Oh, dear God, what have I done?

1047
