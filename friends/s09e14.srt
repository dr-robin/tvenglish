1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
- Morning, roomie.- Hey!

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
You rememberedto put clothes on this morning.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
Fifth day's a charm.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:15
It's so great to be back here. You'remaking it so easy on me and Emma.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
It's great having you back.Stay as long as you want.

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
And when does she stopcrying all night?

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
Hey! You're not naked.

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
Rach, when will we expectto see you tonight?

9
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Probably around 6. But she'sin the bedroom, all ready to go.

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
But she fell back to sleep, so...

11
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
She's probably exhausted from all thatadorable screaming she did last night.

12
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
- Bye.- Bye.

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
Hey, I hope Emma isn't making ittoo hard on you.

14
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
No, hey, it's been great.

15
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
I just want you to know thatwith Rachel staying here...

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
...all my feelings from beforeare totally over.

17
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
And even if they weren't...

18
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
...when you walk inon a woman using a breast pump...

19
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
- Yeah, that'll do it.- Wow!

20
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
So how are you?

21
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
- I'm okay.- Really?

22
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
Sure. I mean, do I wish me and Rachelliving together would have worked out?

23
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,but it's not like it's a divorce.

24
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
- Well, actually it...- It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!

25
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
Anyway, I think Rachel and Ineed to get on with our lives.

26
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
Maybe start seeing other people.

27
00:01:13 --> 00:01:14
Wow. Really?

28
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
Sure, why not? In fact, if you knowanyone that'd be good for me...?

29
00:01:17 --> 00:01:20
- Sure. I know lots of girls.- Any names come to mind?

30
00:01:21 --> 00:01:22
Names?

31
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28

34
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
- I was about to eat. Want something?- What you got?

35
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,strained carrots...

36
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
...strained plums.We haven't tried that yet!

37
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
Goody!

38
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
Thanks.

39
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
So how is it living with Rachel again?

40
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
I mean, apart from the great food?

41
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just...

42
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
It's just weird what's happeningwith her and Ross.

43
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Yesterday he asked me to fix him upwith somebody.

44
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
Rachel asked meif I knew anyone for her too.

45
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
- Why are they doing this?- I don't know.

46
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
They're so perfect for each other.It's crazy.

47
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
You know what's crazy? These jars.

48
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
What is there, like, two bites in here?

49
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
I just wish they'd realizethey should be together.

50
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
When they moved in together, Ifigured that's where things were headed.

51
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
They should be a family. They shouldmarry and have more children.

52
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
Yes. And they should nameone of their kids Joey.

53
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
I may not have kids. Someone'sgot to carry on the family name.

54
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
You know what? Maybe once theystart dating and see what's out there...

55
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
...they'll realize how goodthey are for each other.

56
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
Yeah, because it is slim pickings.

57
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
I had this date last night. Yuck!

58
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
But we should probably keep it down,she's still in the bedroom.

59
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
So, what are we gonna do? Are wejust gonna set them up with people?

60
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
I know, that just pushes themfurther and further apart.

61
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
I know what we can do. We could setRoss and Rachel up on horrible dates...

62
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
...so they'll realizehow good they are together.

63
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
- That's a great plan.- Yeah.

64
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
You know what the best part of it is?I get to do my plan laugh.

65
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
Okay, shh! Not so loud.We don't want to wake up...

66
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
Hi. You guys aren'tdoing anything tonight, are you?

67
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
See, now, why would you assume that?Just because we're married?

68
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
I mean, I will have you knowthat we are very hip, happening people.

69
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
Now if you'll excuse me, I have toget back to reading the obituaries.

70
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
I was just asking because I needsomeone to watch Emma tonight.

71
00:03:53 --> 00:03:54
Sure we'll do it.What are you up to?

72
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
- Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.- Oh, my God.

73
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
- Why? What's the big deal?- I figured because you and Ross are...

74
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
What? Slept together a yearand a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.

75
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
I think it's great you're going on a date.It sounds healthy.

76
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
I mean, you have needs.Embrace your womanhood.

77
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
You want a job? Turn off "Oprah"and send out a resume.

78
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
- I'll bring her by around 7, okay?- That's perfect.

79
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
You guys are gonna have so much fun.She's at such a cute age.

80
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
A couple things. Now that she eatssolid food, she poops around the clock.

81
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
And watch out for your hairbecause she likes to grab it.

82
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
She's also in this phase where if youleave the room, she screams, but...

83
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
Thanks, you guys. Have fun.

84
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
Suddenly I wish I was readingmy own name.

85
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
Joey, hey. I'm so excited.

86
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
- I set Rachel up with the worst guy.- All right. Who is he?

87
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
It's a guy I used to massage.By "massage"...

88
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
...I mean hold down so he wouldn'tturn over and flash me.

89
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
- Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.- Oh, yeah.

90
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
Okay. She's this really boring woman.She's a teacher.

91
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
- A teacher?- She's into history and foreign movies.

92
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
And she loves puzzles.

93
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
Come on, who loves puzzles?

94
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Well, Ross does.

95
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
You're ruining the plan!

96
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
Joey, you fixed him upwith his perfect woman.

97
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
- Oh, my God, you're right!- Yeah.

98
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
She even reads for pleasure!

99
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
- How do you know a woman like that?- I'm not allowed to know smart women?

100
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
- Joey?- We met at the library. I went in to pee.

101
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
- So now what do we do?- Well, okay.

102
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
I'll call her and tell her the date'scanceled and find him somebody else.

103
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
What if we don't find him somebodyelse? We'll just tell her the date's off...

104
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
...but we don't tell Ross. He'll goto the restaurant and get stood up.

105
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
I hear that's bad.

106
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
So this is great. Rachel'sgonna have a terrible date...

107
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
...Ross gets stood up, and then they'llrealize how good they have it together.

108
00:05:48 --> 00:05:49
Yes, the plan.

109
00:05:52 --> 00:05:53
It's not Santa's plan.

110
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
No, it's...

111
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
- Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.- No, I think we killed it.

112
00:06:07 --> 00:06:08
Emma? Emma, look at me!

113
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
Well, I think I'll go downstairsfor a while.

114
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay!I didn't go!

115
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
Don't cry, it's just a bit!

116
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
I'm your uncle Chandler.Funny is all I have!

117
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna beovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.

118
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
So don't touch yourselffor the next 48 hours.

119
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
I don't do that.

120
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
I'll try to stop.

121
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
- Did you say until the 6th?- Yeah.

122
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
Today is the 6th.

123
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
No, it's not.

124
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Yes, it's also 2003.

125
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?

126
00:06:47 --> 00:06:48
I may be done ovulating!

127
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
I may have also served some veryquestionable meat at the restaurant.

128
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
- Go take the test, see if we're okay.- Okay.

129
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
Tough crib.

130
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?There's only one here.

131
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
I might have checked to seeif I was ovulating a couple times.

132
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
I'm not working! There's not muchto do around here!

133
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
Excuse me.

134
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
Is there a woman waiting at the bar?

135
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
Someone average height, dark hair?Or perhaps doing a puzzle?

136
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
There's a drunk Chinese guy.

137
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
Well, if I'm still here in an hour,buy him a drink on me.

138
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
Can I get you another glass of wine?

139
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
I don't know if I should.I don't want to be drunk when I...

140
00:07:45 --> 00:07:46
...go home alone tonight.

141
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
- Got stood up, huh?- It's no big deal. It's just a blind date.

142
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
Are you worried your date came,saw you and left?

143
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
No!

144
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.

145
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Oh, good, because as of 4:00this afternoon, I am not.

146
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
So let's do this.

147
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
- I don't think I can.- Oh, come on.

148
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
I know you're not 18 anymore,but give it a minute.

149
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
- Because of Emma.- Oh, my God, Emma.

150
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.

151
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
You're right, we can't do this.We can't leave her alone.

152
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
Sorry.

153
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24
Unless...

154
00:08:25 --> 00:08:26
...maybe we do it here.

155
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
I mean, how much can she evenbe aware of at this age?

156
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
She's aware when we leave a room.She may notice if we start...

157
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
...canoodling in it.

158
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
- Canoodling?- Well, I can't say hump or screw...

159
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
...in front of the B-A-B-Y.

160
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
I don't know,I guess having sex in front of a baby...

161
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
...isn't so...- Horrifying? Scarring?

162
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Something people go to jail for?

163
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
- I guess you're right.- You guess?

164
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
At that bed-and-breakfast,we didn't have sex...

165
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
...because you thought a deerwas staring through the window.

166
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
Well, what kind of a sick bastardwants to do it in front of a deer?

167
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
Wow, everything looks so good.

168
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
I think I'm gonna have the chicken.

169
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
I just have to say this.

170
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
- You're really beautiful.- Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.

171
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
I'm kind of funny-looking.

172
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
- What?- Look, I mean, come on...

173
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
...you're way out of my league.Everybody in here knows it.

174
00:09:27 --> 00:09:28
I bet that guy over thereis probably saying:

175
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
"Why's she out with him?He must be rich."

176
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
Well, I'm not.

177
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
What do you think you want to order?I'm real excited about that chicken.

178
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
I'm not funny, either.

179
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
So if you were thinking,"Well, he's not that good-looking...

180
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
...but maybe we'll have some laughs,"that ain't gonna happen.

181
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
Well, come on, Steve,let's not rule out nervous laughter.

182
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
Hey, now, wait a minute,Phoebe told me...

183
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
...that you owned your own restaurant.That's impressive.

184
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
I lost it to drugs.

185
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
I silk-screen T-shirts now.

186
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
Really?What's that like?

187
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
It's really fulfilling doing somethingyou hate for no money.

188
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
That's right. I have no money,I'm not funny...

189
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
...I live in a studio apartmentwith two other guys.

190
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
And I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.

191
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
Now, come on. Come on, Steve.

192
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
There must be somethingthat you like about yourself.

193
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
I do like my hair.

194
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
Really?

195
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
- Hello?- Phoebe, it's me!

196
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
I'm going to hunt you downand kill you.

197
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
Hey, Rach!

198
00:10:57 --> 00:11:01
This is the worst date ever! How couldyou set me up with this creep?

199
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
You know, you are talking aboutone of my dear, dear friends.

200
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.

201
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
All right, so he gets a little crazywhen he's stoned.

202
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
- He's not stoned.- Did he go out for a cigarette?

203
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
- Yeah. Four times.- My dear, sweet Rach.

204
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
Well, our plan is working.Rachel's having a miserable time...

205
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
...and Ross is stood up somewhereat a restaurant all alone.

206
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
Pretty soon they'll be back together.

207
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
By the time anyone's figured out whatwe've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.

208
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
Oh, wait, that's the endof a different plan.

209
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
She's asleep. Chandler?

210
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
- What are you doing?- Emma was doing it.

211
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
She's asleep.

212
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
- She's asleep. That means we can...- Yes. But we have to be fast.

213
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
Oh, okay, I'll try.

214
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
- And you can't make any noise.- Okay, I'll try.

215
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
Hello?

216
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
Emma?

217
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
Hey! Hi!

218
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
How are you? How are you?

219
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
Where are your babysitters, huh?

220
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
Why is the bedroom door closed?

221
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
You can't have S-E-Xwhen you're taking care of a B-A-B-l-E.

222
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
I've got bad news.The Chinese guy left.

223
00:12:33 --> 00:12:35
If it was meant to be, it's meant to be.

224
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Look, you got stood up. Who cares?

225
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
We're gonna show you a good time.Sit and relax.

226
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
In fact, let me bring youa crab-cake appetizer on the house.

227
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
Wow, free crab cakes?Well, that's nice.

228
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
Although I was hopingto have sex tonight.

229
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Just the crab cakes.

230
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
What are you doing? Are you tryingto get him to stay? You can't do that.

231
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
- Just get out of here, okay?- I'm sorry, what's going on?

232
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
Okay, the waiters havea little pool going.

233
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
We have a bet on how long it'll takebefore you give up and go home.

234
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
What?!

235
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
You're making money off my misery?

236
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.

237
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
This is unbelievable. I have neverbeen so insulted in my life.

238
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
Now, if you'll wrap up my freecrab cakes, I'll be on my way.

239
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
Well, that was weird.You were loud and I was fast.

240
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
I think we may havereally done it this time.

241
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
I wish I didn't have to waitto take a pregnancy test.

242
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
You may want to getsome more of those too.

243
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
Where's Emma?

244
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
Oh, my God, where's Emma?Where's Emma?

245
00:13:42 --> 00:13:44
Don't ask me.I was in there canoodling you.

246
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Rachelcame home early and picked up Emma.

247
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
You go look across the hall,and I'll call her cell.

248
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
You better hope we're pregnant...

249
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
...because one way or another,we're giving a baby back to Rachel!

250
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
I can't believe I'm cryingin front of you.

251
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
You must think I'm so pathetic.

252
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
No, no, no, I admire a manwho can cry.

253
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
- Really?- Don't touch my coat.

254
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
Sorry, that's my phone.

255
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
- Hello?- Hey, Rach, how's it going?

256
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
Oh, my God,this is the worst date ever.

257
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
Oh, come on.

258
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but didyou really think that this was going well?

259
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
- What's up?- Hey, did you stop by here?

260
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
- No.- Oh, my God! Then...

261
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
Thank God! Emma, there you are!

262
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
What? What do you mean,"there you are"? Where was she?

263
00:14:35 --> 00:14:40
We were playing peekaboo.She loves it when I'm dramatic.

264
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
- Why the hell did you take her?- Because you two were having sex!

265
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
- No, we weren't.- Don't you lie to me.

266
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
I can tell by Chandler's hair. You areso lazy. Can't you get on top for once?

267
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
All right. All right, we were.

268
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
We're trying to make a baby.Monica's ovulating.

269
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
It's unacceptable that you'dhave sex with Emma in the next room.

270
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
- I'll have to tell Rachel about this.- Please don't. She will kill us.

271
00:15:07 --> 00:15:09
Hey, I gotta. Unless...

272
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
Unless what?

273
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
Unless you nameyour first-born child Joey.

274
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
- What? Why?- Hey, I may never have kids...

275
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
...and somebody's gottacarry on my family name.

276
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
Your family name is Tribbiani.

277
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
You almost had me.

278
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
Look...

279
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
...I think I know the answerto this question, but...

280
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
...would you like to make love to me?

281
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
Really, really not.

282
00:15:51 --> 00:15:52
It's just as well.

283
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
It doesn't work anyway.

284
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
All right, well, that's good to know.Good night, Steve.

285
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
- Hey, what's wrong?- I just had a rough night.

286
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
Crab cake?

287
00:16:18 --> 00:16:19
Well, what happened?

288
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
This is kind of weirdto talk to you about this, but...

289
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
Monica told me you had a blind date.

290
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
- Yeah.- I did too.

291
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
But is it technically a dateif the other person doesn't show up?

292
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
Oh, no. Do you think she walked in,saw you and left?

293
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
Why does everyone keep saying that?

294
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
If it makes you feel any better,I wish my date hadn't shown up.

295
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
- That bad?- Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...

296
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
...and he thought it would beappropriate to give me...

297
00:16:48 --> 00:16:49
...this.

298
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
"Female Body Inspector"?

299
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
What size is that?

300
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
Now wait a minute. So they're gonnaname their first child Joey?

301
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
How do I get them to namethe next one after me?

302
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
It's easy. You justwalk in on them having sex.

303
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
Oh, so they owe me,like, three Phoebes.

304
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
Oh, my God!Look, it's Ross and Rachel!

305
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
The plan is working!

306
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
Don't do the plan laugh.

307
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
The first dates we've had in months,and they were both such disasters.

308
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
You know, it is weird...

309
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
...that Phoebe would set me upon a date that was awful...

310
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
...on the same night Joey set you upon a date that didn't even show.

311
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
Wait a minute.

312
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
You don't think it was intentional?

313
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
I mean, that's just stupid.

314
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
We're geniuses.

315
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
- Look at them! They're really bonding.- They're falling in love all over again.

316
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
Oh, they see us. Oh, they look mad.

317
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
They figured it out.They're coming. Run!

318
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
- Where?- Mexico!

319
00:17:57 --> 00:17:59
Can you believe they're still not here?

320
00:17:59 --> 00:18:02
I know. A double blind dateand we both get stood up.

321
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
What are the chances?

322
00:18:05 --> 00:18:07
I know, I'm so bummed.

323
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
Could we haveour free crab cakes now?

324
00:18:10 --> 00:18:12
- What?- We've been stood up.

325
00:18:12 --> 00:18:15
And we want our free crab cakes.

326
00:18:15 --> 00:18:17
Guys, give it a rest.Nobody's betting on you tonight.

327
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
Although we do have a pool goingto see how long it takes that guy to cry.

328
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
I have such fat hands!

329
00:18:30 --> 00:18:31
