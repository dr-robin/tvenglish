I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:01 --> 00:00:04
- I'm sorry, Amber.

4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07

5
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
Sorry I'm late.What happened?

6
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
We wanna see the end.

7
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
I want you, Drake.

8
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
I know you do.

9
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
be together that way.

10
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
What?

11
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
There's something I never told you.

12
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
I'm actually your half-brother.

13
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
So what happens next?

14
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
I get the medical awardfor separating the Siamese twins.

15
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
Then Amber and I go to Venezuelato meet our other half-brother, Ramon...

16
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
...where I find the world'sbiggest emerald. It's really big.

17
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
But it's cursed.

18
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
So cool!

19
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
God, that is good TV!

22
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
Pheebs, play with me!

23
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
This game is grotesque!

24
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
Twenty armless guys joinedat the waist by a steel bar...

25
00:01:26 --> 00:01:29
...forced to play soccer forever?

26
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
Hello? Human rights violation!

27
00:01:31 --> 00:01:33
Don't feel so bad.After playing...

28
00:01:33 --> 00:01:38
...I break out the plastic womenand everybody has a good time.

29
00:01:38 --> 00:01:41
Why don't you play with your roommate?

30
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
He's not a big fan of foosball.

31
00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
Are we not getting alongwith the new boy?

32
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
No, he's all right. He spendsmost of his time in his room.

33
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
That's because you haven'tgotten to know him.

34
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
Let's remedy that, shall we?

35
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
- We don't need to.- It'll be fun!

36
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
What was that?

37
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
I thought it'd be fun if we hadbeers and got to know each other.

38
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
All right.

39
00:02:03 --> 00:02:04
Oh, good! Okay.

40
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
Oh, no! I have to go,because I'm late for...

41
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
...my "Green Eggs and Ham"discussion group.

42
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
Tonight, it's "Why he would noteat them on a train."

43
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
- Have fun! Bye!- That was so lame.

44
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
I know.

45
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
Okay, talk to him.

46
00:02:22 --> 00:02:27
So you think that "Speed Racer" guygets a lot of tickets or...?

47
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
That's good.So who broke up with who?

48
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
I broke up with her.

49
00:02:32 --> 00:02:36
She actually thought Sean Pennwas the capital of Cambodia.

50
00:02:36 --> 00:02:40
When everybody knows thatthe capital of Cambodia is...

51
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
It's not Sean Penn.

52
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
I got a funny one.

53
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
My last girlfriend, Tilly.We're eating breakfast, right?

54
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
I made these pancakes.Like, 50 pancakes.

55
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
All of a sudden,she turns to me and says, "Eddie...

56
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
...I don't wanna see you anymore."

57
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
It was literally like she hadreached into my chest...

58
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
...ripped out my heartand smeared it all over my life!

59
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
There was this incredible abyssand I'm falling.

60
00:03:01 --> 00:03:06
I keep falling andI don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

61
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
That wasn't such a funny story.

62
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
Said I'll do what I can

63
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
Played maracas

64
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

65
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
Phoebe's got another job, right?

66
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
Great set tonight, Pheebs.

67
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
I know.

68
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
We should get going.

69
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
We should too.I've got patients at 8 in the morning.

70
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
You know how we always stayat your apartment?

71
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
I thought tonightwe'd stay at my place.

72
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
I don't know.I don't have my jammies.

73
00:03:41 --> 00:03:42
You don't need them.

74
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

75
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
Shut up. I'm happy.

76
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
Oh, this is so nice!I have to make a speech.

77
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
Of all the guys that Monica hasbeen with, and that is a lot...

78
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
...I like you the best.

79
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
Thank you, Pheebs.That's very sweet.

80
00:04:01 --> 00:04:02
You hear that?

81
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
She likes me best. And apparently,there have been a lot.

82
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
Not a lot.

83
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.

84
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
Phoebe's dead.

85
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

86
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
He's not here right now.I'm Chandler.

87
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Can I take a message or...Or a fish tank?

88
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
Thanks.

89
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
Come on in.

90
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
I'm Tilly.

91
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
I gather by that "Oh",he told you about me.

92
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
Yeah, your name came up...

93
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
...in a conversation thatterrified me to my very soul.

94
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
He's kind of intense.

95
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
Yes! Hey, can I ask you,is Eddie a little...

96
00:04:46 --> 00:04:46
A little what?

97
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
...bit country?

98
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Come on in, you roomie!

99
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
Hello, Tilly.

100
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
Eddie, I just came byto drop off your tank.

101
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
That was very thoughtful of you.

102
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
It's very thoughtful.

103
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
Well, okay then.

104
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
I'm gonna go. Bye.

105
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
So we getting a fish?

106
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
You had sex with her.

107
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
Check it out, check it out!

108
00:05:16 --> 00:05:21
"Soap Opera Digest"!That's one of my favorite digests!

109
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
Page 42! Page 42!

110
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
"New Doc on the Block,'Days of our Lives' Joey Tribbiani."

111
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
Cool picture!

112
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Oh, I look good.

113
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
Is this true? That you writea lot of your own lines?

114
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
Well, kind of, yeah.

115
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Remember last weekwhen Alex was in the accident?

116
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
The line in the script was...

117
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
..."If we don't get this womanto a hospital, she's going to die."

118
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
But I made it, "If this womandoesn't get to a hospital...

119
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
...she's not gonna live."

120
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
Oh, okay.I see what you did there.

121
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
Aren't you afraid the writers will bekind of mad when they read this?

122
00:05:59 --> 00:06:04
I never thought about the writers.The scripts just come to my house.

123
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
But you know what?

124
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
This makes me look good,which makes the show look good...

125
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
...which makes the writers look good.So how could they be mad?

126
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
Makes up most of his lines.

127
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
Son of a...

128
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
Write this, jerk-weed.

129
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
I fall down an elevator shaft?

130
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
What does this mean?I fall down an elevator shaft?

131
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
I don't know.I just bring the scripts.

132
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
They can't kill me!I'm Francesca's long-lost son!

133
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Right.

134
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
Could you sign?

135
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

136
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
I don't think that will affectthe plot of the show.

137
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
How can they do this to me?

138
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
All right, I'm just gonna go.

139
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
Sorry.

140
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
Well, it wasn't that many guys.

141
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
If you consider how many guysthere actually are...

142
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
...it's a very small percentage.

143
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
It's not that big a deal.I was just curious.

144
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
- Good night.- Good night, Richard.

145
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
Good luck, Mon.

146
00:07:05 --> 00:07:10
Before I tell you, you tell mehow many women you've been with.

147
00:07:11 --> 00:07:11
Two.

148
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
Two? Two?

149
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
How is that possible? I mean...

150
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
...have you seen you?

151
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
I mean, what can I say?

152
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,my high-school sweetheart.

153
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
Now you. That's two.

154
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
Two it is.

155
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
Time for bed.I'm gonna brush my teeth.

156
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
No, wait a minute now!

157
00:07:33 --> 00:07:34
Come on, it's your turn.

158
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
Oh, come on!

159
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
You know, I don't need theactual number. Just a ballpark.

160
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
Okay, it is definitelyless than a ballpark.

161
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
I am so gladI'm not Monica right now.

162
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
Tell me about it.

163
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
So what's your magic number?

164
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
Come on, you know everyoneI've been with. All both of them.

165
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
Well, there's you.

166
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Better not be doing these in order.

167
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.

168
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
Barry.

169
00:08:09 --> 00:08:10
Paolo.

170
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

171
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

172
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
I'm so much happier with youthan I ever was with him.

173
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
- Really?- Oh, please!

174
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
That Paolo thing wasbarely a relationship.

175
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
All it really waswas just meaningless, animal sex.

176
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
Okay, you know, that soundedso much better in my head.

177
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
I didn't sleep withyour ex-girlfriend.

178
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
That's exactly what someonewho slept with her would say.

179
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
This is nuts! Crazy!She came over for two minutes...

180
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
...dropped off a fish tank and left!

181
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
Where's Buddy?

182
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
Buddy?

183
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
My fish, Buddy.

184
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
There was no fishwhen she dropped it off.

185
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
This is unbelievable!

186
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,insult my intelligence by lying...

187
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
...then you kill my fish?My Buddy?

188
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
I didn't kill your fish!

189
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
Look, Eddie...

190
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
Would you look at what I'm doing?

191
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
Now that can't be smart.

192
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
So we're just gonnatake this guy right off you...

193
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

194
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
Tangelo?

195
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
That's it? That's the giant numberyou were afraid to tell me?

196
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
Well, that's not bad at all.

197
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
You had me thinking it was,like, a fleet.

198
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
You're okay with it?

199
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
Oh, honey, I'm fine.

200
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
Okay, about that two.

201
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
What?

202
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
All right.

203
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
What about my two?

204
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
It just seems likea really small number.

205
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
Right.

206
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
Don't you have a lotof wild oats to sow?

207
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
Or is that what you're doing with me?Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

208
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
Honey, you are not an oat.

209
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
I don't know, I guessI'm just not an oat guy.

210
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
I've only slept with women I love.

211
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
You've only slept with two people.

212
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
Right.

213
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
You know I love you too, right?

214
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
Now I do.

215
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
Ross, please listen to me.

216
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
You are so much better for methan Paolo ever was.

217
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
You care about me, you're loving,you make me laugh.

218
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.

219
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
Invite Paolo to havea romp in the sack...

220
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
...and I'll stand in the cornerand tell knock-knock jokes!

221
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
What we have is special!All Paolo and I ever had was...

222
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
"Animal sex"?

223
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
So what are you saying?

224
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
There's nothing between us"animal" at all?

225
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
There's not even,like, a little animal?

226
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
Not even, like...

227
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
...chipmunk sex?

228
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
Try to hear me, okay?

229
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
I'm not gonna lie to you.

230
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
- It was good with Paolo.- Knock-knock.

231
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
But what you and I haveis so much better.

232
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
We have tenderness,we have intimacy, we connect.

233
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
You know? I swear.

234
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
This is the best...

235
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
...I have ever had.

236
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Until now.

237
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
Richard told me he loved me.

238
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
- Oh, my God!- I know!

239
00:11:34 --> 00:11:35
Honey, that's great!

240
00:11:35 --> 00:11:36
I know!

241
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
- I just can't find...- Top drawer.

242
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
- Hurry.- Why? You need one too?

243
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
Found them!

244
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
There's only one.

245
00:11:50 --> 00:11:55
We'll be right there.We're just trying to decide something.

246
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
- They're trying to decide something.- Good. Good, good.

247
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
So was your mustache...Did it used to be different?

248
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
How do you, you know,keep it so neat?

249
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
I have a comb.

250
00:12:33 --> 00:12:35
- What is that?- A mustache comb.

251
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Thank you.

252
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
Okay, I will do your laundryfor one month.

253
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
I will, I will, I will...

254
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
I will clean the apartmentfor two months.

255
00:12:46 --> 00:12:51
I'll give this to you now, if youtell me where we keep the dustpan.

256
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
So were you in Nam?

257
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
- Rock, paper, scissors?- Gotcha.

258
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
One, two, three.

259
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
Yes!

260
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
Fine. Go have sex.

261
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
No! You have got it completely wrong!

262
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
John Savage was "Deer Hunter",no legs.

263
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
Jon Voight was "Coming Home",couldn't feel his legs.

264
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
You've got it totally the other wayaround, my friend. Jon Voight...

265
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
- Honey?- What?

266
00:13:31 --> 00:13:32
Shall we?

267
00:13:32 --> 00:13:33
It's not gonna happen.

268
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
They're doing it tonight.We can do it tomorrow.

269
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
In the future, if I could seethe schedule beforehand...

270
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
So when I woke up this morning...

271
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
...he'd stolen all the insolesout of my shoes!

272
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49
Why?

273
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
He thinks I slept with hisex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

274
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
Why would you kill his fish?

275
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
Because sometimesafter you sleep with someone...

276
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
...you have to kill a fish.

277
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
Chandler, honey...

278
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
...I'm sorry.

279
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

280
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
Wait. He's not here yet.

281
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
He knows what happens.

282
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
I'm fine about my problem now,by the way.

283
00:14:16 --> 00:14:17
Amber...

284
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
... I'll always be there for you...

285
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
... as a friend and as your brother.

286
00:14:22 --> 00:14:23
Oh, Drake.

287
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
Hard day, huh?

288
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
First the medical award, now this?

289
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
Some guys are just lucky, I guess.

290
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
first floor Emergency stat.

291
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
Well, then...

292
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
...I guess that's me.

293
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
Anyone else need to go on the elevator?Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?

294
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
They only said you.

295
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
Oh, okay. All right.

296
00:14:49 --> 00:14:50
I love you.

297
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
Yeah, whatever.

298
00:14:52 --> 00:14:53
Oh, no!

299
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
Drake, look out!

300
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
- Did they just kill off Joey?- No!

301
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
Now maybe.

302
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
Come on! Open up!We want to talk to you!

303
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
I don't feel like talking!

304
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
Come on! We care about you.

305
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
- We're worried about you.- And some of us really have to pee!

306
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
I'm sorry, Joey.

307
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
Listen, sorry about your death.That really sucks.

308
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
- We came over as soon as we saw.- How could you not tell us?

309
00:15:25 --> 00:15:29
I don't know. I was kind of hopingno one would ever find out.

310
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
Well, maybe they could finda way to bring you back.

311
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
They said that when they found my body,my brain was so smashed in...

312
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
...that the only doctorwho could've saved me was me.

313
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
It's supposed to besome kind of irony.

314
00:15:44 --> 00:15:45
But Joey, you're gonna be fine.

315
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
You don't need that show.It was just a dumb soap opera.

316
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
This was the greatest thingthat ever happened to me.

317
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

318
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
Here's Monica.She'll have something nice to say.

319
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
I straightened out your shower curtainso you won't get mildew.

320
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
What? To me, that's nice.

321
00:16:05 --> 00:16:06
It'll be okay. You know that.

322
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
No, I don't.

323
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
It's like you workyour whole life for something...

324
00:16:12 --> 00:16:13
...and you thinkthat when you get it...

325
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
...it'll never beas good as you thought.

326
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
But this so was.

327
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
It changed everything.

328
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Like, the other day,I got this credit card application...

329
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
...and I was pre-approved!

330
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
I've never been pre-approvedfor anything in my life!

331
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
I'm sorry, man.

332
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
I don't know if this'll meananything to you...

333
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
...but you'll always bepre-approved with us.

334
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
That means nothing to me.

335
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

336
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
Yeah, all right.

337
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
Are these raisins?

338
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
Sure, why not?

339
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
Listen, Eddie.

340
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
I've been thinking aboutour living situation.

341
00:17:02 --> 00:17:03
Why are you smiling?

342
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
I got a little surprise.Look. There's a new fishy.

343
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
I named him...

344
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
...Chandler, you know, after you.

345
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
Well, that's not even a real fish.

346
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.

347
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
So what's your point, man?

348
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
Okay, good night.

349
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
You big freak of nature!

350
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
- Brisk tonight.- Oh, man.

351
00:17:57 --> 00:18:00
- Let's never speak of this.- You got it.
