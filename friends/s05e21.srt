1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
I'll get coffee.Want anything, baby doll?

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
I'm fine. Thanks.

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
I can't pull off "baby doll", can I?

4
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
No, I think we learned thatfrom the "sugar lips" incident.

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
I'll make some tea.

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
How you doing, pumpkin?

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
- So it's going well for you two?- I know. Really well.

8
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
I'm gonna ask Phoebeto move in with me.

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
What do you think?

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
It's great!When will you ask her?

11
00:00:24 --> 00:00:25
Tonight. But don't say anything.

12
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
I swear. I promise.

13
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
I'm so excited!

14
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
But listen, do notget her flowers, okay?

15
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
Because she cries when they die.Then there's the whole funeral.

16
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
- I'll see you after work, sweetie.- Okay. Bye.

17
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
So what movie should we see?

18
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
Gary's gonna ask youto move in with him!

19
00:00:44 --> 00:00:44
What? Really?

20
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
He made me promise not to tell,but I couldn't hold it in any longer!

21
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
I can't believe this.

22
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Right? Because it's fast.Because it's so fast. It's fast.

23
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.

24
00:00:56 --> 00:00:57
Good for you, Pheebs.Way to go.

25
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
No, but it is fast, isn't it?

26
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
- I like him but I'm not ready.- So what are you gonna do?

27
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
I don't know. I'll just handle it.I'll ask you to talk to him!

28
00:01:06 --> 00:01:07
Me? Why me?

29
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
Because you areso afraid of commitment.

30
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
You talk to him. Make him scaredlike you, make him a man.

31
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
I'll try, but I'm not surewhat good it'd do.

32
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
I'm less afraid of commitmentthan I used to be.

33
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
That is so sweet.

34
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
Still terrified.I'll take care of it.

35
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
The One with the Ball

36
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
Hey, Ross, is Staten Islandreally an island?

37
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
That's why they call itStaten "Island".

38
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
Oh, I thought it waslike Long Island.

39
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
Also an island.

40
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
What time is it?

41
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
2: 17.

42
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
We haven't droppedthis ball for an hour.

43
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
Are you serious?

44
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
I realized it a half-hour ago,but I didn't say anything.

45
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
I didn't wanna jinx it.

46
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
We are pretty good at this.

47
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
We totally forgot about lunch.

48
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
That's the first timeI've ever missed a meal.

49
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
I think my pants are a little loose.

50
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
Hey, you guys. Is Monica here?

51
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
I bought something.I'm not sure she'll like it.

52
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
It may seem crazy, but I've wantedthis since I was a little girl.

53
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
You bought Shaun Cassidy!

54
00:02:56 --> 00:02:57
No. I wish!

55
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
Okay, you ready?

56
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
Check it out.

57
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
What is it?

58
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
What the hell is that?

59
00:03:11 --> 00:03:12
It's a cat.

60
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
That is not a cat!

61
00:03:14 --> 00:03:15
Yes, it is!

62
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
Why is it inside out?

63
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
Excuse me!

64
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
But this is a purebred,show-quality sphinx cat.

65
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
How much did you pay for that?

66
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
It was extravagant,but I got a good deal.

67
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
- How much?- Thousand bucks.

68
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
On a cat?

69
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
It's not a cat!

70
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
All right. Listen, ball boys.

71
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
My grandma had one when I was little.It was the sweetest thing.

72
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
It would sit in my lapand just purr all day long.

73
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
I would drag a stringand it would chase it.

74
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
Free cats do that too, you know.

75
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
It's not a cat!

76
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
I'm really excited about this, okay?I don't care what you think.

77
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
I'm gonna set up a litter boxfor Mrs. Whiskerson.

78
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
What am I gonna call her?Fluffy?

79
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
Do you wanna get something to eator see how long we can throw this ball?

80
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
The ball thing.

81
00:04:10 --> 00:04:15
Wouldn't it be great if we could gofor two hours without dropping it?

82
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
Yeah, it would!

83
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
Let's do it.

84
00:04:23 --> 00:04:24
I have to pee.

85
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
And Rachel's in the bathroom!

86
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
Man, I didn't think we'd make it.

87
00:04:33 --> 00:04:34
I know.

88
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
Don't switch hands, okay?

89
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
Hey, ladies.What are you in here for?

90
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
What are you doing here?

91
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
I am here to report a crime.

92
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
It's a crime thatwe don't spend time together.

93
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
What's up?

94
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
You're thinking about moving in withPhoebe, and I thought we should talk.

95
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
You know, man to...

96
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
...well, me.

97
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
Sure, okay.

98
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
Are you crazy?

99
00:05:05 --> 00:05:06
Are you insane?

100
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
If you live with Phoebe, you twoare gonna be living together.

101
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
I considered that.It'd make me happy.

102
00:05:12 --> 00:05:13
You mean scared.

103
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
No, I mean happy.

104
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
Scared happy.

105
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
What are you doing?

106
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
I'm trying to open your eyes!

107
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
If you live with Phoebe,she is always gonna be there.

108
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
You get home, she's there.You go to bed, she's there.

109
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
You wake up and oh, yes, she's there.

110
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
I know. I can't wait!

111
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
Were your parents happy or something?

112
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
I was lucky enough to findsomeone that I really love.

113
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
I just want to be around heras much as I can.

114
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
When you say it,it doesn't sound so scary.

115
00:05:40 --> 00:05:41
You know what I'm saying?

116
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
Yeah, I think I do.

117
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
You know what?

118
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
Move in with her. Move in right now.Maybe I'll move in with Monica.

119
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
No, it's too soon for you guys.

120
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
You're right about that.

121
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
When they found the remainsof the Mesozoic mastodon...

122
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
...they discovered what appearedto be the remains...

123
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.

124
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
How did it get there?

125
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
Maybe this should be moreof a quiet game.

126
00:06:10 --> 00:06:11
Hey, guys.

127
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
I left my watch here last night.

128
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
- It was here. Where is it?- I don't know.

129
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
I'm late for work.

130
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
How do you know?You don't have a watch.

131
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
Can you stop throwing the ballfor one minute and help me find it?

132
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
Oh, I don't know...Yeah, can't do it.

133
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
- What?- Do not drop that ball.

134
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
We haven't dropped it in...

135
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Two hours, 27 minutes.

136
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
Really?

137
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
I won't make it in to work today.

138
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
I don't feel very good.

139
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
For a second, I thought I wasfeeling better, but I'm not.

140
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
Hey, Rach.

141
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
Check it out. Almost three hourswithout dropping it.

142
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
Congratulations.That's quite a waste of time.

143
00:06:57 --> 00:06:58
You have scratches all over you.

144
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
Well, it's my cat.

145
00:07:01 --> 00:07:01
Oh, I got a cat.

146
00:07:02 --> 00:07:02
I don't want a cat!

147
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Don't worry, it's not a cat.

148
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
You guys, this cat is nothinglike my grandmother's cat.

149
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
It's not sweet.It's not cute.

150
00:07:10 --> 00:07:15
I dragged a string, and it flipped outand scratched the hell out of me.

151
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
I know this sounds crazy,but every time this cat hisses at me...

152
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
...I know it's saying, "Rachel!"

153
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
Doesn't sound as crazyas paying $1000 for a cat.

154
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
You paid $1000 for a catwhen you owe me $300?

155
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
Well, I was gonna let youplay with it.

156
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
Did you talk to Garyabout moving in?

157
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
I think you should do it.

158
00:07:44 --> 00:07:49
He's a great guy and he loves youa lot. You are a very lucky lady.

159
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
You are useless!

160
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
Freaking out about commitmentis the one thing you can do...

161
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
...and you can't even do that right!

162
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
Sorry. If he asked me,I'd move in with him.

163
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
Get out of here, good-for-nothing.

164
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
Hey, Chandler.

165
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Hey, Gar.

166
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
Hey, sweetie.

167
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
Can I talk to you for a second?

168
00:08:14 --> 00:08:14
You look pretty today.

169
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
Thanks. Okay.

170
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
Here's the thing.

171
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
I really want this relationshipto move forward.

172
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
If you're not moving forward,you're moving backwards.

173
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
No, if you're not moving forward,you're staying still.

174
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
And staying still is good.Watch this.

175
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
I want you to move in with me.

176
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
That is so sweet.

177
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
But don't you thinkit's too soon?

178
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
There's so much we don't knowabout each other.

179
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
Okay. I get it.

180
00:08:45 --> 00:08:49
I don't want us to jump into somethingthat we're not ready for.

181
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
I don't wantto mess up what we have.

182
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
I'm worried it's gonnabe a big mistake.

183
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
Which is why my answer is yes!

184
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
Really?

185
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
You're so happy.

186
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
Monica, stop throwing it so hard!

187
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
We're on the same team!

188
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
You guys have been doing thisfor four hours?

189
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
That's right, baby.

190
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
- All right. Let me in.- No, no! Don't do it!

191
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
What?

192
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
He's a dropper.

193
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
Oh, yeah. That's right!

194
00:09:30 --> 00:09:31
I'm not a dropper!

195
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
It's really a three-persongame, you know?

196
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
It's throwing and catching.

197
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
All right.

198
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
Oh, it's so hard.

199
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
Don't worry, guys.It's not a cat.

200
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
Oh, good God!

201
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
I give up. I don't know whatI'm gonna do with this thing.

202
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
Baking it didn't help?

203
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
Take it back to where you got it.

204
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
I tried. They won't take her back.

205
00:10:05 --> 00:10:09
Maybe that's because she'sa minion of the Antichrist.

206
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
Why won't they take it?

207
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
They said they would onlygive me store credit.

208
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
What am I gonna do?Get 1000 regular cats?

209
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
You can keep it until youfind out what to do with it.

210
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
That's not the point.I'm out $1000...

211
00:10:21 --> 00:10:22
...I'm all scratched up...

212
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
...and I'm stuck with this stupid catthat looks like a hand!

213
00:10:28 --> 00:10:29
Oh, my God!

214
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
The cat's made my eyes water.Don't throw it to me!

215
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
My vision's been compromised!

216
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
Oh, God! Okay.

217
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
It's okay. Man, that was close.

218
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
Yeah, you almost overreactedto something.

219
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
- We have great news.- We're moving in together. Yea!

220
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
Congratulations.

221
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
- I'm so excited!- So am I.

222
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
You're not more excited than I am.No way. I'm the most excited.

223
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
See you at the station later.

224
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
I'll see you later.Don't forget about the moving-in!

225
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
So you're moving in with him?

226
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.Maybe it'll be all right.

227
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
I do like him a lot...

228
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
...and probably do iteventually, anyway.

229
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
Plus think of all the moneyI'll save on stamps.

230
00:11:11 --> 00:11:12
Do you write him a lot?

231
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
I heard when people live together...

232
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
...they split the costof stamps, don't they?

233
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
- Yeah, yeah.- That's right.

234
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
Sorry, the oven mittsreally freaked me out.

235
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
Hey, honey.

236
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
Did you find any apartmentsin Brooklyn Heights?

237
00:11:35 --> 00:11:36
No, nothing.

238
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
- Oh, really?- Yeah.

239
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
- Nothing at all?- No.

240
00:11:39 --> 00:11:43
If something opens up, we'll move in.If it has a pool. I need a pool.

241
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
Can I talk to you?

242
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
Take a seat.

243
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
You okay?

244
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
You feel all right?

245
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
I feel great becausewe're moving in together.

246
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
So you...

247
00:11:58 --> 00:12:02
You checked the paper for listingsin Brooklyn Heights, right?

248
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
You checked the "Post"?

249
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
Yeah, there was nothing.

250
00:12:07 --> 00:12:07
Can I get some water?

251
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
In a minute.

252
00:12:10 --> 00:12:11
You checked today's "Post"?

253
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
Yeah, today's.

254
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
Because this is today's "Post".

255
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
And these are the listings I found.

256
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.

257
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,Brooklyn Heights!

258
00:12:24 --> 00:12:28
Oh, are these for rent?I thought people were just bragging.

259
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
Let me tell you what's going on here.

260
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
Don't look at the table.Look at me.

261
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
Somebody asked someoneto move in with him.

262
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
Someone said yes,but now she has doubts...

263
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
...because things are moving too fast.Does that sound possible?

264
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
Yes, fine! I am someone!

265
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
You want me to say it?I have doubts!

266
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
I'm sorry!

267
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
It's okay that you feel this way.

268
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
It is soon and there's thingswe don't know about each other.

269
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
Everything I know about you,I really like.

270
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
Things I don't know, I'll learn ina place with our names on the mailbox.

271
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
That's so sweet.

272
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
But if it's too soon for you,we don't have to do it.

273
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
I want you to be happy.

274
00:13:13 --> 00:13:14
Living with you would make me happy.

275
00:13:14 --> 00:13:15
You don't have to say that.

276
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
I want to live with you.I want to move in with you.

277
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
Are you sure?

278
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
Definitely, yes! Let's live inan apartment we both live in.

279
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
Oh, that's great.

280
00:13:24 --> 00:13:25
Oh, wait, one sec.

281
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
Hey, you! Behind the glass.Who are you looking at?

282
00:13:29 --> 00:13:34
I always wanted to say that every timeI was in these rooms, which was never.

283
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
Show cat!

284
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
Quality show cat!

285
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
Show cat!

286
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
Oh, my God!

287
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
What's wrong with your baby?

288
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
That's not a baby. That's a cat.

289
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
- It's creepy looking.- Oh, no.

290
00:13:47 --> 00:13:51
It's actually very sweet.It's very sweet. Look.

291
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
Yeah. Do you want it?

292
00:13:54 --> 00:13:55
No, I hate cats.

293
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
Then what are you doing to me?

294
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
Get out of here, all right?Move on!

295
00:14:01 --> 00:14:02
What an unusual cat.

296
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
Yes, thank you! Exactly.You want it?

297
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
Maybe.

298
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
I was thinking about getting a catfrom the shelter, but...

299
00:14:09 --> 00:14:09
Okay. Why not?

300
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.

301
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
- What?- Okay, 1000.

302
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
Didn't you want me to adopt your cat?

303
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
I do, but you'll have to look at thisas more of an investment than a cat.

304
00:14:20 --> 00:14:23
Okay, yeah.I just wanted a cat.

305
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
Obviously, you know how to haggle,so I won't try and take you on.

306
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
So $800, and I don't call the copsbecause you are robbing me blind!

307
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
Blind! Just take the cat.Leave the money. Run away!

308
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
Run away. Damn it!

309
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
Can't you at least smile or something?

310
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
Did anybody just hear that? Anybody?

311
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
- I'm starving.- Come on, guys. Suck it up!

312
00:14:52 --> 00:14:53
We're closing in on 10 hours.

313
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
It's gut-check time!

314
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
I don't know who made you the boss.We invented this game.

315
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
I made this game what it is!

316
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
Not fun anymore?

317
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
I'm still hungry.

318
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
There's pizza at my place. We can eatwith one hand. Are you with me?

319
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
- I am.- All right, let's go! Come on!

320
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
Let's go, Team Monica!

321
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
We can work out the name later.

322
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
What is your cat doing in my bowl?

323
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
I'm defrosting a chicken.

324
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
I sold Mrs. Whiskerson.

325
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Thank God!

326
00:15:27 --> 00:15:28
Get your money back?

327
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
Yeah, $1500.

328
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
You made a profit?

329
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
I just came for the red velvet pillow.

330
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
- There you go.- Thanks, Rachel.

331
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
Don't forget, you can comevisit her anytime.

332
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
Oh, good. Great.I'll keep that in mind.

333
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
So is this some kindof snake or something?

334
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
I like waking up with you.

335
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
I like waking up with you too.

336
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.

337
00:16:04 --> 00:16:05
I could stay here all day.

338
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
That would be great.

339
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
- We could have breakfast in bed.- Wait, just a second.

340
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
Oh, no.

341
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
All right. Come on, Monica!Look alive. Come on!

342
00:16:23 --> 00:16:24
Oh, good. You're all up.

343
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
It's six o'clock in the morning.Why aren't you at Gary's?

344
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
Oh, yeah. That's over.

345
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
Gary's such a great guy.You can work it out.

346
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
- He shot a bird.- That is over.

347
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
- I'm sorry.- That's terrible.

348
00:16:36 --> 00:16:37
Are you okay?

349
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
I'll be all right.

350
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
Here, Pheebs.

351
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
I don't feel like playing.

352
00:16:46 --> 00:16:46
It's okay.

353
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
It's okay.

354
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
It didn't happen.No one needs to know.

355
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
She's not an official ball player.

356
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
Only official ball playerscan drop the ball.

357
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
- Come on.- Let's go.

358
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
You wanna get breakfast?

359
00:17:00 --> 00:17:01
Okay, let's race!

360
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
First one there wins.

361
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
You guys wanna eat here?

362
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
That was great, huh?

363
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
Can you believe how long we did it?

364
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
It is amazing it lasted that long.

365
00:17:17 --> 00:17:18
My arm is killing me.

366
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
No, I meant withthe dropper over here.

367
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
How did I get thisreputation as a dropper?

368
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
I am anything but a dropper.

369
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
Ross!
