00:00:01 --> 00:00:01
I deliver perfection...and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
Stocks and bonds are moving higher...

4
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
Why are we watchingthe Business Channel?

5
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
Because the other day I saw there wasa stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

6
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Sometimes it takes two or three hoursbefore it comes up again.

7
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
But when it does, it's exciting.

8
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
Okay, honey, you really need a job.

9
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
Dad says he knows someoneyou can call for an interview.

10
00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
Right there! That's the thirdsign today. Right there.

11
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
On behalf of everyone,I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

12
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
No, you just said "dad".And everywhere I go today...

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
...I keep getting signstelling me to go see my father.

14
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
Like when I was walking over hereand I passed a buffet.

15
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
Which is my father's last name.

16
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
And they were serving franks...

17
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
...which is his first nameminus the "s" at the end.

18
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
And there was a rotisseriewith a spinning chicken.

19
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
His Indian name?

20
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
No. Because I chickened outthe last time...

21
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
...when I tried to meet him.So coincidences? I don't think so.

22
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
- Very freaky.- Eerie.

23
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
Who wants the last hamburger?

24
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
That's it.Now I have to go see him.

25
00:01:02 --> 00:01:03
Why?

26
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
Hamburger? McDonald's?

27
00:01:06 --> 00:01:10
Old McDonald had a farm.My dad is a pharmacist.

28
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13

30
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
Man, I am so beat.

31
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
You wanna forget racquetballand hang out?

32
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
Yeah, all right.

33
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
- Hey, you're in our seats.- Sorry, we didn't know.

34
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
We were sitting there.

35
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
Okay.There is one more way to say it.

36
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
Who knows it?

37
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
- Was that supposed to be funny?- Actually, I was going for colorful.

38
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
- What's with this guy?- What's with you?

39
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
Nothing. Nothing's with him.

40
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Enjoy your coffee.

41
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
What just happened?

42
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
I just took your hat.See, I can be funny too.

43
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
My joke is that I took your hat.

44
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
That is funny.

45
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Can I have it back?

46
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
You know what?I think you're very funny.

47
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
Kudos on that hat joke.

48
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
But come on, guys,just give him back the hat.

49
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
Why should we?

50
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
Because it's a special hat.

51
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
He bought it becausehe was feeling down one day.

52
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
So he got the hat...

53
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
...to cheer himself up, you know?

54
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
- Chandler...- Stop talking. Stop talking now.

55
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
Let me get this straight.You're stealing my hat?

56
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
You got a problem?

57
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
I just want to make surewe're on the same page.

58
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
How'd the interview go?

59
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
It bit.

60
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
It was a '50s theme restaurant.

61
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
I'd have to cook in a costumeand dance on the counter.

62
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
I was a sous chefat "Café des Artistes".

63
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
How can I take a job where I haveto make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

64
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
- Don't do it.- How can I not do it?

65
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
I have $ 127 in the bank!

66
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

67
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
I don't want a beer.

68
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
Who said it was for you?

69
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
What's the matter?

70
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
Some mean guys at the coffeehousetook my hat.

71
00:03:43 --> 00:03:44
- No!- You're kidding?

72
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
It was ridiculous.These guys were bullies.

73
00:03:47 --> 00:03:48
Actual bullies.

74
00:03:48 --> 00:03:53
We're grownups. This kind of stuffisn't supposed to happen anymore.

75
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
Oh, no, wait a minute.I have no one.

76
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
Let's go down thereand get your hat back.

77
00:04:01 --> 00:04:06
Forget it. It's probably strippedand sold for parts by now.

78
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
- I went up!- What?

79
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

80
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
Do you realize that if I'd investedmy $ 127 in myself yesterday...

81
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
...that I'd, like, havea lot more than that today.

82
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
You know what?I'm going to do it.

83
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
- Do what?- Put all my money in me.

84
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
You don't know a thingabout the stock market.

85
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
What's to know?Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

86
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
Yes, Manhattan.

87
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
Telephone number for the stock...

88
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
...selling store.

89
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
See? I told you these pillowswould be a good idea.

90
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
Oh, God.

91
00:04:46 --> 00:04:47
Here we go.

92
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
For the first time in my life,I'm gonna say, "Hi, Birth Father!"

93
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
- We love you. We're here for you.- Good luck.

94
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Thanks.

95
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?

96
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
What is in that?

97
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

98
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
No, because mayo,that would make it gross.

99
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
- Run, Phoebe, run!- No, no, doggy, please!

100
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
I do so want to love all animals.Please, no. Back off!

101
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
- You got a bone?- Are you kidding?

102
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
Look, kibbles! Bits!

103
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
Get the hell off my leg,you yippity piece of crap!

104
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

105
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
Why don't you take his trampoline?

106
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
Okay, here, I know what we can do.

107
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

108
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
Go get the sandwich!Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

109
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
The dog will lick himselfbut he will not touch your sandwich.

110
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
What does that tell you?

111
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
- Lf he's not going to eat it, I will.- Are you crazy?

112
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
He's just a little dog.

113
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
- Hey.- What?

114
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
Do you have to be a Century 21real-estate agent...

115
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
...to get to wear those cool jackets?

116
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
Do you say this stuff to girls?

117
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Isn't that the guywho used to wear your hat?

118
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
And look where they're sitting.

119
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
You're joking, right?You guys just walked through the door.

120
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

121
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
This couch belongs to us.

122
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
I'll tell you what,you call the couch...

123
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
...and then we'll call the couch...

124
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
...and we'll see who it comes to.

125
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
You know, I keep wonderingwhy you two are still sitting here.

126
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
All right, that's it.

127
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
I have had enough of this.

128
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
Gunther.

129
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
These guys are tryingto take our seat.

130
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Fellas, these guys were here first.

131
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Oh, sorry, didn't realize.

132
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
There you go.

133
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
Thank you, Gunther.

134
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
We didn't want to haveto go and do that.

135
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
He told on us?

136
00:06:56 --> 00:06:56
You told on us?

137
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
Well, pal, you didn'tgive me much of a choice.

138
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
- Don't play with his thing.- I know.

139
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
All right.

140
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
Let's take this outside.

141
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
"Let's take this outside?"

142
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
Who talks like that?

143
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
The guy who's about to kick your asstalks like that.

144
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
You had to ask.

145
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
Okay, okay, look. See...

146
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
...the thing is, we're not gonnafight you guys.

147
00:07:30 --> 00:07:31
Here's the deal.

148
00:07:31 --> 00:07:36
You won't have to, so long as younever ever show your faces here again.

149
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
I think you playedthe Gunther card too soon.

150
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

151
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
Yeah, I don't know.

152
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
What's the matter?

153
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
I just think that this wasa really bad sign.

154
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
Like the beast at the threshold.

155
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
It's just I have no family left,except for my grandmother.

156
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
But let's face it, she's notgonna be around forever.

157
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
Despite what she says.

158
00:08:07 --> 00:08:12
And I have a sister who I've barelyspoken to since we shared a womb.

159
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
I don't know. This is my real father...

160
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
...and I want things to be,like, just right.

161
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
I completely understand.

162
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
Whatever you need.

163
00:08:21 --> 00:08:22
Hey, you want to go home?

164
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
Okay, thanks. Sorry, again.

165
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
What was that?

166
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

167
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
I want to buy five shares of SGJ.Now.

168
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
Come on, time is money, my friend!

169
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
Thank you!

170
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
"Time is money, my friend?"

171
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
You missed"Takes money to make money"...

172
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
...and "Don't make me come down thereand kick your Wall Street butt."

173
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
I made $ 17 before breakfast.What have you done?

174
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
I had breakfast here,so technically I saved $3.50.

175
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
How did you make $ 17?

176
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
Well, my financiallychallenged friends...

177
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
...I split my money and I boughtsome shares of CHP and ZXY.

178
00:09:18 --> 00:09:19
How come those?

179
00:09:19 --> 00:09:24
Well, CHP because I used to have acrush on Erik Estrada.

180
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
And ZXY because I thinkit sounds "zexy".

181
00:09:28 --> 00:09:29
What happened to MEG?

182
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

183
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
My motto is, "Get outbefore they go down."

184
00:09:35 --> 00:09:39
That is so not my motto.

185
00:09:43 --> 00:09:43
How's the dog?

186
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
Okay. I talked to the vet.People are so nice upstate.

187
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
He said the little fella's gonna beokay, and I can get him tomorrow.

188
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
- Good.- Thank God.

189
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
But he did have to havea bunch of stitches.

190
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
And he said that only once in a bluemoon does a dog's ear grow back.

191
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
So still hoping.

192
00:10:01 --> 00:10:05
Now are you going to call your dadto let him know that his dog is okay?

193
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
I don't want to meet my fatherover the phone.

194
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
What will I say,"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned."

195
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
"Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."

196
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

197
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
Listen, just don't say anythingabout me, okay?

198
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
Don't...

199
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
...be too long with the phone.

200
00:10:25 --> 00:10:29
She'll be a much better friendonce the market closes.

201
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
It's a woman.

202
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
So talk to her.

203
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
Hello, Mrs. Buffay.

204
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
I know where your dog is.

205
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
I want you to know he'll be returnedto you almost as good as new...

206
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
...within 24 hours.

207
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
Goodbye.

208
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
- Why the voice?- Hard to say.

209
00:10:56 --> 00:10:57
Your cappuccino, sir.

210
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
Thank you.

211
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
- This is better than the coffeehouse.- Absolutely.

212
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
How come it's not mixingwith the water?

213
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
The package says to keep it moving.

214
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

215
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
This is ridiculous.

216
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
After I get back frommy niece's christening...

217
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
...I'll go to the coffeehouse with youand we'll have a cup of coffee.

218
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
No problem. Joey's there.

219
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
I don't want to have to have Joey withme every time I want decent coffee.

220
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
And I don't want to drinkcappuccino with a "k".

221
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
I say you and I goand stand up to those guys.

222
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
All right, hang ona second there, Custer.

223
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
Ross, have you everbeen beaten up before?

224
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
Yeah, sure.

225
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
By someone besides Monica?

226
00:11:55 --> 00:11:56
So what?

227
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
So we get beaten up. Maybe that'ssomething a man has to go through.

228
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
Like a rite of passage or something.

229
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
Couldn't we just loseour virginities again?

230
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
Because I think actuallymine's growing back.

231
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
- I need $ 100.- What?

232
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
Welcome home.

233
00:12:13 --> 00:12:14
- I need $ 100.- For what?

234
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
- To get back in the game.- When did you get out?

235
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
I lost it all. I lost it.

236
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
I've come to terms with it,you have to, too.

237
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.

238
00:12:27 --> 00:12:28
Where are we on the $ 100?

239
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
I don't have it.

240
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
But I need it!

241
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
Otherwise, I'll have totake that diner job.

242
00:12:33 --> 00:12:38
You know, with the dancingand the costumes.

243
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
I don't want to have to wearflame-retardant boobs.

244
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
Nobody does, honey.

245
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
Noodle!

246
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
Oh, my God. What the hellhappened to my dog?

247
00:12:53 --> 00:12:54
It was an accident.

248
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
And the woman who did thiswould never hurt a dog on purpose.

249
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
She's a vegetarian.

250
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
Are these stitches?

251
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
Yeah, eight of them.That's 56 to him.

252
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
If it's raining, you can'tlet him look up...

253
00:13:06 --> 00:13:09
...because that conewill fill up fast.

254
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
Thanks for bringing backwhat's left of him.

255
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
- Is Frank home?- How do you know Frank?

256
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
Just from a long time ago.Is he here?

257
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
What?

258
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
I mean Frank Senior.

259
00:13:25 --> 00:13:26
He went out for groceries.

260
00:13:26 --> 00:13:27
Will he be back soon?

261
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
He left four years ago.We're expecting him back any minute.

262
00:13:32 --> 00:13:33
I'm gonna go.

263
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
I'm sorry about the dog.Everything.

264
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
Hey, lady!

266
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
Hey, wait up!

267
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
- How do you know my dad?- Well, I don't really.

268
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
Just genetically.

269
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
He's kind of my dad too.

270
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
Heavy.

271
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56
So did he ever talk about me... Phoebe?

272
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
No, but he didn't really talkabout anything.

273
00:14:01 --> 00:14:02
Except stilts.

274
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
- Stilts?- Yeah, he loved stilts.

275
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
One time, I was upstairs stealingcigarettes out of my mom's purse...

276
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
...and all of a sudden I look over...

277
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
...and there's Dad's head,bobbing past the window.

278
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
He just had this big smile on his faceand he was waving...

279
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
...because he was happiestwhen he was on his stilts.

280
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
I don't know what to do with that.

281
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
Me neither.

282
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
So are you, like, my big sister?

283
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
This is huge. You can buy me beer!

284
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
I'm not gonna.

285
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
But you know what's cool? If you hada friend named Pete, I could say...

286
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
..."I know Pete.He's friends with my brother."

287
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
- I got a friend named Mark.- That'll work too.

288
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
Cool. All right.

289
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
So maybe, you know,I could give you a call sometime.

290
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
We could talk or something.

291
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
- Yeah, that'd be okay.- All right.

292
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
I'm in the book.

293
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
So stilts, huh?

294
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
If you want, I can show you wherehe hit his head on the rain gutter.

295
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
We did it. We're here.We are standing our ground.

296
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
- How long does coffee take?- Would you come on? Come on!

297
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
Thank you.

298
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
- There we go.- I think we proved our point.

299
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
- You burn your mouth?- Cannot feel my tongue.

300
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
Bullies! Big bullies!

301
00:15:38 --> 00:15:42
Look who's here.It's the weenies.

302
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
Did we not make ourselves clearthe other day?

303
00:15:44 --> 00:15:45
That's why we're here.

304
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
Yes, we're standing our ground.

305
00:15:48 --> 00:15:49
Apparently.

306
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
Let's do this already.

307
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
You got a weapon?

308
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
A nice watch.I don't want to break it on your ribs.

309
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
All right, let's do this.

310
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
Question: If I don't care aboutmy watch, can I use it as a weapon?

311
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
- What do you mean?- It's sharp, it's metal.

312
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
I think I can do someserious damage with it.

313
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
No, you can't use your watch.

314
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
Or your keys.

315
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
Here's what we'll do.

316
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
We'll put all keys and watchesin the hat over there.

317
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
All right?

318
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

319
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

320
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

321
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
I have to work on Monday.I have a big presentation.

322
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
Actually, I gotta showthis apartment tomorrow...

323
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
...and this no-faces thingmight not be a bad idea.

324
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
Nothing from the neck up.

325
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
Or the waist down.

326
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
- Dana's ovulating.- Really? You guys trying again?

327
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
Let me get this straight.We're talking about the middle?

328
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
Come on!

329
00:16:46 --> 00:16:51
You want a piece of this?I'm standing here!

330
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
Those guys are taking our stuff!

331
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
God, that was amazing.That was incredible.

332
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
- You guys kicked butt!- Us? What about you guys?

333
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
You really gave it toold Mr. Clean back there.

334
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
- He was a big guy.- Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

335
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
I wouldn't know,having missed everything.

336
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
Don't do that to yourself.

337
00:17:09 --> 00:17:14
Any one of us could have trippedover that little girl's jump rope.

338
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
So listen, guys...

339
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
...are we okay here?

340
00:17:20 --> 00:17:21
We're okay.

341
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
So can I have my hat back?

342
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
Oh, my God. Look at her.

343
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
Hi, Monica!

344
00:17:41 --> 00:17:42
How's it going?

345
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
Hey, nice boobs.

346
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
Guys, guys. Check this out.

347
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
Excellent.
