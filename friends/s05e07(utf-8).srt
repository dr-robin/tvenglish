1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
No, look.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
That's a pig.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
I know.But look at the knobs on it!

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Emily's cousin kicked me out.

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:19
- What?- Why?

7
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
When you subletfrom your wife's cousin...

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
...then you divorce, sometimesthe cousin wants his apartment back.

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
Didn't you sign a lease?

10
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
You can stay with us.

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:33
Anything you need.

13
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
But you have to let us knowwhen you feel better...

14
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
...so we can make fun of your hair.

15
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
You got it.

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
Thanks, I really appreciate this.I'm going to get packing again.

17
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
I've been moving around so muchthat I feel like a nomad.

18
00:00:51 --> 00:00:54
He thought you said gonad.

19
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
The One Where Ross Moves In

20
00:01:35 --> 00:01:38
If every place were this clean,it'd be tough making a living.

21
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
Oh, Larry!

22
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
Do health inspectorswork on commission?

23
00:01:42 --> 00:01:43
No, bribes.

24
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
- It's okay to laugh?- I was just kidding.

25
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
- I'll check the kitchen floor.- Knock yourself out.

26
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
Yummy!

27
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
Yeah, I'd let him check outmy kitchen floor.

28
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
A ninety-eight.

29
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
I deducted two pointsfor not wearing your hat.

30
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
That is a Section 5 violation.

31
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
Now look, Larry, honey.

32
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
I wrote the book on Section 5.

33
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
You only need to wear itin the kitchen.

34
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
Where's your hat?

35
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
In the kitchen. I'll get it.

36
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
There's the two points!

37
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
You should really readthat book you wrote.

38
00:02:25 --> 00:02:29
You saw the hat in the kitchen andknew she'd go in hatless to get it.

39
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
You could have your ownhealth inspector detective show.

40
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
I don't know about that.

41
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
But then I could beyour sidekick, Voonda.

42
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
Maybe I could ask Voondato dinner sometime?

43
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
She would love that...

44
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
...since you knowall the clean places to eat.

45
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
I'll call you.

46
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
He's so funny!

47
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
Thank you.

48
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
How's Ross doingsince all the Emily stuff?

49
00:03:03 --> 00:03:04
He's not great.

50
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
But he's dealing with it.Wait, you're not...

51
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
I can't get startedwith all that Ross stuff again.

52
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
He'll be screwed up for a long time.

53
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
Besides, I don't go for guysright after they get divorced.

54
00:03:15 --> 00:03:20
Right, you only go for themfive minutes before they get married.

55
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
- Two pounds of mocha java.- It's Danny.

56
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
Are you going to go out again?

57
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
I don't know.He hasn't called since we went out.

58
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
I see him in the hallway.We flirt. I'm all...

59
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
...and then nothing.

60
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
Wow, thirsty.

61
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
I'm having a party on Saturday.Sort of a housewarming thing.

62
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
- Fun.- Great!

63
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
I'm looking forward to it.

64
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
See you!

65
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
So I guess we won'tbe warming his house.

66
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
All right, I see what he's doing.

67
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
He's not asking me outbecause he wants me to ask him out.

68
00:03:57 --> 00:03:57
And you won't do that.

69
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
That's right!

70
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
Because that would give himthe control.

71
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
So now he comes up with this"I've got a party" thing...

72
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
...to get me to hintfor an invitation.

73
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
Blew up in his face, didn't it?

74
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
So there is no party?

75
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
No, there's a party.There's a party.

76
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
But the power?

77
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
That is still up for grabs.

78
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
You follow me?

79
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
I think so.

80
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
So he won't invite you to his partybecause he likes you?

81
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
Exactly!

82
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
Hey, roomies!

83
00:04:37 --> 00:04:38
I love what you've donewith the place.

84
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
I know it's a lot of boxes.

85
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
- I appreciate you letting me stay here.- Not a problem.

86
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
Since you'll be here a while...

87
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
...we could put your nameon the answering machine.

88
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
I hope you don't mind...

89
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
...but I kind of alreadyjazzed it up a little.

90
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Check it out.

91
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
We will

92
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
We will call you back

93
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
Pretty cool.

94
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
- You're fake laughing too, right?- The tears are real.

95
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
You look beautiful this evening.

96
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
Show me the badge again.

97
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
Shiny.

98
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
You mind if I wash up?Who knows where these have been?

99
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
You are just nonstop!

100
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
- We're out of here.- Why?

101
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
I saw ten violations.I'm shutting this place down!

102
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
- You have the power to do that?- This does.

103
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
Shut it down.

104
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
What are you doing?

105
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
Nothing.

106
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
You built a fort, didn't you?

107
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
Kind of.

108
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Oh, my God! The air purifier.Ross' air purifier.

109
00:06:10 --> 00:06:14
All I heard for four yearsthrough college was...

110
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
You should have gone outonce in a while.

111
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
- I hate this thing!- Come on, Chandler.

112
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
Ross is our friend.He needs us right now.

113
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
So why don't you be a grownupand come watch TV in the fort?

114
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
I wanted to invite you to the party.

115
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
Thanks, I'll try to stop by.

116
00:06:33 --> 00:06:36
Actually, I thinkI'm going to be busy.

117
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
You are?

118
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
Remember, I've got that gala?

119
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
What's the gala for?

120
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
It's a regatta gala.

121
00:06:47 --> 00:06:48
Do you sail?

122
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
No, but I support it.

123
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
I hope I see you tomorrow night.Take care.

124
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
Walked right into that one,didn't he?

125
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
What one?

126
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
You wanted him to invite youand he did.

127
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
He waited until the last minute.So if I said yes...

128
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
...he'd know I had nothing betterto do than wait for his invitation.

129
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
But I said no...

130
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
...which puts me backin the driver's seat.

131
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
So the ball is in his court?

132
00:07:15 --> 00:07:15
Ball?

133
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
No, there's no ball.

134
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Joey, please.

135
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
Sorry.

136
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
Hello, children.

137
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
You want to play some foosball?Please?

138
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
We moved the table into my roombecause of all the boxes.

139
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
Come on!

140
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
I have one question.

141
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
What is the deal with this?

142
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?

143
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
No, the quiet down thing.

144
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
You mean this.

145
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
I don't know how much moreI can take.

146
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
Did you know he taped over my "Baywatch"tape with a show about bugs?

147
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
My God!

148
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
What if that had been porn?

149
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
All right, this may be tough...

150
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
...but it's Ross.I survived college with him.

151
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
I guess I can hold outa little longer.

152
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
Let's have a game.

153
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
Fellas?

154
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
So he's out of here.

155
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
Got anything to eat?I went to Jono's and it was closed.

156
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
I took Larry there, but it was allviolated, so we shut it down.

157
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
If this guy keeps closing ourfavorite places, where will we eat?

158
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
I don't know. Clean places?

159
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
Yum!

160
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
It's Danny.

161
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
Don't let him in!I'm supposed to be at a gala.

162
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
We'll be right there.Can't you say it's later?

163
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
What kind of a regatta galastarts at night?

164
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
The fake kind.

165
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
- I need a ladle. You got a ladle?- We have a ladle.

166
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
See you at the party.

167
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
You know what Larry would say?He'd say, "See you ladle."

168
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
I'm done. You want anything?Sports? International?

169
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
Apartment listings?

170
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
I'll take sports.

171
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
Mine!

172
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
All right, international.

173
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
That's mine too.

174
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
I'm Italian.

175
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
I could check apartment listings,though there's never anything here.

176
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
Not even on page seven?

177
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
You're right.Here's an affordable place.

178
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
Two bedroom, close to work.It's available in five weeks.

179
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
What about that circled one?

180
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
It's kind of expensive for a studio.

181
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
But it's available now.

182
00:10:11 --> 00:10:11
Isn't it?

183
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
Yes, it is.

184
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
Let's go look at it!

185
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
There we go!

186
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
Guys, would you chip in for somenew air filters for the purifier?

187
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
I mean, after all,we are all using it.

188
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
Let's go quicker!

189
00:10:38 --> 00:10:39
Oh, my God!

190
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
Look at this kitchen/bathroom.

191
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
That's great!So you can cook while in the tub.

192
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
Somebody was using his head.

193
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
Let's check outthe rest of the place.

194
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
I think this is it.

195
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
I don't know.Maybe we should keep looking.

196
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
But this place is available now.

197
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
You don't want to be stuckwith us for five weeks.

198
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
So you think I shouldtake this place?

199
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
It's perfect!

200
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
How about you?

201
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.

202
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
I see what you guys are saying.

203
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
I'll go downstairsand fill out an application.

204
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
We are bad people.

205
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
He knew we were tryingto get rid of him.

206
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
Could we get a bathtubin our kitchen?

207
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
Ready for dinner?

208
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
- Absolutely.- Great.

209
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
You wanted to go tothe Italian place on Bleecker St.?

210
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
I love that place!

211
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
So, no.

212
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
How about Mama Lozetti's?

213
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
Sure.

214
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
How long has that milkbeen sitting out?

215
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
No, this place is totally healthy.

216
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
This milk is mine.I bought this today...

217
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
...because I was thirsty for milk,you know?

218
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
Okay, let's go.

219
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
Hey, buddy.

220
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
Health Code 11 B requires that refusebe taken out the back exit.

221
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
But then I have to goall the way around.

222
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
So you choose convenienceover health?

223
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
Stop, Larry.

224
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
Can't you just be Larry and notLarry the health inspector guy?

225
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
It was exciting at first.

226
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
But now, it's like, so whereare we going to eat ever?

227
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
I suppose I could give him a warning.

228
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
Thank you.

229
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
Go, go!

230
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
If, after dinner,you still need to bust someone...

231
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
...I know a hot dog vendorwho picks his nose.

232
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
Maybe we did good,helping Ross get back on his feet.

233
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
That was a nice place.

234
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
No closet space, but he could hanghis stuff out the window in a bag.

235
00:13:08 --> 00:13:09
What do we do?

236
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
I don't know.

237
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
Maybe pizza?

238
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
About Ross!

239
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
It's the apartment manager.Ross put us as references.

240
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
Ross is the greatest guy.He's very reliable...

241
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
Of course, he has a big, huge dogthat barks into the night.

242
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
Well, who doesn't love dogs?

243
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
He's a tap dancer.

244
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
Yes, some would saythat is a lost art.

245
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
He's a pimp!

246
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
There you go. He's a pimp.

247
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!

248
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
This is never going to work.He's right there.

249
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
Just go say hi.

250
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16
I have to go downstairs and back up,as if I'm coming home from the gala.

251
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
So just go distract him.But don't be sexy.

252
00:14:22 --> 00:14:22
What's going on?

253
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
This is a great party.Great food.

254
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
You know, most parties, it's allchips and salsa, chips and salsa.

255
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
So...

256
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
What's this?

257
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
Salad.

258
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
And what's this?

259
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
Bread.

260
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
Aren't you a chef?

261
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
Right, tonight was your party.

262
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
You look great!I'm glad you made it.

263
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
Well, you know,the gala had to end sometime.

264
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
Don't go anywhere.I'll be right back.

265
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
Whose court is the ball in now?

266
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
I thought there wasn't a ball.

267
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
Come on. He's glad I came.He doesn't want me to go anywhere.

268
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
Ball's flying all over the place.

269
00:15:11 --> 00:15:12
This is my friend, Tom.

270
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
This is the girl I told you about.

271
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
Come on!You telling people about me?

272
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
I think you twocould really hit it off.

273
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
I'm gonna to go mingle.

274
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27

275
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
At ease, soldier!

276
00:15:35 --> 00:15:35
I'm sorry?

277
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
You can just drop the act.I know what's going on.

278
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
You're Danny's wingman, right?

279
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
You guys are best buds, frat bros.

280
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
I'm going to go talk to a friend.

281
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.

282
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Go tell him, "Nice try."

283
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
He just keeps lobbing them up...

284
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
...and I keep knocking themright out of the park.

285
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
I think I need a drink.

286
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
Ninety-eight...

287
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
...ninety-nine...

288
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
...one hundred!

289
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
Okay. Go.

290
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

291
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
Here we go, here we go.

292
00:16:20 --> 00:16:24
So I didn't get that apartment.Some problem with my application.

293
00:16:24 --> 00:16:25
You're kidding?

294
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
But Phoebe said I could stayat her place for a while, so...

295
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.We're roomies.

296
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
You don't need metaking up all your space.

297
00:16:34 --> 00:16:39
We got plenty of space.There's still some by that speaker.

298
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
Please, just stay.

299
00:16:41 --> 00:16:42
Are you sure?

300
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
- Definitely.- You have to stay.

301
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
So I'm a pimp, huh?

302
00:16:53 --> 00:16:54
It's okay.

303
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.

304
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
But just talk to me.Tell me if something bothers you.

305
00:16:59 --> 00:17:05
And I'll do everything I canto keep my annoying habits just...

306
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
Well, I see you've hada very productive day.

307
00:17:20 --> 00:17:21
The cowboy hat's a little much.

308
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
Come on, it's fun!

309
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
All right.

310
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
Isn't this a woman's hat?

311
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
Dude, stop talking crazy,and make us some tea!
