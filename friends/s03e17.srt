16

00:00:05.03,00:00:06.62

17

Can I see the comics?

18



19

00:00:07.11,00:00:08.67

20

This is the New York Times.

21



22

00:00:09.79,00:00:11.86

23

Okay, may I see the comics?

24



25

00:00:13.43,00:00:15.87

26

I thought you were[br]taking Ross to the game.

27



28

00:00:16.07,00:00:19.22

29

-We are. He's meeting us here.[br]-No, Rachel's meeting us here!

30



31

00:00:19.43,00:00:21.18

32

Come on![br]They can be in the same room.

33



34

00:00:21.43,00:00:24.23

35

-You should've been there last night.[br]-What happened?

36



37

00:00:24.43,00:00:26.02

38

Ross was hanging out at our place.

39



40

00:00:26.27,00:00:29.58

41

Rachel comes over to borrow[br]some moisturizer from Chandler--

42



43

00:00:30.83,00:00:32.42

44

How hard is it to say "something"?

45



46

00:00:32.67,00:00:35.79

47

Rachel came over to borrow "something. "

48



49

00:00:37.07,00:00:40.30

50

Anyway, her and Ross just started[br]yelling at each other.

51



52

00:00:40.51,00:00:43.82

53

Why was he yelling at her?[br]He slept with someone else.

54



55

00:00:44.03,00:00:46.23

56

He says they were on a break[br]when it happened. . .

57



58

00:00:46.43,00:00:48.18

59

. . .so she should've[br]forgiven him by now.

60



61

00:00:48.43,00:00:51.31

62

He is so unreasonable! God!

63



64

00:00:51.55,00:00:53.54

65

Although I understand what he means.

66



67

00:00:54.83,00:00:57.30

68

Oh, my God![br]This is like 60 Minutes...

69



70

00:00:57.51,00:01:01.19

71

. . .when at first you're mad that[br]pharmaceutical company made the drug.

72



73

00:01:01.39,00:01:04.19

74

And then, you just feel bad[br]for the people, because. . .

75



76

00:01:04.39,00:01:06.86

77

. . .they needed[br]to make their hair grow.

78



79

00:01:07.27,00:01:10.58

80

You know, this is like[br]when my parents got divorced.

81



82

00:01:11.07,00:01:13.83

83

I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me[br]after Cub Scouts.

84



85

00:01:15.87,00:01:19.63

86

I dreamed that Ross and Rachel[br]were still together.

87



88

00:01:19.87,00:01:21.70

89

And we were all[br]hanging out and happy.

90



91

00:01:21.95,00:01:23.07

92

I had the same dream.

93



94

00:01:23.27,00:01:27.79

95

-And nobody slept with the xerox girl.[br]-Oh, I had the opposite dream.

96



97

00:01:28.87,00:01:31.78

98

Maybe it's gonna be okay.[br]I mean, it's been a week.

99



100

00:01:31.99,00:01:34.55

101

It never takes me more than a week[br]to get over a relationship.

102



103

00:01:34.75,00:01:37.74

104

It never takes you more than a shower[br]to get over a relationship.

105



106

00:01:40.63,00:01:43.99

107

Let's go! Let's hit the road.[br]Let's get the show on it.

108



109

00:01:44.23,00:01:45.11

110

Let me get coffee.

111



112

00:01:45.35,00:01:47.34

113

I know the best coffeehouse.[br]And it's close.

114



115

00:01:47.99,00:01:48.98

116

Closer than here?

117



118

00:01:49.75,00:01:51.82

119

Oh, look! I found coffee!

120



121

00:01:52.07,00:01:53.39

122

Okay, let's skedaddle.

123



124

00:01:53.59,00:01:55.98

125

I'm not gonna drink[br]somebody's old coffee.

126



127

00:01:56.19,00:01:57.75

128

Okay, Your Highness.

129



130

00:02:05.19,00:02:09.39

131

"Rachel, I'm really sorry. "[br]"Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"

132



133

00:02:09.59,00:02:10.47

134

"Yeah, okay. "

135



136

00:02:10.87,00:02:12.99

137

Did anyone else hear that?

138



139

00:02:14.99,00:02:17.03

140

147



148

00:03:12.51,00:03:14.23

149

Here's your moisturizer.

150



151

00:03:17.67,00:03:20.58

152

You guys are gonna love me![br]Okay, check it out.

153

00:03:20.79,00:03:22.59

155

158

Calvin Klein lingerie show,[br]and you guys are coming with me.

159



160

00:03:30.15,00:03:32.19

161

I said that out loud, right?

162



163

00:03:32.67,00:03:35.82

164

Yes, it's just that[br]we kind of already. . .

165



166

00:03:36.07,00:03:37.98

167

. . .made plans with Ross.

168



169

00:03:40.87,00:03:42.19

170

Well, okay.

171



172

00:03:42.63,00:03:43.70

173

Well, there you go.

174



175

00:03:43.95,00:03:46.18

176

It's just, he got this new[br]home-theater dealy. . .

177



178

00:03:46.39,00:03:48.22

179

. . .and he wants us to check it out.

180



181

00:03:48.59,00:03:50.03

182

He's excited about it too.

183



184

00:03:50.27,00:03:53.18

185

He even recorded showtimes[br]on his answering machine.

186



187

00:03:53.87,00:03:55.62

188

-We're sorry, honey.[br]-Oh, it's okay.

189



190

00:03:55.87,00:03:59.18

191

Rach, it's not that[br]we don't want to. Really.

192



193

00:03:59.43,00:04:02.66

194

Are we talking models[br]in their underwear?

195



196

00:04:03.51,00:04:04.31

197

And heels.

198



199

00:04:08.23,00:04:11.19

200

Ross did ask us first,[br]and we set that night aside.

201



202

00:04:11.43,00:04:14.63

203

Come on. If he asked you first,[br]it's only fair.

204



205

00:04:17.75,00:04:20.39

206

Oh, boy, do I feel bad!

207



208

00:04:21.11,00:04:22.18

209

very bad.

210



211

00:04:22.43,00:04:24.15

212

Chandler, what are you doing?

213



214

00:04:25.43,00:04:26.79

215

Oh, my God!

216



217

00:04:27.75,00:04:28.98

218

You're smoking again?

219



220

00:04:29.23,00:04:31.79

221

Well, actually,[br]yesterday, I was smoking again.

222



223

00:04:32.03,00:04:33.26

224

Today I'm smoking, still.

225



226

00:04:34.31,00:04:37.83

227

Why would you start again[br]after chewing all that quitting gum?

228



229

00:04:38.03,00:04:40.63

230

This is just like[br]my parents' divorce. . .

231



232

00:04:40.83,00:04:43.03

233

. . .which is when[br]I first started smoking.

234



235

00:04:44.15,00:04:45.63

236

Weren't you 9?

237



238

00:04:51.07,00:04:54.78

239

I'm telling you something,[br]that first smoke after naptime. . . .

240



241

00:04:56.99,00:04:58.98

242

That's great.[br]With my luck, that's him.

243



244

00:04:59.23,00:05:00.55

245

Him? Ross?

246



247

00:05:00.75,00:05:04.27

248

No, "Hymn" 253:[br]"His Eyes Are on the Sparrow. "

249



250

00:05:06.19,00:05:10.39

251

When my parents got divorced, I started[br]using humor as a defense mechanism.

252



253

00:05:13.27,00:05:15.87

254

Hi. Do you guys have weekend plans?

255



256

00:05:16.07,00:05:20.99

257

Because my sister says we can spend[br]the weekend at her cabin, skiing.

258



259

00:05:22.07,00:05:25.43

260

I'm asking you first, right?[br]I'm playing by the rules.

261



262

00:05:25.67,00:05:26.79

263

Absolutely.

264



265

00:05:26.99,00:05:29.83

266

Chandler! You're smoking?[br]What are you doing?

267



268

00:05:30.07,00:05:32.22

269

Shut up![br]You're not my real mom!

270



271

00:05:38.47,00:05:42.18

272

Could you close that window?[br]My nipples could cut glass!

273



274

00:05:45.27,00:05:47.74

275

Really? Because mine[br]get me out of tickets.

276



277

00:05:50.35,00:05:55.19

278

Look, I just wanna say I really[br]appreciate you spending time with me.

279



280

00:05:55.39,00:05:59.35

281

It's been a hard time right now,[br]so I just want to say thanks.

282



283

00:05:59.55,00:06:02.59

284

Somebody else hug him.[br]I have to stay by the window.

285



286

00:06:06.07,00:06:09.62

287

How about this weekend, we have[br]a laser-disc marathon, okay?

288



289

00:06:09.87,00:06:12.78

290

And maybe a tournament[br]on my new: : :

291



292

00:06:13.87,00:06:16.26

293

. . .dart board! What do you think?

294



295

00:06:16.47,00:06:18.78

296

Two days of darts! It'll be great!

297



298

00:06:20.67,00:06:22.03

299

It'll be great for next weekend.

300



301

00:06:22.23,00:06:23.82

302

This weekend, guys.

303



304

00:06:24.03,00:06:26.02

305

It'll be great for next weekend.

306



307

00:06:26.27,00:06:28.79

308

I mean, "It'll be great. "

309



310

00:06:31.87,00:06:32.78

311

What's going on?

312



313

00:06:33.03,00:06:37.82

314

We're sort of invited to go skiing.[br]You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?

315



316

00:06:41.27,00:06:43.79

317

So, for the whole weekend?

318



319

00:06:44.27,00:06:47.55

320

We're really sorry,[br]but she did ask us first.

321



322

00:06:49.39,00:06:51.83

323

That's okay. If you[br]all have to go away. . .

324



325

00:06:52.03,00:06:54.79

326

. . .for the first weekend I'm[br]alone by myself. . .

327



328

00:06:54.99,00:06:56.74

329

. . .then I totally understand.

330



331

00:06:57.63,00:06:59.43

332

I can stay. I'm gonna stay.

333



334

00:06:59.67,00:07:02.98

335

The last time I went,[br]I was afraid to leave the chair lift.

336



337

00:07:03.19,00:07:04.78

338

I just went round and round.

339



340

00:07:05.99,00:07:09.11

341

We need you to drive us there[br]in your grandmother's cab.

342



343

00:07:09.31,00:07:13.83

344

-But you know what? I'll stay.[br]-No, I'll stay. He's my brother.

345



346

00:07:14.03,00:07:15.99

347

What, a "pity stay"?

348



349

00:07:16.87,00:07:18.99

350

We're gonna have fun!

351



352

00:07:19.23,00:07:21.22

353

We can make fudge.

354



355

00:07:23.39,00:07:24.62

356

Pity food?

357



358

00:07:25.67,00:07:28.39

359

You know what?[br]I don't need any of you to stay.

360



361

00:07:28.59,00:07:29.95

362

Nobody stays.

363



364

00:07:30.23,00:07:32.67

365

Well, then, I might as well[br]offer to stay.

366



367

00:07:40.87,00:07:43.10

368

Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?

369



370

00:07:43.35,00:07:44.50

371

You think he's still mad?

372



373

00:07:44.71,00:07:48.75

374

He's probably more mad since[br]you called him to borrow his goggles.

375



376

00:07:48.95,00:07:50.51

377

What? Mine aren't tinted.

378



379

00:07:55.07,00:07:55.98

380

What?

381



382

00:07:56.23,00:07:58.19

383

What does the sign say?

384



385

00:07:59.63,00:08:01.78

386

"Beam me up, Jesus. "

387



388

00:08:02.59,00:08:03.99

389

The "No Smoking" sign.

390



391

00:08:04.23,00:08:06.79

392

There's no smoking[br]in my grandmother's cab.

393



394

00:08:07.47,00:08:10.19

395

Well, then, I have to go[br]to the bathroom.

396



397

00:08:10.51,00:08:11.99

398

Oh, please!

399



400

00:08:12.19,00:08:14.99

401

No unscheduled stops.[br]You can go when we stop for gas.

402



403

00:08:15.19,00:08:19.63

404

There's a rest stop right up there.[br]Come on, I really have to go!

405



406

00:08:22.03,00:08:23.59

407

Oh, now I have to go!

408



409

00:08:31.43,00:08:32.63

410

Here we go.

411



412

00:08:32.83,00:08:34.39

413

-Brace yourself![br]-What?

414



415

00:08:43.67,00:08:45.55

416

-Aren't you gonna go?[br]-No, thanks.

417



418

00:08:45.75,00:08:48.35

419

Rachel never pees in public restrooms.

420



421

00:08:49.07,00:08:50.98

422

They never have any paper in there.

423



424

00:08:51.23,00:08:53.95

425

So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy. "

426



427

00:09:00.15,00:09:02.38

428

Well, if everybody's going. . . .

429



430

00:09:03.47,00:09:05.75

431

Don't close it![br]The keys are in there!

432



433

00:09:07.83,00:09:10.22

434

-What's going on?[br]-My lighter's in there!

435



436

00:09:16.99,00:09:19.87

437

Damn! The tailpipe's[br]not hot enough to light this.

438



439

00:09:21.59,00:09:24.19

440

I can open this.[br]Anybody got a coat hanger?

441



442

00:09:24.43,00:09:25.23

443

Oh, I do.

444



445

00:09:25.43,00:09:28.82

446

No, I took it out of my shirt[br]when I put it on this morning.

447



448

00:09:30.67,00:09:32.42

449

So if your parents hadn't divorced. . .

450



451

00:09:32.63,00:09:35.78

452

. . .you'd be able to answer a question[br]like a normal person?

453



454

00:09:37.47,00:09:40.83

455

Look, I just need a wire something[br]to jimmy it.

456



457

00:09:41.03,00:09:43.02

458

One of you give me[br]your bra underwire.

459



460

00:09:45.23,00:09:47.59

461

Come on![br]Who has the biggest boobs?

462



463

00:09:49.07,00:09:52.51

464

Whoever has the biggest boobs,[br]has the biggest bra and wire.

465



466

00:09:52.95,00:09:54.31

467

-No![br]-It's too expensive!

468



469

00:09:55.15,00:09:57.83

470

To get back in the car,[br]we need that wire.

471



472

00:09:58.07,00:09:59.22

473

Your call.

474



475

00:10:02.87,00:10:04.19

476

Monica's are the biggest.

477



478

00:10:06.47,00:10:10.59

479

These tiny little non-breasts?[br]Please! It's gotta be Rachel.

480



481

00:10:11.83,00:10:13.63

482

No, mine are deceptively small.

483



484

00:10:13.87,00:10:17.47

485

I mean, I actually sometimes[br]stuff my bra.

486



487

00:10:18.47,00:10:21.38

488

Well, then, your bra would[br]still be big.

489



490

00:10:21.59,00:10:23.95

491

No, I stuff outside the bra.

492



493

00:10:24.91,00:10:27.11

494

Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?

495



496

00:10:27.35,00:10:29.58

497

Phoebe, Rachel,[br]take off Monica's bra.

498



499

00:10:30.71,00:10:32.38

500

All right, forget it, never mind.

501



502

00:10:32.63,00:10:34.43

503

-You can have mine.[br]-Thank you.

504



505

00:10:37.27,00:10:40.18

506

What are you doing?[br]There's a trash can right there.

507



508

00:10:40.83,00:10:44.79

509

I thought if I littered, that crying[br]lndian might come by and save us.

510



511

00:10:47.83,00:10:48.63

512

There.

513



514

00:10:49.47,00:10:52.43

515

Thank you, Phoebe.[br]That's very, very generous.

516



517

00:10:53.27,00:10:55.39

518

Now, let's decide[br]who has the nicest ass.

519



520

00:10:58.35,00:10:59.47

521

And there you go!

522



523

00:11:05.47,00:11:08.38

524

Well, at least let me smoke it[br]to the good part!

525



526

00:11:20.59,00:11:22.23

527

-What's going on?[br]-What?

528



529

00:11:22.47,00:11:24.78

530

Yeah, this has happened before.

531



532

00:11:25.07,00:11:28.78

533

-So you know how to fix it?[br]-Yep. Put more gas in.

534



535

00:11:37.23,00:11:39.19

536

Hi. What are you doing here?

537



538

00:11:39.43,00:11:41.63

539

I was wondering,[br]when you and I split up. . .

540



541

00:11:41.87,00:11:45.79

542

. . .did you get the tape that was[br]half the last episode of M.A. S.H...

543



544

00:11:45.99,00:11:48.11

545

. . .and half the hostages coming home?

546



547

00:11:49.47,00:11:52.99

548

But now it's Susan and me in Mexico[br]and the hostages coming home.

549



550

00:11:53.63,00:11:54.43

551

Where's Ben?

552



553

00:11:54.63,00:11:55.83

554

He's sleeping.

555



556

00:11:57.95,00:11:59.78

557

Is this a bad time?

558



559

00:12:00.03,00:12:02.71

560

Yeah, actually.[br]Susan's gonna be here any minute.

561



562

00:12:02.91,00:12:04.50

563

It's kind of an anniversary.

564



565

00:12:05.15,00:12:07.51

566

I thought you guys[br]got married in January.

567



568

00:12:07.71,00:12:09.35

569

A different kind of anniversary.

570



571

00:12:13.99,00:12:15.63

572

So anyway--

573



574

00:12:15.87,00:12:17.70

575

Candles, champagne. . . .

576



577

00:12:18.07,00:12:20.38

578

Yeah, anniversaries are great. . .

579



580

00:12:20.87,00:12:23.26

581

. . .because love lasts forever,[br]you know?

582



583

00:12:24.07,00:12:27.19

584

There's nothing like it[br]in this life. Money in the bank.

585



586

00:12:27.43,00:12:29.10

587

So Rachel and I broke up.

588



589

00:12:30.59,00:12:33.03

590

God, Ross, I am so sorry!

591



592

00:12:34.47,00:12:35.43

593

You know what?

594



595

00:12:35.67,00:12:37.63

596

I wanna talk about this so much. . .

597



598

00:12:37.83,00:12:40.03

599

. . .but when we can really get into it.

600



601

00:12:40.27,00:12:42.42

602

-You free for dinner tomorrow?[br]-I'd love that.

603



604

00:12:42.63,00:12:43.54

605

Me too.

606



607

00:12:43.75,00:12:47.22

608

I guess it all started[br]when Rachel got this new job.

609



610

00:12:49.63,00:12:51.43

611

Triple A can pick us up.

612



613

00:12:51.67,00:12:53.50

614

What town are we near?

615



616

00:12:53.75,00:12:54.55

617

Freemont.

618



619

00:12:54.75,00:12:56.07

620

Westmont.

621



622

00:12:56.55,00:12:57.35

623

Westberg?

624



625

00:12:57.55,00:12:59.38

626

Why are you answering?

627



628

00:13:00.55,00:13:02.19

629

Do you know[br]what route we're on?

630



631

00:13:02.43,00:13:05.31

632

We are definitely on Route 27.

633



634

00:13:05.51,00:13:08.39

635

We are at a rest stop on Route 27--

636



637

00:13:08.59,00:13:10.26

638

There is no Route 27.

639



640

00:13:10.47,00:13:12.91

641

-Either 93 or 76.[br]-I don't know.

642



643

00:13:13.11,00:13:15.55

644

I always slept in the back[br]when we drove here.

645



646

00:13:16.67,00:13:21.22

647

Can you just send someone up and down[br]76 and check every rest stop?

648



649

00:13:21.47,00:13:23.19

650

And also 93?

651



652

00:13:25.87,00:13:27.10

653

No, they don't do that.

654



655

00:13:30.63,00:13:32.38

656

Somebody will come and save us.

657



658

00:13:32.63,00:13:35.83

659

Who? Have you seen a car[br]in the last hour and a half?

660



661

00:13:36.07,00:13:39.03

662

We should call Ross.[br]Maybe he can get a car to get us.

663



664

00:13:39.27,00:13:41.42

665

I am not getting in a car with Ross!

666



667

00:13:41.67,00:13:43.39

668

We will just have to. . .

669



670

00:13:43.59,00:13:44.42

671

. . .Iive here!

672



673

00:13:45.83,00:13:47.31

674

-But it's so cold.[br]-No!

675



676

00:13:47.51,00:13:50.82

677

I won't get in a car with him.[br]Think of something else.

678



679

00:13:51.07,00:13:52.51

680

Joey and Chandler are back!

681



682

00:13:55.59,00:13:57.82

683

So the "going for help" went well?

684



685

00:13:58.27,00:14:01.98

686

Smokey Joe here got halfway[br]to the highway and collapsed.

687



688

00:14:02.19,00:14:04.39

689

I have the lung capacity[br]of a 2-year-old.

690



691

00:14:05.03,00:14:06.43

692

Then why are you smoking?

693



694

00:14:06.63,00:14:07.95

695

It's very unsettling.

696



697

00:14:11.35,00:14:13.79

698

Right? I mean,[br]it's pretty unbelievable.

699



700

00:14:14.03,00:14:17.47

701

They just took off,[br]without even looking back.

702



703

00:14:18.27,00:14:21.50

704

I don't need them.[br]I've got you guys now as friends.

705



706

00:14:21.75,00:14:22.79

707

You and Susan.

708



709

00:14:23.43,00:14:25.58

710

Susan will be so pleased.

711



712

00:14:27.63,00:14:29.15

713

Seven-one-seven?

714



715

00:14:29.35,00:14:30.79

716

Where's 71 7?

717



718

00:14:33.43,00:14:35.42

719

You have more of these[br]for Susan, right?

720



721

00:14:35.67,00:14:37.07

722

No, but that's okay.

723



724

00:14:37.27,00:14:39.79

725

I'll just put out pickles[br]or something.

726



727

00:14:43.83,00:14:45.63

728

-Ross, thank God![br]-Pheebs?

729



730

00:14:45.83,00:14:47.27

731

Why are you whispering?

732



733

00:14:47.79,00:14:49.62

734

I ate a bug.

735



736

00:14:50.75,00:14:53.39

737

Hey, Rach! The tampons here[br]are only a penny.

738



739

00:14:53.59,00:14:55.18

740

Let's stock up.

741



742

00:14:56.23,00:15:00.35

743

We're out of gas and don't know where[br]we are so we can't get a tow truck.

744



745

00:15:01.47,00:15:03.14

746

Now you want a favor?

747



748

00:15:03.35,00:15:04.15

749

Yes, please.

750



751

00:15:04.35,00:15:06.79

752

I'm sorry your[br]car broke down, Pheebs. . .

753



754

00:15:07.03,00:15:10.10

755

. . .but I'm too busy with some of[br]my real friends right now.

756



757

00:15:10.31,00:15:12.99

758

But please call to let me know[br]you got home safely.

759



760

00:15:13.23,00:15:14.98

761

Phoebe, hang on a second.

762



763

00:15:15.27,00:15:16.86

764

Take my car.[br]Get your friends.

765



766

00:15:17.07,00:15:18.63

767

No, I won't pick them up.

768



769

00:15:18.87,00:15:21.71

770

We both know you'll do it,[br]because you're not a jerk.

771



772

00:15:21.95,00:15:24.79

773

So you can sulk here for half an hour,[br]then go get them. . .

774



775

00:15:25.03,00:15:27.83

776

-. . .or save time and sulk in the car.[br]-Rachel doesn't--

777



778

00:15:28.07,00:15:30.14

779

I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark. . .

780



781

00:15:30.35,00:15:32.79

782

. . .and you're the innocent victim[br]in this.

783



784

00:15:33.03,00:15:35.71

785

But don't punish your friends[br]for what Rachel did.

786



787

00:15:37.99,00:15:39.19

788

Yeah, you're right.

789



790

00:15:39.79,00:15:42.39

791

Phoebe, hang on.[br]Ross wants to say something.

792



793

00:15:42.59,00:15:43.39

794

What?

795



796

00:15:43.67,00:15:45.19

797

You slept with someone else?

798



799

00:15:47.03,00:15:48.67

800

We were on a break!

801



802

00:15:50.07,00:15:51.06

803

We were--

804



805

00:15:52.19,00:15:55.18

806

Where are you? I'll find you.

807



808

00:15:55.43,00:15:56.83

809

You slept with another woman?

810



811

00:15:57.03,00:15:59.55

812

Oh, you're one to talk.

813



814

00:16:03.87,00:16:05.39

815

Okay, done!

816



817

00:16:07.67,00:16:08.55

818

What's "pleh"?

819



820

00:16:09.67,00:16:11.79

821

That's "help" spelled backwards. . .

822



823

00:16:11.99,00:16:14.98

824

. . .so that the helicopters can read it[br]from the air.

825



826

00:16:17.07,00:16:19.38

827

What's "dufus" spelled backwards?

828



829

00:16:21.99,00:16:22.90

830

Car! Car!

831



832

00:16:26.47,00:16:28.94

833

Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!

834



835

00:16:30.75,00:16:32.55

836

What is he doing here?

837



838

00:16:32.75,00:16:34.58

839

He is saving your butt.

840



841

00:16:34.83,00:16:36.87

842

Unless I'm stepping on[br]some toes here. . .

843



844

00:16:37.07,00:16:38.82

845

. . .in which case[br]I could just mosey on.

846



847

00:16:39.07,00:16:41.43

848

I have plenty of people to help[br]on the interstate.

849



850

00:16:41.63,00:16:43.91

851

-Come on![br]-We need your help, please!

852



853

00:16:44.11,00:16:45.99

854

Fine! Fine!

855



856

00:16:49.79,00:16:53.18

857

Oh, no! Now it's[br]not gonna make any sense.

858



859

00:16:54.83,00:16:56.03

860

You guys. . .

861



862

00:16:56.55,00:16:59.39

863

. . .what do we do about Ross?[br]He drove all the way up here.

864



865

00:16:59.63,00:17:01.78

866

Just send him back,[br]then we'll go skiing?

867



868

00:17:02.03,00:17:04.79

869

This is horrible.[br]It's just horrible.

870



871

00:17:05.39,00:17:07.46

872

Should we ask Ross to come along?

873



874

00:17:07.67,00:17:10.63

875

But what about Rachel?[br]How are we gonna even ask her?

876



877

00:17:10.87,00:17:12.39

878

Ask me what?

879



880

00:17:15.03,00:17:17.75

881

If it might be okay if[br]Ross came skiing?

882



883

00:17:18.27,00:17:20.58

884

No, I wasn't gonna ask that.

885



886

00:17:22.59,00:17:25.50

887

You guys are unbelievable.[br]No, he cannot come!

888



889

00:17:25.75,00:17:27.79

890

-Excuse me?[br]-It's horrible!

891



892

00:17:28.35,00:17:33.03

893

Oh, please? Can't I come[br]to your special, magical cabin?

894



895

00:17:33.27,00:17:36.79

896

Why would you even want to come?[br]You're a horrible skier.

897



898

00:17:37.03,00:17:39.71

899

Hitting me where it hurts![br]My ski skills!

900



901

00:17:40.75,00:17:41.82

902

Here we go again.

903



904

00:17:42.03,00:17:43.59

905

I can't handle this, you guys.

906



907

00:17:43.79,00:17:45.91

908

I can handle it.[br]"Handle" is my middle name.

909



910

00:17:46.15,00:17:49.59

911

Actually, it's the middle part[br]of my first name.

912



913

00:17:51.15,00:17:53.22

914

All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.

915



916

00:17:53.43,00:17:54.39

917

Let's go.

918



919

00:17:55.23,00:17:56.03

920

You're welcome.

921



922

00:17:56.27,00:17:59.79

923

I'm sorry. Were you speaking to me,[br]or sleeping with someone else?

924



925

00:18:01.07,00:18:02.27

926

We were on a break!

927



928

00:18:02.47,00:18:05.91

929

Why don't you just put that[br]on your answering machine?

930



931

00:18:06.11,00:18:08.79

932

It's valid, and I'm not the only one[br]who thinks so.

933



934

00:18:08.99,00:18:10.14

935

Monica agrees with me.

936



937

00:18:10.87,00:18:11.86

938

What?

939



940

00:18:12.79,00:18:14.07

941

I don't know.

942



943

00:18:15.35,00:18:16.67

944

You said it last night.

945



946

00:18:17.03,00:18:20.18

947

What I said[br]was that I understood.

948



949

00:18:20.39,00:18:23.07

950

Joey is the one who agreed with you.

951



952

00:18:23.67,00:18:24.90

953

Really, Joey?

954



955

00:18:26.43,00:18:27.39

956

What?

957



958

00:18:28.47,00:18:31.43

959

You know what?[br]There is no right or wrong here.

960



961

00:18:31.63,00:18:34.02

962

I think it's very obvious[br]who's wrong here.

963



964

00:18:34.23,00:18:36.19

965

Obviously not to Joey.

966



967

00:18:38.79,00:18:39.78

968

What?

969



970

00:18:40.59,00:18:44.67

971

-Joey and Monica feel the way I do![br]-You and this innocent puppy act!

972



973

00:18:45.51,00:18:47.58

974

Hey, guess who I am?

975



976

00:18:57.47,00:18:59.78

977

Look what you're doing to Chandler!

978



979

00:19:03.07,00:19:06.78

980

Look. We know that this is[br]really, really hard for you guys.

981



982

00:19:07.75,00:19:09.66

983

You don't have to love each other.

984



985

00:19:09.87,00:19:13.39

986

You don't even have to like[br]each other much right now.

987



988

00:19:13.59,00:19:16.31

989

But please, find a way[br]to be around each other.

990



991

00:19:16.51,00:19:19.03

992

And not put us in the middle.

993



994

00:19:19.23,00:19:24.02

995

Otherwise, I mean, that's just it[br]for us hanging out together.

996



997

00:19:24.27,00:19:26.18

998

Is that what you want?

999



1000

00:19:28.03,00:19:29.59

1001

Can you be civil?

1002



1003

00:19:32.67,00:19:33.79

1004

I can.

1005



1006

00:19:35.11,00:19:37.79

1007

Good, let's get back in the car.[br]It's freezing. . .

1008



1009

00:19:38.03,00:19:39.75

1010

. . .and my chest is unsupported.

1011



1012

00:19:40.75,00:19:41.82

1013

Wait a second!

1014



1015

00:19:42.07,00:19:44.75

1016

I mean, what are we doing?[br]Who's going with who?

1017



1018

00:19:48.63,00:19:51.23

1019

Look, you guys should go.

1020



1021

00:19:52.27,00:19:54.58

1022

You know,[br]you planned this all out. . .

1023



1024

00:19:56.23,00:19:58.62

1025

. . .and I don't wanna ruin it.[br]So just go.

1026



1027

00:19:58.87,00:20:00.83

1028

You drove all the way up here.

1029



1030

00:20:01.07,00:20:03.22

1031

I've got to take[br]the car back anyway.

1032



1033

00:20:03.47,00:20:05.59

1034

I'm spending all day[br]tomorrow with Ben.

1035



1036

00:20:05.79,00:20:09.79

1037

It's fine, okay? Just go.[br]No guilt, I promise.

1038



1039

00:20:11.79,00:20:12.59

1040

Thank you.

1041



1042

00:20:15.11,00:20:16.63

1043

We'll call you when we get back.

1044



1045

00:20:17.27,00:20:20.34

1046

Maybe we can, like,[br]go to a movie or something.

1047



1048

00:20:20.55,00:20:21.99

1049

Or the rodeo!

1050



1051

00:20:23.87,00:20:24.99

1052

That would be great.

1053



1054

00:20:26.91,00:20:29.95

1055

I was being Shelley Winters[br]from The Poseidon Adventure.

1056



1057

00:20:32.11,00:20:32.91

1058

I know.

1059



1060

00:20:41.15,00:20:42.22

1061

Bye!

1062



1063

00:21:06.47,00:21:07.99

1064

Hi. Sorry I'm late.

1065



1066

00:21:08.35,00:21:09.42

1067

Were you sleeping?

1068



1069

00:21:10.67,00:21:12.07

1070

Oh, great.

1071



1072

00:21:13.19,00:21:16.34

1073

I had to get you a new battery.[br]I got the best I could.

1074



1075

00:21:16.55,00:21:18.30

1076

You don't want to skimp there.

1077



1078

00:21:18.51,00:21:19.58

1079

You're a genius.

1080



1081

00:21:19.83,00:21:21.23

1082

It came to about $1 1 2.

1083



1084

00:21:21.47,00:21:23.75

1085

But what the hell,[br]call it an even 1 1 0?

1086



1087

00:21:25.11,00:21:27.07

1088

I'll pay you tomorrow. Bye!

1089



1090

00:21:27.27,00:21:29.63

1091

So they all took off.

1092



1093

00:21:29.87,00:21:32.83

1094

It was pretty hard[br]watching them go, you know?

1095



1096

00:21:33.07,00:21:34.59

1097

Yeah, okay.[br]Bye.

1098



1099

00:21:38.47,00:21:40.62

1100

So I'm gonna take off then.

1101
