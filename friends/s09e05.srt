1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
Oh, hey, you guys?

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
I couldn't get a reservationfor the night of my birthday...

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
...so we'll have to do dinnerThursday night.

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
- Thursday? But that's Halloween.- So?

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
It's just spooky, that's all.

6
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
So is Mike coming to dinner?

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
No. It's my first birthdaywith a boyfriend, and he has to work.

8
00:00:19 --> 00:00:22
I'd get mad at him, but I thinkit's too soon to show my true colors.

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
I would make the reservation for five.One of us has to stay with Emma.

10
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
- Which one of us should go to dinner?- Rachel!

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
Actually, I was thinkingmaybe both of us could go.

12
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thoughtinto your gift.

13
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
All right, so great, we can all go now.

14
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
That is fun! Hey! You know what?

15
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
We all haven't been together,the six of us, in such a long time.

16
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
What are you talking about?We're together now.

17
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
Mon? Chandler's not here.

18
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
Oh, dear God.

22
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
Hello. It's nice to seeour team together for the first time.

23
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
Now, before we get started,are there any questions?

24
00:01:31 --> 00:01:33
- Yes. Ken, is it?- That's right.

25
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa is,you fell asleep in a meeting...

26
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
...and took the job without realizingwhat you were saying yes to?

27
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
Well, don't believeeverything you hear, Ken.

28
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
But yeah, that's true.

29
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
All right, let's get started by takinga look at last quarter's figures.

30
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
Claudia, aren't you supposedto blow smoke up the boss's ass?

31
00:01:54 --> 00:01:59
- I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?- No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.

32
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
Right now, I can't remember why.

33
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
You're not allowed to smokein this office, right?

34
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smokein offices with 15 people or less.

35
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
- Would you like one?- All right, look. I don't smoke anymore.

36
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
But if the rest of you want to light up,go ahead, it's fine.

37
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
So you all smoke, then?

38
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
You know, it's almost rudethat I'm not smoking.

39
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
- That's not true. If you don't want...- Ken, please!

40
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
No, I can't. I can't smoke.If I smoke, my wife would kill me.

41
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
I'm sorry, but isn't your wifeback in New York?

42
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
I've always liked you, Ken.

43
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
Trick or treat.

44
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
- Hey.- And "treat" it is.

45
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
Wow. So glad I changed.

46
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
I almost wore my threadbare robethat can't contain my breasts.

47
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
This is not what I'm wearing.I'm ovulating...

48
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
...and Chandler's gonna be home.So I thought we would try before dinner.

49
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Wait, does that...? You guys won'tbe late for my dinner, will you?

50
00:02:59 --> 00:03:00
We haven't seen each otherin over a week.

51
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
We'll probably be the first ones there.

52
00:03:03 --> 00:03:04
Okay. See you there. Happy humping.

53
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
Hey. Well, hey!

54
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
Wow, somebody smoked out here?

55
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
My God, don't people know you'renot allowed to smoke in public spaces?

56
00:03:15 --> 00:03:20
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking's legalin offices with fewer than 15 people.

57
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
Oh, you smoked.

58
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
No. I just happen to know a lot of triviaabout smoking in different states.

59
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
For example, in Hawaii,cigarettes are called "lei-lana-lukus."

60
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
- Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes!- Do you think Monica will smell it?

61
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
Are you kidding? That womanhas the nose of a bloodhound.

62
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.

63
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
Pheebs?

64
00:03:45 --> 00:03:46
I'm gonna go.

65
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
Okay. Something to cover the smell.

66
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Oven cleaner.

67
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Unscented.

68
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
Welcome home.

69
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
I've missed you.

70
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
- You want to join me in the bedroom?- No, thanks, I'm good.

71
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
Okay. So you want to play itthat way, do you?

72
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
Well, you know what, actually,I just got off a plane...

73
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
...so I'm feeling gross.I should take a shower.

74
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
- Come here, you don't need a shower.- All right, the truth is...

75
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
...I soiled myselfduring some turbulence.

76
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
What do I smell? I smell smoke.

77
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
Did you smoke?

78
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Yes. But I just had one.

79
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
Two.

80
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five.

81
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
A pack. Two pack... A carton.

82
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
Three big fat cartons in two days!

83
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
But it's over. I've made a decision,I'm not gonna smoke anymore.

84
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
Well, those are for you.

85
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
All right. Well, we'll just see youwhen you get here. Bye.

86
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
Oh, that was my mom.She's stuck in terrible traffic.

87
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
That is now the third signthat I should not leave Emma.

88
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
- What are the other two?- Well, the first one is, I don't want to.

89
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
And second one, I'm not going.

90
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
I know this is the first timewe're leaving the baby.

91
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
I know how hard it is for you. But...

92
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
But everything's gonna be fine.I mean, my mom is gonna be with her.

93
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
- She's great with kids.- She is?

94
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
Yeah.

95
00:05:20 --> 00:05:21
What about Monica?

96
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
You only hear Monica's side of that.Okay, that little fatso was a terror!

97
00:05:27 --> 00:05:31
- I just don't think I can do it.- Know what? You can and you should.

98
00:05:31 --> 00:05:32
Really, it will be good for you.

99
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
In fact, you know what?

100
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
Go ahead to the restaurant,and I will wait for my mom...

101
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
...and then I'll meet you there.No, no, really, you should go. Go out.

102
00:05:39 --> 00:05:44
Really, the world is your oyster.Kick up your heels. Paint the town red!

103
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
- You need to learn some new slang.- I'm serious. Come on, you should go.

104
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
Here. No, just go.

105
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
- Well...- No, no! You know what?

106
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
You're not getting back in there!The baby's fine. Now, scram!

107
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
Yeah, tell your story walking!

108
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
I was just going to saythat I left my keys.

109
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
Holy moley, are we in a pickle now!

110
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
Where is everyone?They're 40 minutes late.

111
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
- I know.- I'm starving.

112
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
I knew we were coming here tonight.I ate nothing all day.

113
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
What about me?I only had one lunch today.

114
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
So are we expectingthe rest of our party shortly?

115
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
Yes, they are expected presently.Yeah.

116
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
Their arrival is in the offing.

117
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
Right. We have a table for two available.

118
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
- Perhaps you'd...- No, they're coming.

119
00:06:32 --> 00:06:33
We're waiting right here.

120
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
Joseph!

121
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
One needn't worry.They shan't be long.

122
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
It's just that we do havesome large parties waiting.

123
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
Oh, one really does have a stickup one's ass, doesn't one?

124
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
How can you smoke in this day and age?Have you not seen that ad?

125
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
Where the little kid walksthrough Grandpa? It's chilling!

126
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
I messed up. It was a meeting.Everybody was smoking.

127
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
So what? Don't you have any willpower?

128
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
Willpower? I've watched home moviesof you eating Ding Dongs...

129
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
...without taking the tinfoil off!

130
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
You said that was sexy!

131
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
Okay, look, can we just drop this?I'm not gonna smoke again.

132
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
That's right, because I forbid youto smoke again.

133
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
You forbid me?

134
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
I've flown a long wayto see my loving wife.

135
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
Is she here, by the way?

136
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
Chandler, don't joke with me. Okay?I'm very, very upset right now.

137
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
- Is this the most upset you could be?- I think so.

138
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
Well, then I might as well...

139
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
...do this.

140
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
Not really sure what to do now.

141
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

142
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
We're already latefor Phoebe's birthday dinner.

143
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
So you're going to put outthat cigarette...

144
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
...we're gonna put this fight on hold,and go have sex.

145
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
Fine. What?

146
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating.If we don't do it...

147
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
...we're gonna have to waituntil next month!

148
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
You're serious?

149
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
- Oh, yeah!- All right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking!

150
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
- And no cuddling.- And no kissing your neck.

151
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
Oh, good! I hate it when you do that!

152
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
And lots of kissing your neck!

153
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
Okay, well, the super's not home.

154
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
But my mother's gonna be here,and she has the key.

155
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
I can't wait that long. You have to dosomething. Knock that door down!

156
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
I would, but I bruise like a peach.

157
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
Besides, you know, everything'sgonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.

158
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
- What if she jumps out of the bassinet?- Can't hold her head up, but jumped.

159
00:08:27 --> 00:08:28
Oh, my God!I left the water running!

160
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
You did not leave the water running.Please, pull yourself together, okay?

161
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
- Well, did I leave the stove on?- You haven't cooked since 1996.

162
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
Is the window open? If the window'sopen a bird could fly in and...

163
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
My God, you know what?I think you're right.

164
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
- Listen.- What? What?

165
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
A pigeon. No. No, wait, no.An eagle flew in!

166
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Landed on the stove and caught fire!

167
00:08:50 --> 00:08:55
The baby, seeing this, jumps acrossthe apartment to the mighty bird's aid.

168
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
The eagle, however, misconstrues thisas an act of aggression...

169
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
...and grabs the baby in its talon.

170
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
Meanwhile, the faucetfills the apartment with water.

171
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
Baby and bird, still ablaze,are locked in a death grip...

172
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
...swirling around the whirlpoolthat fills the apartment!

173
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
Boy, are you gonna be sorryif that's true.

174
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
- Hello.- Hi.

175
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
It's been an hour.

176
00:09:18 --> 00:09:22
The maitre d' asked if you'd reconsiderswitching to a smaller table.

177
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
Maybe we should just eat now.

178
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
You can't order until the entireparty's arrived. Restaurant policy.

179
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
Well, how about this?Another table leaves, right...

180
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
...but there's still some food lefton their plates.

181
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
Okay, what's the restaurant's policyabout people eating that?

182
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
- It's frowned upon.- But it happens.

183
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
- All right, I got to go to the bathroom.- You can't go.

184
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
No, no, no.I can't hold this table on my own.

185
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
If they ask me to move, I'll cave.

186
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
Well, if you ask me to stay, I'll pee.

187
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
Good evening, miss.

188
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
Miss?

189
00:09:58 --> 00:09:59
Miss? Miss?

190
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
Okay, fine, I'll move. All right.You don't have to manhandle me.

191
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
Where? Okay.

192
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
Thank you. Wow.

193
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
Finally. You guys made it.

194
00:10:22 --> 00:10:23
Pheebs, who the hell...?

195
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
Spend more time with the tie!That will make a baby.

196
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36
Look, I can't do this. I can't make loveto you while we're fighting this way.

197
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
Oh, sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.

198
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
But when you wanted to have sexafter my uncle's funeral...

199
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
That was a celebration of life!

200
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
All right, I'm not gonna do this.

201
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
Is this the way you want our babyto be conceived?

202
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
No, you're right.

203
00:10:51 --> 00:10:52
No, we shouldn't do it like this.

204
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

205
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
I shouldn't have come down on youso hard about the smoking.

206
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
So you had a few cigarettes.It's not the end of the world.

207
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
- Really?- Yeah.

208
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
You are incredible.

209
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
And listen,I'm not gonna smoke again.

210
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
And if I do, I promiseI will hide it so much better from you.

211
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
- Want to?- Let's celebrate life!

212
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
Okay!

213
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
Oh, God.

214
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Oh, thank God you're okay.

215
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
I'm sorry we left.Mommy will never leave you again.

216
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
Never, ever, ever again.

217
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
Great. So let's get going.

218
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
I mean it. After what just happened,I'm never leaving her again.

219
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
I understand. Separation is hard.

220
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
One time I was about to leave Rossto go to the beauty parlor.

221
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
And he got so upsethe took off all his clothes...

222
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
...tucked his willy between his legs...

223
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
...and cried out, "Mommy, I'm a girl.Take me with you."

224
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
Somehow, over time,it got easier to be apart from you.

225
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
You are welcome.

226
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
- You know what? Let's not talk.- What?

227
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
- I am still so mad at you for smoking!- But you said you forgave me.

228
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
It was just a couple of cigarettes,no big deal.

229
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
I was ovulating and you said youwouldn't have sex if we were fighting.

230
00:12:21 --> 00:12:26
- You tricked me to get me into bed?- That's right. I got mine.

231
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
I feel so used.

232
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
Well, I guess they're not coming.You want to just order?

233
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
Thank you.

234
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
Waiter? All right, this is gonnago fast, so try to keep up.

235
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
Risotto with shaved trufflesand the rib steak...

236
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
...with the golden chanterellesand the Bordelaise sauce...

237
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
...unless any of that stuff I just saidmeans "snails."

238
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
- It does not.- Tomato tart...

239
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
...and which of the pastaswould you recommend?

240
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
- Oh, well they're both exquisite...- Both it is. Thank you.

241
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
Oh, can I make a special request?

242
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
Can you bring everythingas it's ready?

243
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
- Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.- Hey!

244
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
- I'll wait to put your order in.- You guys are over an hour late.

245
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
- What happened to you two?- So sorry.

246
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
- We got locked out of the apartment.- That's a great story. Can I eat it?

247
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
And then Rachel wasn't sureshe could leave the baby.

248
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
It wasn't easy, but it's your birthdayand I did what I had to do.

249
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
And that's Judy over there at the barwith Emma?

250
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
This is for the best. I'm not distracted,worrying about Emma...

251
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
...how she's doing at home, and I'mgonna be completely here with you.

252
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
- Oh, she spit up. She spit up.- What?

253
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
Judy? She spit...Judy, look alive, Judy!

254
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
- Thank you.- Thanks.

255
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
Oh, everything looks delicious.

256
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
What should I have?What should I have?

257
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
Never hit a woman.Never hit a woman.

258
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
I know what you mean,this menu's incredible.

259
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
Ross bruises like a peach.He bruises like a peach.

260
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
Okay, I'll have the fig saladand the duck.

261
00:13:54 --> 00:13:55
I'll have the soup and the salmon.

262
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
Remember, whatever comes up first,okay?

263
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
- Hurry...- Happy birthday!

264
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
Son of a bitch!

265
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
- Where have you been?- Well, we had a little fight.

266
00:14:03 --> 00:14:04
I would never lieto get someone into bed.

267
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
You used to tell girlsyou were a Kennedy.

268
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
Thanks.

269
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
Thanks. Wow.

270
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
A little tight, isn't it?Why didn't you get a bigger table?

271
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
You had a big tablebut they made you move.

272
00:14:21 --> 00:14:22
Shut up, Monica.

273
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
Oh, well, I suppose that Chandlerwill have the smoked duck.

274
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
And I suppose that Monicawill have the manipulative shrew.

275
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
- I'll give you another minute.- What, where you going?

276
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
He said she wanted the shrew!

277
00:14:38 --> 00:14:39
Rach, come on, Emma's fine.

278
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
You're turning into an obsessivemother, okay? You need to stop.

279
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
You ever hear the story about whenRoss' mom went to the beauty salon?

280
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
- You mean the willy story?- They already know it.

281
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
We've been waiting for youfor a long time.

282
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
- You should order.- That's okay.

283
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
- I told the waiter what they want.- Why would you do that?

284
00:15:01 --> 00:15:02
Chandler, control your woman.

285
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
Okay, well...Everybody has ordered.

286
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
I would like to start the celebrationand make a toast to Phoebe.

287
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
- She dropped her sock.- What?

288
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
- No. No, Emma dropped her sock.- Mom's here?

289
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
I wanted to have lunch with her today.She told me she was out of town.

290
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
She still has not noticedthat the baby's sock is on the ground.

291
00:15:23 --> 00:15:24
It's a good toast.

292
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Look, will you please get her attention?

293
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
Mommy?

294
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
Oh, for God's sake, Judy,pick up the sock!

295
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!

296
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
I'm sorry, was that rude?

297
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
Did my little outburst...

298
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
...blunt the hideousnessthat is this evening?

299
00:15:53 --> 00:15:54
Look, I know you have a lot going on...

300
00:15:54 --> 00:15:59
...but all I wanted to do was havedinner with my friends on my birthday.

301
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
And you are all so late, and youdidn't even have the courtesy to call.

302
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
Well, it's too late now.

303
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
Pheebs, I don't think that's us.

304
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
Oh, well, this is... This is not over!Hello?

305
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
- What is going on with you two?- Well, you see, I'm ovulating.

306
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
Oh, yeah, that's what she says.

307
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
Maybe you're not ovulating. Maybeit's a clever ruse to get me into bed.

308
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
Yeah, Smokey, that's what it was.I just can't get enough.

309
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
You're not gonna believe this.

310
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
She tricked meinto having sex with her.

311
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
So? You got to have sex, right?

312
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
What's the matter with me?Why am I such a girl?

313
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
- Okay. That was Mike.- Oh, Phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.

314
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
You are totally right.We are here 100 percent...

315
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
...and we love you, and we are readyto start your birthday celebration.

316
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
You guys, that means the world to me.

317
00:16:53 --> 00:16:54
Okay, I'm gonna take off.

318
00:16:56 --> 00:16:57
What?

319
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
I love you guys too, butMike got off work early.

320
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
Wait.

321
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
I'm not the... I'm not the kind of girlthat just ditches her friends...

322
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
...to be with her boyfriend.

323
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
You know what? I am.

324
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
Bye, guys. Judy! Bye.

325
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
If Phoebe's gone,can we take Emma home?

326
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
That's a good idea. Our babysitterjust pounded another chardonnay.

327
00:17:17 --> 00:17:18
- Bye, you guys.- Bye.

328
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
See you. Well, I guess it's just us.

329
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
So I'm probably still ovulating.Do you want to give it another try?

330
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
So you've never had sexwith a Kennedy, have you?

331
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
- You're gonna go do it?- We don't have much time.

332
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
Once the egg descends into thefallopian tube...

333
00:17:35 --> 00:17:36
Oh, wait, oh, get out of here!

334
00:17:40 --> 00:17:43
I sincerely hope the rest of your partyis returning.

335
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
No, just me. All alone.

336
00:17:48 --> 00:17:51
Dinner for six for one.

337
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
Well, you boys are aboutto see something really special.

338
00:18:04 --> 00:18:05
- How was everything?- Excellent.

339
00:18:06 --> 00:18:08
The shrew, in particular, was exquisite.

340
00:18:09 --> 00:18:10
I hope you've got some room left.

341
00:18:17 --> 00:18:18
Joey. Joey.

342
00:18:22 --> 00:18:23
This is the best birthday ever!
