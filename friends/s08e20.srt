00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
- Hi!- Hey!

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
So, what's the final head counton my baby shower?

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Twenty. Some work peoplehad things to do.

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
Your sisters can't make it.

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
They're not comingto a social event...

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
...where there's no men and no booze?That's shocking.

7
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
As long as my mom's here.

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
- Oh, my God. Your mother.- My mom's not gonna be here?

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
Given we forgot to invite her, it'dbe a big coincidence if she was.

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
My God!

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
Phoebe was in chargeof the invitations.

12
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
I don't have a mother.Often I forget...

13
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
Oh, give it a rest.

14
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
So my mother is not comingto my baby shower?

15
00:00:39 --> 00:00:40
No.

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
Neither is mine.

17
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
We'll take care of it. We'll call her.You go home and get ready.

18
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
Make sure she comes.It's important. It's my mom.

19
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
- I know. What's her number?- I don't know.

20
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
Go. I have it in my book. Go.

21
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
If you're in charge of invitations,why am I calling her?

22
00:01:03 --> 00:01:05
Hello, Mrs. Green!Hi, it's Monica Geller.

23
00:01:05 --> 00:01:06
- Hi.

24
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
It's last-minute, but we've decidedto throw an impromptu...

25
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
...baby shower for Rachel today.- My daughters told me...

26
00:01:13 --> 00:01:17
...when they received their impromptuinvitations a month ago.

27
00:01:17 --> 00:01:20
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."- For what", "dear?"

28
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
For not inviting me,or for lying about it?

29
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.

30
00:01:26 --> 00:01:30
Please, please, can you come?It starts at 4:00.

31
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
- Well, all right. I'll see you at 4:00.- Thank you.

32
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38
- Isn't it at 3:00?- Son of a bitch!

38
00:02:14 --> 00:02:14

00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
But by night, I'll be Joey Tribbiani!

41
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
You'd be perfect! That's your name!

42
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
The audition's soon,and I don't understand the game.

43
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
Do you want help?

44
00:02:28 --> 00:02:32
Oh, really? That'd be great.Hey, you guys can be the contestants!

45
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35

Well, I'm a paleontologist.I live in New York.

51
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
I have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And...

52
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
I said, "a little bit."How about you, Chandler?

53
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
I'm a headhunter. I hook upout-of-work Soviet scientists...

54
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
...with rogue Third World nations.Hi, Rasputin.

55
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
Excellent! Let's play!Chandler, you'll go first.

56
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
- What is the capital of Colombia?- Bogota.

57
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
It's Bogota, but close enough.

58
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
You can either pass your turn to Rossor pick a Wicked Wango Card.

59
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
- What does a Wicked Wango Card do?- I should know that.

60
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
Let's see. One moment, please...

61
00:03:22 --> 00:03:27
Here we are. A Wicked Wango Carddetermines if you go higher or lower.

62
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Higher or lower than what?

63
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
- This is embarrassing!- Can you believe how lame this is?

64
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
I'm sorry. I don't believe contestantsare allowed to talk to each other.

65
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
I told the stripper to be here at 5.That's good, right?

66
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
You ordered a stripper?That is inappropriate.

67
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.

68
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.I'm so glad you could make it.

69
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
Thank you so much. We're so sorry.We could not feel worse about it.

70
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
Try.

71
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
There's my little girl!

72
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
- She's still mad.- Yeah, I know.

73
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
Isn't it great? One lessperson to make small talk with.

74
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.It doesn't bother you?

75
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
We've apologized twice.I can't do any more than that.

76
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
You hate it when peopleare mad at you...

77
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
...but you just haveto be okay with it.

78
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
Okay. I can do that.

79
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
- I gotta go powder my ass.- Oh.

80
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
That face! Like whenyou were in high school.

81
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
If I didn't know better, I'd sayyou're a cheerleader in trouble.

82
00:04:30 --> 00:04:31
Come, let's get some tea.

83
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Oh, my! Look at that.Only three weeks to go.

84
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
Did you pick a nanny? If you use yourmaid, it will split her focus.

85
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.And I don't have a maid.

86
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
It's like you're a cave person.

87
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
You must get a nanny. You don'tknow how overwhelming it will be.

88
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
When you were a baby, I had Mrs. K.

89
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.She taught me Spanish.

90
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
I actually thinkI remember some of it:

91
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
Tu madre esta loca.

92
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Such a sweet woman.

93
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
As great as she was,I can't afford that.

94
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
- Oh, Rachel!- What?

95
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
I just had a great idea!I'm gonna come live with you!

96
00:05:11 --> 00:05:12
What? What?

97
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonnado this for my little girl.

98
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
Look at you.You have tears in your eyes.

99
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
Yes, yes, I do.

100
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
Ross is in the lead.

101
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
Another question,or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

102
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
The Wheel has not beenmy friend tonight, Joey.

103
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
I'll take another question.

104
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
This is tough. Hold your breath.

105
00:05:35 --> 00:05:36
It's okay. I'm ready.

106
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
You gotta hold your breathuntil you answer.

107
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
This is ridiculous! He's not gonna...

108
00:05:42 --> 00:05:47
Okay. What do you have a fear of ifyou suffer from this phobia? Triska...

109
00:05:47 --> 00:05:51
Holy cow. That's a big word. Tris...

110
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
Look at this. How do you say that?

111
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
- Let me see that.- This one right here.

112
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
- Triskaidekaphobia.- Fear of Triscuits!

113
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
- No! No. Fear of the number 13.- Fear of Triscuits?

114
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
It's possible.They have really sharp edges.

115
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
Chandler, you're up.

116
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
I'm entitled to use my Angel Passfor a free turn.

117
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
- This game makes no sense!- You're upset because you're losing.

118
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
Oh, come on, Ross.I think we're all losers here.

119
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
You can either spin the Wheelor pick a Google Card.

120
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
Let me think, let me think.Oh, I don't care.

121
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
You must choose.

122
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
- Either. It makes no difference.- Choose, you jackass.

123
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
- I'll take a card.- You picked the Gimme Card!

124
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
- You get all of Ross' points!- What?

125
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
This game is kind of fun!

126
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
You don't think it's crazyyou get my points...?

127
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
The contestants aren't supposedto speak to each other.

128
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
- Why did you invite my mother?- What?

129
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
She wants to move inand help care for the baby.

130
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
- For how long?- Eight weeks.

131
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
I love my mother, but, my God,a long lunch with her is taxing.

132
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
I'd be honored if she wantedto live with me.

133
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
She can't hear you.

134
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
What am I gonna do?

135
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
If you don't want her to movein with you, just tell her.

136
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
You're right.I'm about to have a baby.

137
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
I can say I don't wanther sleeping on my couch.

138
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
She'll wanna sleep in my bed.This can't happen.

139
00:07:17 --> 00:07:18
That is right.

140
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
Tell her you don't want herto live with you.

141
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Do not take no for an answer.

142
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
This is great! Now she'sgonna be mad at Rachel!

143
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
And I'm just gonna swoop in there andbe like the daughter she never had.

144
00:07:31 --> 00:07:35
I have new respect for Chandler.

145
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
All right, everybody!It's time to open the presents!

146
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Yes! The first giftthat Rachel opens...

147
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
...should be from the grandmother.

148
00:07:43 --> 00:07:48
Because you're the most importantperson in this room! And in the world!

149
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
I don't have onebecause I was invited late.

150
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
But thank you so much, dear, forbringing that to everybody's attention.

151
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
How about you less important people?Let's open your presents!

152
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
- It's okay that you didn't get a gift.- I kind of did.

153
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
Me! Eight weeks of me.

154
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
Okay. See, Mom?The truth is, I can do this on my own.

155
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.

156
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
But you need help at the beginning.

157
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
I know what I'm doing.I can handle it.

158
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
Really? Remember Twinkles?

159
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
He was a hamster.I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!

160
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
Okay, come on, Rach.It's present time!

161
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
You're the glue holdingthis party together.

162
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
It's kind of falling apart here.

163
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
- Oh, look!- Wow!

164
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
This is from work friends.

165
00:08:33 --> 00:08:38
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow!Oh, I know what this is.

166
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
Wait a minute.

167
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
That can't be right.

168
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
Is that a beer bong for a baby?

169
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Darling, that's a breast pump.

170
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
Did I say I was done guessing?Okay, thank you for that.

171
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
Oh, wow! What's this?

172
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
- It's a Diaper Genie.- It dispenses clean diapers!

173
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
It's where you put dirty ones.

174
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
Why don't you take it outsideand throw it in a dumpster?

175
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
- You're gonna do that 10 times a day?- What, it goes 10 times a day?

176
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
Are we feeding this baby Indian food?

177
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
No, dear. That's what babies do.

178
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
Rachel, listen to your mother.She is very smart.

179
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
What will you do with the babywhile you trot out to the garbage?

180
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
I don't know,I'd leave it on the changing table?

181
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
- What? What did I do? What did I do?- You can't leave a baby alone.

182
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
Of course, I know that!

183
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
Of course you never leavea baby alone.

184
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
It would...She wouldn't be safe.

185
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
Not as safe as she would bewith me, the baby dummy.

186
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
Opening the presents is a littleoverwhelming right now.

187
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
I'm gonna maybe openthem all a little bit later.

188
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
Thank you for coming,for the gifts...

189
00:09:46 --> 00:09:51
...and this basket is beautiful.- It's actually a bassinet.

190
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.

191
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59

199
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24

00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
I'd like to spin the Wheel.

203
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
Oh, come on!

204
00:10:36 --> 00:10:37
Super Speedy Speed Round.

205
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
- Is there a Hopping Bonus?- Of course.

206
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44

207
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
Which monarch ruledGreat Britain the longest?

208
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
Queen Victoria!

209
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
You forgot to switch legs betweenquestions. No Hopping Bonus!

210
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Every time!

211
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
- Yeah. Now over to Chandler.- I'd like a Google Card.

212
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
- Are you sure?- Yes! No! Google!

213
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05

214
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
...you've been Bamboozled!- No!

215
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
- Yes!- This is the best game ever!

216
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
You'll stay as long as I need you?

217
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
- Of course.- I swear I'm not an idiot.

218
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
I read books on pregnancyand giving birth.

219
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
I didn't think to read about whatto do when the baby comes.

220
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
And the baby's coming...

221
00:11:23 --> 00:11:28
...and I don't know what to do.Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?

222
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.

223
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
- Where you going?- I'm going to the bathroom.

224
00:11:33 --> 00:11:37
Now, don't worry.Everything's gonna be okay.

225
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
It is gonna be okay!

226
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
Worth a shot.

227
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?

228
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
I just Bamboozled Chandler!

229
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
Which is not a sexual thing.

230
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
- Well, that was a quick shower.- Not if you were here.

231
00:12:00 --> 00:12:01
We got good stuff.

232
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
We did. My mom gotus the greatest gift of all.

233
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
A Play-Doh Barbershop?

234
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
No. She's going to livewith us for eight weeks.

235
00:12:10 --> 00:12:11
What?

236
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
Yes! She's gonna help ustake care of the baby!

237
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
You're not serious!

238
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
She's a very nice woman,but we can't take eight weeks of her.

239
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
- She'll drive us crazy...- Hi, Ross!

240
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
Hey, roomie!

241
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
Hey, I'm Ray.I'm the producer of the show.

242
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.

243
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
This is Duncan and Erin.They're gonna help with the audition.

244
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
- Right, Ray.- Whenever you're ready.

245
00:12:41 --> 00:12:45
Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.Let's play Bamboozled!

246
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
Erin, first question. In hockey,who is known as "The Great One"?

247
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
- Gretzky.- Correct!

248
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
Want to pick a Wicked Wango Cardor spin the Wheel?

249
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
Didn't your agents giveyou the revised rules?

250
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
We've eliminated all that.No wheel. No cards.

251
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
Why?

252
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
It was too complicated.People didn't follow it.

253
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
Complicated?! Spin the Wheelto go up the Ladder of Chance...

254
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
...through the Rainbow Ringto the Golden Monkey.

255
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
You yank his tail,and you're in Paradise Pond!

256
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
Yeah. All that's gone.

257
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
It's a simple question-and-answer game now.

258
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
Well, what's fun about that?

259
00:13:19 --> 00:13:23
You expect me to host a boring gameof people answering questions?

260
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
Women in bikinis hold up the scores.

261
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
Let's play Bamboozled!

262
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
Oh, and all those dinosaurknickknacks you have...

263
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
They might be better in the garage.

264
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
- Well, we don't have a garage.- Did I say garage? I meant garbage.

265
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
You know what? Maybe it's notabsolutely vital that you live with us.

266
00:13:42 --> 00:13:47
- Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.- I really do. I don't know anything.

267
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
I'm sure that's untrue.

268
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
Oh, no?Do I know anything about babies?

269
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
- No. Not a thing.- It's frightening.

270
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
Even if she doesn'tknow anything, I do.

271
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
I have a son. His motherand I didn't live together.

272
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
When he was with me, I tookcare of him all the time, by myself.

273
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
- That's true. You do have another child.- Yeah.

274
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
With another woman.

275
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
Have you no control, Ross?

276
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
That's a different issue.

277
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
The point is, when the baby comes,I will be there to feed her...

278
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
...and bathe her and change her.

279
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
I want to do all those things.

280
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
- You don't need me to live with you.- Yes!

281
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.

282
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
- You'll be a great father.- You'll be a wonderful grandma.

283
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
Hello? I still don't knowwhat the hell I'm doing!

284
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
Every first-time motherfeels that way.

285
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will.Look, when you first came to the city...

286
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
...you were a spoiled, helpless littlegirl who used Daddy's credit cards!

287
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
I hope you're goingsomewhere with this.

288
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
Look at you.You're this big executive.

289
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
You are very capable.

290
00:14:56 --> 00:15:00
I have no doubt you're gonnabe an incredible mother.

291
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
- Really?- I'm telling you.

292
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
Thank you.

293
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
All right. I'm gonna get going.

294
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
No, sweetheart, stay put.

295
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
I'll let myself out. It's like I'mnot here. Which I almost wasn't.

296
00:15:15 --> 00:15:20
You're just so funny. You're so funny.What do I do?

297
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
Nothing. You have apologizedto her like a million times.

298
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
And she's been nothingbut terrible to you.

299
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
You just threw her daughter a lovely,albeit slightly boring, shower.

300
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
- And she hasn't even thanked you for it.- You know what? You're right.

301
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
If you wanna say anything,I'd tell her off.

302
00:15:37 --> 00:15:38
Really?

303
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
Okay, I will.

304
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
Mrs. Green?

305
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
Mrs. Green?

306
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
It is rude not to saygoodbye to the host.

307
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
When someone apologizes to you,the decent thing to do is to accept it.

308
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
What I did wasn't on purpose.

309
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
But what you're doing to me nowis plain spiteful.

310
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
- Spiteful?- Right.

311
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
It's time you took a goodlook in the mirror, young lady!

312
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
Old lady!

313
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
Lady!

314
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

315
00:16:07 --> 00:16:12
So whenever you're ready to apologizeto me, I will forgive you. Good day.

316
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
I can't feel my legs!

317
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
You were fantastic!I'm so proud of you.

318
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
- Yeah? I'm proud of me too.- You should be.

319
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
- Could you get me something to drink?- You got it!

320
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry!I apologize. If you...

321
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
Okay! I bit my tongue!

322
00:16:34 --> 00:16:37
But I'm still really sorry!

323
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
- Okay, I'm ready.- You sure?

324
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
I've done my studying,and I know my stuff.

325
00:16:46 --> 00:16:47
All right, then.

326
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
Rachel Green,let's play Bamboozled!

327
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
How do you testbathwater temperature?

328
00:16:54 --> 00:16:55
- Put your elbow in it.- Good!

329
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
- How do you let a baby nap?- Full, dry, on its back, no loose covers.

330
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
Correct!

331
00:17:00 --> 00:17:05
This is an audio question. What doyou do when a baby makes this sound:

332
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
Check if it's wet or hungry, burp it.

333
00:17:10 --> 00:17:14
Excellent! Now do you want anotherquestion or a Wicked Wango Card?

334
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
- A card! A card! I pick a card!- Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
You've been Bamboozled!You're gonna be a terrible mother!

336
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
I've lost sight of whywe're doing this!

337
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
