1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
Any entertainment there?

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:07
All right. Here we go!1999, the year of Joey.

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
We're very happy for you.

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
What's the matter?

5
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
We wanted to kiss at midnight,but nobody else will so...

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:16
All right, I'll take care of it.

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Thirty-three... thirty-two...thirty-one...

8
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
Who are you kissing at midnight?Rachel or Phoebe?

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
You can't kiss your sister.

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
- Who will kiss my sister?- Chandler.

11
00:00:24 --> 00:00:25
Oh, man! Really?

12
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
Would you ratherhave me or him kiss her?

13
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
That's a good point.

14
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
Since I have that whole historywith Rachel, I guess Phoebe.

15
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
Pheebs! Listen.Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.

16
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
So obvious.Why doesn't he just ask?

17
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
I'm going to kiss you at midnight.

18
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
You can't kiss Ross.You got the history.

19
00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
So?

20
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
- Would you prefer me or Chandler?- Good point.

21
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
Three... two... one!

22
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
Happy New Year!

23
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
- Happy New Year.- You too.

24
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
Happy New Year, Joey.

25
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
So, that do anything for you?

26
00:01:03 --> 00:01:05
The One withAll the Resolutions

27
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41
You know what?

28
00:01:41 --> 00:01:45
I'm going to go out on a limband say, "No divorces in '99"!

29
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
But your divorce isn't final yet.

30
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
Just the one divorce in '99!

31
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
I'm going to be happy this year.I'm going to make myself happy.

32
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
Do you want us to leave the room?

33
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
Every day, I am going to do one thingI have never done before.

34
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
That is my New Year's resolution.

35
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
That's a good one!

36
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.

37
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
Now you only have to finda planeload of people...

38
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
...whose resolution isto plummet to their deaths.

39
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
Maybe your resolution should benot to make fun of your friends.

40
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
Especially the ones who mightfly you to Europe for free.

41
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
She has a better chanceof flying up your nose...

42
00:02:22 --> 00:02:25
...than you do ofnot making fun of us.

43
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
I'll bet $50 you can't go the yearwithout making fun of us.

44
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
Better yet, a week.

45
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
I'll take that bet, my friend.

46
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Paying me the $50 can be...

47
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
...the "new thing you do" that day.

48
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
And it starts right now!

49
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
My New Year's resolution isto learn how to play guitar.

50
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
Really? How come?

51
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
You know those special skillsI have listed on my résumé?

52
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
I would love itif one of those was true.

53
00:02:50 --> 00:02:51
Want me to teach you?I'm great.

54
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
Really?Who have you taught?

55
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
I taught me and I loved me.

56
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
That'd be great!Yeah, thanks, Pheebs.

57
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
Look. Blaire forgot her glasses.

58
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
She'll need these to keep an eyeon that boyfriend.

59
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
Who, from what I hear,needs to keep his stapler...

60
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
...in his desk drawer,if you know what I mean!

61
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
Maybe your resolutionshould be to gossip less.

62
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
What? I don't gossip.

63
00:03:15 --> 00:03:16
Maybe sometimes I find out things.

64
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
Or I hear somethingand I pass that information on.

65
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
You know, kind oflike a public service.

66
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
It doesn't mean I'm a gossip.Is Ted Koppel a gossip?

67
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
If Ted Koppel talked about hiscoworkers' botched boob jobs, I would.

68
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
They were like this!

69
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
I'll see you tomorrow.

70
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
I just asked that girl out.

71
00:03:41 --> 00:03:42
Nice!

72
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
Is that part ofyour "new thing" for today?

73
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
Yes, it is. See?

74
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
"Elizabeth...

75
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
...Hornswoggle?"

76
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
That's right.

77
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

78
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
You okay, Chandler?

79
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Something funny about that name?

80
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
No, I just thinkI've heard it somewhere before.

81
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
Oh, really? Where?

82
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
Somewhere funny I'll bet.

83
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
Guess what?

84
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
I have a datewith Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

85
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
Oh, this must be killing you!

86
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
All right, see you later.

87
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
All right, Pheebs,I am ready for my first lesson.

88
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
No, you don't touch the guitar.

89
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
First you learn here, then here.

90
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
Lesson One: Chords.

91
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
Now, I don't knowthe actual names of the chords.

92
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
But I made up names for the waymy hand looks while I'm doing them.

93
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
So then, this is "Bear Claw".

94
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
"Turkey Leg"...

95
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
...and "Old Lady".

96
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
What an interesting approachto guitar instruction!

97
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05
You know, some might find it amusing.I myself find it regular.

98
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
Hey, everybody!

99
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
Rachel was so good today.She didn't gossip at all.

100
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
I didn't.Even when I found out...

101
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Let's say I found outsomething about someone...

102
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
...and let's just say...

103
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
...she's going to keep it.

104
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
Check this out.

105
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
You nailed the Old Lady!

106
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
I thought I was getting better,so I stopped by this guitar store...

107
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
Did you touchany of the guitars there?

108
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Did you?

109
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
No.

110
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Give me your hands.

111
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
Strings.

112
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
Pick.

113
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
Do you want to learn to play guitar?

114
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
Then don't touch one!

115
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
- Hi, Ben.- Auntie Monica!

116
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
Ross is wearing leather pants!

117
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
Does nobody else seeRoss is wearing leather pants?

118
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
Someone comment on the pants!

119
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
- I think they're very nice.- I really like them a lot.

120
00:06:17 --> 00:06:18
Not what I had in mind.

121
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
People like Ross don't wearthese types of pants.

122
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
You see, they're very tight.

123
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
Maybe there's something in that area?

124
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
I think they look really good.

125
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
Where'd you get them?

126
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
I needed a "new thing" for today.

127
00:06:33 --> 00:06:36
There's this leather storethat always smells so good.

128
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
And I thought to myself, "Wow!I've never owned...

129
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
...a really good-smellingpair of pants before."

130
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
Oh, come on!

131
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
What do you think?

132
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
You look like a freak.

133
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
Awful!

134
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
What are you doing?

135
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
- It's my New Year's resolution.- To blind my child?

136
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
To take pictures of us together.

137
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
It's the best resolution.Everyone can enjoy them.

138
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
Everyone will enjoy my music as well.

139
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
I'm burning up.

140
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
Is she trying to kill me?

141
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
It's like a volcano in here!

142
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
Are you hot?

143
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
It must just be me then.

144
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
That was just the pantsand the couch.

145
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?

146
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
- Go ahead.- Thanks.

147
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
My favorite part's coming up!

148
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
Oh, my God!

149
00:08:43 --> 00:08:44
"Tiger."

150
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
"Dragon."

151
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
"Iceberg!"

152
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
Joseph, did you even studyat all last night?

153
00:08:50 --> 00:08:51
Yes, I did!

154
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
Then do Iceberg.

155
00:08:53 --> 00:08:54
G-sharp.

156
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
G-sharp?

157
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
Have you been studyingthe real names of the chords?

158
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
Have you?

159
00:09:02 --> 00:09:03
Oh, my God!

160
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
What? I didn't touch a guitar!

161
00:09:05 --> 00:09:06
But you're questioning my method!

162
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
No, I'm not questioning it.I'm saying it's stupid!

163
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
What?

164
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
Thank you.

165
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
You know, none of my other student...

166
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
...thought I was stupid.

167
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
Your other student was you!

168
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
Well, maybe you just needto try a little harder!

169
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Maybe I need to try a real teacher!

170
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
Here! Andy Cooper.He teaches guitar.

171
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
There's a picture of him with a kid.

172
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
And the kid's got a guitar!

173
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
Fine!

174
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
You learn fromyour "qualified instructor".

175
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
But don't come cryingwhen everyone is sick...

176
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
...of hearing you play"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"!

177
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
Oh, fine. Take his side!

178
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
I can't wait to be with you.

179
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
I'll sneak over as soon as I can.

180
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
I'll be doing laundry.

181
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
Is that my new nickname?

182
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
Mr. Big...

183
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
Joey, it's Ross.I need some help.

184
00:10:20 --> 00:10:21
Chandler's not here.

185
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
You can help me.

186
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.

187
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
Nice!

188
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
No, I got really hot in my pantsso I took them off.

189
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
But they must have shrunkfrom the sweat.

190
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
Or my legs expanded from the heat.

191
00:10:37 --> 00:10:42
I can't get them back on, Joey.I can't!

192
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
That is quite a situation.

193
00:10:46 --> 00:10:47
Do you see any powder?

194
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
Powder! Yeah, I have powder.

195
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
Good, good.

196
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Sprinkle some on.It'll absorb moisture.

197
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
Then you can get your pants on.

198
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
Yeah, hold on.

199
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
They're not coming on, man.

200
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
You see any...Oh, Vaseline?

201
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
I see lotion. I have lotion.Will that work?

202
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
Sure, throw some of that on there.

203
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
Hold on.

204
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
Ross, you okay?

205
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
They're still not coming on, man.

206
00:11:41 --> 00:11:45
And the lotion and the powderhave made a paste.

207
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
Really?

208
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
What color is it?

209
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
What difference does that make?

210
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
If the paste matches the pants,you can make paste pants...

211
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
...and she won't know!

212
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
Do you have a minute?

213
00:11:59 --> 00:12:00
Dude, what am I...

214
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
Rachel's here, so good luck.Let me know how it goes.

215
00:12:05 --> 00:12:06
Joey, I have such a problem.

216
00:12:07 --> 00:12:08
Your timing couldn't be better.

217
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
I'm putting out firesall over the place.

218
00:12:13 --> 00:12:14
I have got to tell you something.

219
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
What is it?

220
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
It's so huge! But promise meyou cannot tell anyone.

221
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
No, no, no!I don't want to know.

222
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
You do want to know.This is unbelievable!

223
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
I'm tired of being the guywho knows all the secrets...

224
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
...and can't tell anyone.

225
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
You know secrets?

226
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
You're not supposed to gossip!

227
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
I can't keep this in.So I pick up the phone...

228
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
I'm not listening to you!

229
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
You've been in there for a long time.

230
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
I'm starting to getkind of freaked out.

231
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
All right, I'm coming out.

232
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
Hey, can you turn the lights off?

233
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
Let's just leave the lights on.

234
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
Oh, my God!

235
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
I had a problem.

236
00:13:24 --> 00:13:29
I can't talk to you. I don't havea fancy ad in the yellow pages.

237
00:13:32 --> 00:13:36
I want to apologize for sayingyour method was stupid.

238
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
And maybe, ask youto be my teacher again?

239
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
I promise, I won't touch a guitaruntil you say I'm ready.

240
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
You really think I'm ready?

241
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
Wow, cool!

242
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
Was the chord at least right...

243
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
Oh, my God!

244
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
We heard about your pants.I'm so sorry.

245
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
This year was supposed to be great.

246
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
It's only the second day,and I'm a loser...

247
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
...with stupid leather pantsthat don't even fit!

248
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
You're not a loser.

249
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
Look at me!

250
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
Hey, look!

251
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
Ben drew a picture of you.

252
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
You're a cowboy!

253
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
Because of the leather pants?

254
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
He thinks you're a cowboy,not a loser. That's something!

255
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
- It really is something.- Howdy, partner!

256
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
Maybe I should get another pair.

257
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
You know, they had some...

258
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
...with fringe all down the sides.

259
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
I'm going to go kiss Ben good night.

260
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
I can't believe he thinksI'm a cowboy!

261
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
I would make a good cowboy.

262
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Now that everything's wrapped up,I'll do my laundry.

263
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
Yeah, me too.If this shirt is dirty.

264
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
I'm going to the airport.

265
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
If I hang around therelong enough...

266
00:15:39 --> 00:15:43
...someone's bound to leavea plane unattended.

267
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
- Good luck, honey.- Bye.

268
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
Remember that thingI was going to tell you about?

269
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
I won't tell you.But if you found out on your own...

270
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
That would be okay,and we could talk about it.

271
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.So that would be okay.

272
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
Would you mind goinginto Chandler's bedroom...

273
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
...and getting that bookhe borrowed from me?

274
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
Now? You want meto go over there now?

275
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
- Do you know something?- Do you?

276
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
- I might know something.- I might too.

277
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
- What do you know?- You tell me first.

278
00:16:24 --> 00:16:25
- I can't.- Then I can't.

279
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Okay, fine.

280
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
You don't know.

281
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
I'll walk into his bedroomand see the thing...

282
00:16:37 --> 00:16:41
...I think I know is actuallythe thing I think I know!

283
00:16:41 --> 00:16:42
- You know!- And you know!

284
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
Yeah, I know!

285
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
Chandler and Monica?Oh, this is unbelievable!

286
00:16:46 --> 00:16:47
- How long have you known?- Too long!

287
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
I've been dying to talkto someone about this!

288
00:16:50 --> 00:16:55
You can't say anything to anybody.They're so weird about that.

289
00:16:57 --> 00:16:57
It's raining.

290
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
I don't like to fly in the rain.

291
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
I am going to go for a walkin the rain.

292
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
Me too.

293
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
That's weird.

294
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
I bet they're doing it.

295
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
Okay, look.I can't take it anymore.

296
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
So you win. Okay?Here.

297
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
Fly a jet?Make it a spaceship...

298
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
...so you can get backto your home planet!

299
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
Phone call for you. Tom Jones.He wants his pants back!

00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
