You ever figure outwhat that thing's for?

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
I'm trying this screening thing.

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
If I always answer the phone,people will think I have no life.

11
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31

00:00:33 --> 00:00:34
This is Jade.

14
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
at this number, but I was thinking...

15
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
I know it's been three years...

16
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
we could hook up again.

17
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
to make this call...

18
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
...so you know what I did?- What?

19
00:00:47 --> 00:00:48
I got a little drunk...

36
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
Great. I'll see you then.

37
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
Having a phone has finally paid off.

38
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
You do a good Bob impression...

39
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
...but when shesees you tomorrow...

40
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
...she's gonna realizeyou're not Bob.

41
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
I'm hoping that whenBob doesn't show up...

42
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
...she'll seek comfort in the arms ofthe stranger at the next table.

43
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
Oh, my God.You are pure evil.

44
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Okay, pure evil...

45
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
...horny and alone.

46
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
I've done this.

47
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Yeah, everybody's here.

While Ross is on the phone...

51
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
...everybody owes me62 bucks for his birthday.

52
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
Is there any chance thatyou're rounding up from...

53
00:02:50 --> 00:02:50
...you know...

54
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
...from like 20?

55
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
Hey, we got the gift,the concert and the cake.

56
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
Do we need a cake?

57
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
I know it's a little steep.

58
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
But it's Ross.

59
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
It's Ross.

60
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08

Okay, sweetheart,I'll call you later.

63
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
You're not goingthrough with this, are you?

64
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
You know, I think I might just.

65
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
What are you guysdoing for dinner tonight?

66
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
Well, I gotta startsaving up for Ross' birthday.

67
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
I guess I'll just stay homeand eat dust bunnies.

68
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Can you believehow much this costs?

69
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
Do you guys everget the feeling that...

70
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
...Chandler and those guys...

71
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
...don't get thatwe don't make that much money?

72
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
They always saylet's go here, let's go there.

73
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
Like we can afford to gohere and there.

74
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
Yes, and we always have to go to,you know, someplace nice.

75
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
And we can't say anything about it,because this is a birthday thing...

76
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
...and it's "for Ross".

77
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
For Ross.

78
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Oh, my God!

79
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
I'm at work...

80
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
...just an ordinary day,chop, chop, sauté, sauté.

81
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
Suddenly, Leon, the manager,calls me into his office.

82
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
They fired the lunch chef,and guess who got the job?

83
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
If it's not you,this is a horrible story.

84
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
Fortunately, it is me.

85
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
And they made me head of purchasing,thank you!

86
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
That's so cool!

87
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
Anyway, I think weshould go out and celebrate.

88
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
You know, someplace nice.

89
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
Someplace nice.

90
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
How much you thinkI can get for my kidney?

91
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
You can't do this.

92
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
I can't get a girl like thatwith conventional methods.

93
00:04:38 --> 00:04:39
It doesn't matter.

94
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
She wanted to call Bob. Bob could bewho she was meant to be with.

95
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
You may be destroyingtheir chance for happiness.

96
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
We don't know Bob.

97
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
We know me. We like me.Please let me be happy.

98
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
Go over thereand tell that woman the truth.

99
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
All right.

100
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
Go.

101
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
Listen, I have to...

102
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
I have to confess something.

103
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
Yes?

104
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

105
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
- How did you...- I don't know.

106
00:05:19 --> 00:05:24
I just had this weird sense.But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

107
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
Tissue?

108
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
Thanks.

109
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
No, you keep the pack.

110
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
I'm all cried out today.

111
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
Here is to my sister,the newly appointed head lunch chef.

112
00:05:48 --> 00:05:49
Also in charge of purchasing.

113
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
Head lunch chef,also in charge of purchasing...

114
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
Who has her own little deskwhen Roland's not there.

115
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
Lunch chef, purchasing, own little deskwhen Roland's not there...

116
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
...here's to my...- Wait! And I got a beeper!

117
00:06:04 --> 00:06:05
That's fine, I'll just wait.

118
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
Sorry.

119
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
Monica!

120
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
Are we ready to order?

121
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
We haven't even looked yet.

122
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
When you do, let me know.

123
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
I'll be over thereon the edge of my seat.

124
00:06:22 --> 00:06:23
Look at these prices!

125
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching".

126
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
I know! What are these,famous chickens?

127
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
Sorry I'm late.Congratulations, Mon.

128
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
I'm not sorry I'm late. How incrediblewas my afternoon with Jade?

129
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
Pretty incredible, according tothe message on my machine.

130
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
Why is this woman leaving a messagefor you on my machine?

131
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
I told her thatmy number was yours...

132
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
...because I couldn'ttell her it was mine...

133
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
...because she thinksmy number is Bob's number.

134
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
Tell me again.What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

135
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Do I dare ask?

136
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
I'll start with the carpaccio,and then the grilled prawns.

137
00:06:57 --> 00:06:58
Great, same for me.

138
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
And for the gentleman?

139
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

140
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
But if I get it withoutthe nuts and leeks and stuff...

141
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
...is it cheaper?

142
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
You'd think, wouldn't you?

143
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
I will have the side salad.

144
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
And what would thatbe on the side of?

145
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
I don't know.

146
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
Just put it right herenext to my water.

147
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
And for you?

148
00:07:22 --> 00:07:27
I'm gonna have a cupof the cucumber soup and...

149
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
...take care.

150
00:07:32 --> 00:07:33
I will have the Cajun catfish.

151
00:07:34 --> 00:07:34
Anything else?

152
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
Killing Me Softly?

153
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
You're gonna sneezein my fish, aren't you?

154
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
Plus tip, divided by six...

155
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Everyone owes 28 bucks.

156
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
Everyone?

157
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
Oh! You're right, I'm sorry.

158
00:07:55 --> 00:07:55
Thank you.

159
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
It's Monica's big night.She shouldn't pay.

160
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
So five of us is...

161
00:08:01 --> 00:08:02
...33.50 a piece.

162
00:08:03 --> 00:08:05
No. No way.Sorry, not gonna happen.

163
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Prom night flashback.

164
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
Sorry, Monica.I'm happy you got promoted...

165
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
...but cold cucumber mushfor 30-something bucks?

166
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
No!

167
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
Rachel just had that little salad...

168
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
...and Joey with his teeny pizza!

169
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
Okay, Pheebs.

170
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
How about we'll eachpay for what we had?

171
00:08:25 --> 00:08:26
It's no big deal.

172
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
Not for you.

173
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
All right, what's going on?

174
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
I don't wanna getinto this right now.

175
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
It'll make everybody uncomfortable.

176
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
You can tell us.

177
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
Yeah, hello? It's us.We'll be fine.

178
00:08:48 --> 00:08:49
We three...

179
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
...feel like that...

180
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
...sometimes you guys don't get that...

181
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
We don't haveas much money as you.

182
00:09:06 --> 00:09:07
I hear you.

183
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
We can talk about that.

184
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
Well, then...

185
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
...let's.

186
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
I guess I just never thinkof money as an issue.

187
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
- Because you have it.- Good point!

188
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
So how come you guyshaven't talked about this before?

189
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
Because it's always something.Like with Monica's new job...

190
00:09:28 --> 00:09:32
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

191
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
I don't want my birthday to bethe source of any kind of negative...

192
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
There's gonna be a hoopla?

193
00:09:39 --> 00:09:43
Basically there's the thing,and then the stuff after the thing...

194
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
If it makes anybody feel better,forget the thing...

195
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
...and we'll just do the gift.

196
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

197
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
No, we were gonna go seeHootie and the Blowfish.

198
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
Hootie and the...

199
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
I can catch them on the radio.

200
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
No. Now I feel bad.You wanna go to the concert.

201
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
No, look. It's my birthday...

202
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
...and the important thingis that we're all together.

203
00:10:05 --> 00:10:05
- All of us.- Together.

204
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
Not at the concert.

205
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
Thank you.

206
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
So, the Ebola virus.That's gotta suck, huh?

207
00:10:23 --> 00:10:24
Gee, Monica.What's in the bag?

208
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
I don't know, Chandler.Let's take a look.

209
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
Oh, it's like a skit.

210
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
Why, it's dinner for six.Five steaks...

211
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

212
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
We switched suppliers at work, andthey gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

213
00:10:39 --> 00:10:44
But wait, there's more.Chandler, what is in that envelope?

214
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
By the way, this didn'tseem so dorky out in the hall.

215
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
Why, it's six tickets toHootie and the Blowfish!

216
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
The Blowfish!

217
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
It's on us. So don't worry.This is...

218
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
...our treat.

219
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
Thank you.

220
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
Could you be less enthused?

221
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

222
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
But it just feels like...

223
00:11:08 --> 00:11:09
Like?

224
00:11:09 --> 00:11:10
Charity.

225
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
Charity?

226
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
We're just tryingto do a nice thing here.

227
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
But you have to understand, your"nice thing" makes us feel about this big.

228
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

229
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
I don't understand.We can't win with you guys.

230
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
If you guys feel this big,maybe that's not our fault.

231
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
Maybe that's just how you feel.

232
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
Now you're telling us how we feel.

233
00:11:33 --> 00:11:34
We never should have talked about this.

234
00:11:35 --> 00:11:36
I'm gonna pass on the concert.

235
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
I'm just not in a very"Hootie" place right now.

236
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
- Me neither.- Me too.

237
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
Guys, we bought the tickets.

238
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
Then you'll have extra seatsfor all your tiaras and stuff.

239
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
Why did you look at mewhen you said that?

240
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
So I guess now we can't go.

241
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
Do what you want. Do we alwayshave to do everything together?

242
00:12:00 --> 00:12:01
You know what? You're right.

243
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
Fine.

244
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
All right.

245
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
We're gonna go.

246
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
It's not for another six hours.We're gonna go then.

247
00:12:25 --> 00:12:26
Are you ready?

248
00:12:26 --> 00:12:30
Just let me grab my jacketand tell you I had sex today.

249
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
What? You had sex today?

250
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
It sounds even coolerwhen somebody else says it!

251
00:12:36 --> 00:12:41
I was awesome. She was biting her lipto stop from screaming.

252
00:12:41 --> 00:12:45
I know it's been a while,but I took that as a good sign.

253
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
Still doing the screening?

254
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
I had sex today.

255
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
I never have toanswer that phone again.

256
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
you know what to do.

257
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
Hey, Bob. It's Jade.

258
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
when you didn't show up yesterday.

259
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
I ended up meeting a guy.

260
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
Bob here.

261
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
So you met someone, huh?

262
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
Yes, I did.

263
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
with him two hours ago.

264
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
So how was he?

265
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
compared to you.

266
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
screaming your name.

267
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
Well, that makes me feel so good.

268
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

269
00:13:42 --> 00:13:46
Maybe he had some kind of new stylethat you're not familiar with.

270
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
You have to get used to it.

271
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49
to get used to it...

272
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
... if you know what I mean.

273
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
You know what? I'm not gonnabe able to enjoy this.

274
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
I know. It's my birthday.We all should be here.

275
00:14:05 --> 00:14:07
So let's go.

276
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
Well, maybe we should stayfor one song.

277
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
It would be rude to themfor us to leave now.

278
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
The guys are probablyhaving a great time.

279
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
Come on, you guys.One more time.

280
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
One.

281
00:14:34 --> 00:14:35
- Amazing!- Excellent!

282
00:14:35 --> 00:14:36
I can't believe the guys missed it!

283
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
What guys?Oh, yeah.

284
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
Excuse me.Aren't you Monica Geller?

285
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
- Do I know you?- You were my baby-sitter!

286
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
Oh, my God!Little Stevie Fisher?

287
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
How have you been?

288
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
Good. I'm a lawyer now.

289
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
You can't be a lawyer.You're 8.

290
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
It was nice to see you.I gotta run backstage.

291
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
Wait, backstage?

292
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
My firm represents the band.

293
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
You guys wanna meet the group?

294
00:15:02 --> 00:15:02
Come on.

295
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
Are you one of the onesthat fooled around with my Dad?

296
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
Hey, you guys!

297
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
Happy birthday!

298
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
Oh, thank you.

299
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
How was your night last night?

300
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.How was yours?

301
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
Ours pretty much sucked too.

302
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
But I ran into Stevie Fisher.Remember him?

303
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
Oh, yeah!I used to baby-sit him.

304
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
Hey, how's his dad?

305
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
Good.

306
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
Aside from that, the eveningwas pretty much a bust.

307
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

308
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
Yeah, we were just saying,this whole thing is so stupid.

309
00:15:38 --> 00:15:42
We just have to really, reallynot let stuff like money, get like...

310
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
Is that a hickey?

311
00:15:45 --> 00:15:46
Oh, no, I just...

312
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
I fell down.

313
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
On someone's lips?

314
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
Where'd you get the hickey?

315
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
You know, a party or...

316
00:15:55 --> 00:15:56
What party?

317
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
It wasn't a partyso much as a...

318
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
...a gathering of people.

319
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
With food and music and...

320
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
...and the band.

321
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
You partied withHootie and the Blowfish?

322
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootieare like this.

323
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
Who gave you that hickey?

324
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

325
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
I can't believe it!I can't believe this!

326
00:16:19 --> 00:16:24
We're just sitting at home,trying to guess Joey's fingers...

327
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
...and you're partyingand having fun and all:

328
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!"

329
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
Don't blame us.You could've been there.

330
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
What? As part of your"poor friends outreach program"?

331
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
Oh, great. It's work.

332
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
I don't know what to say.I'm sorry we make more than you.

333
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
But we're not gonna feel guilty.We work really hard.

334
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
And we don't work hard?

335
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
It's Monica. I got a page.

336
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
It's just that sometimes we liketo do stuff that costs a little more.

337
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
And you feel like we hold you back.

338
00:16:58 --> 00:16:58
Leon, wait.

339
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
Guys!

340
00:17:00 --> 00:17:01
I don't understand.

341
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
The steaks were a giftfrom the meat vendor.

342
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
That was not a kickback.

343
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
I'll just replace them,and we can forget the whole thing.

344
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
What corporate policy?

345
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
I just got fired.

346
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
Here's your check. That'll be $4,12.

347
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
Let me get that.

348
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
You got 5 bucks?

349
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
You know what to do.

350
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
Hi, it's me.

351
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
I'm probably way out of line here.

352
00:17:53 --> 00:17:57
probably seeing someone else now...

353
00:17:57 --> 00:18:00
together, for old time's sake...

354
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
One hot, steamy, wild night...
