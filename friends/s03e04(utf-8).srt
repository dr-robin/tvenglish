00:00:11.98,00:00:14.21

25

00:00:14.94,00:00:18.06

26

This ever happen to you?[br]You go to get a glass of milk...

27



28

00:00:18.30,00:00:21.46

29

...but these cartons are so[br]flinging, flanging hard to open!

30



31

00:00:21.66,00:00:23.46

32

Boy, you said it, Mike.

33



34

00:00:25.98,00:00:29.22

35

-There's gotta be a better way.[br]-There is, Kevin!

36



37

00:00:29.66,00:00:32.78

38

-Can we please turn this off?[br]-No way, Kevin!

39



40

00:00:32.98,00:00:36.45

41

What if I told you there's[br]a new product that guarantees...

42



43

00:00:36.70,00:00:39.46

44

... you'll never have to open up[br]milk cartons again?

45



46

00:00:39.70,00:00:41.82

47

Meet the Milkmaster 2000!

48



49

00:00:43.98,00:00:46.54

50

-Intrigued?[br]-You' re flinging, flanging right I am!

51



52

00:00:48.22,00:00:52.54

53

This is the first time he's used this.[br]You'll see how easy this is to do.

54



55

00:00:53.38,00:00:56.34

56

-This works in any milk carton.[br]-Wow, it is easy!

57



58

00:00:56.54,00:00:58.82

67

00:01:50.30,00:01:52.61

68

It's official.[br]There are no good movies.

69



70

00:01:52.82,00:01:55.29

71

So let's go to a bad one,[br]and make out.

72



73

00:01:59.42,00:02:03.82

74

Perhaps you'd like me to turn[br]so you can bunny-bump against my back?

75



76

00:02:06.82,00:02:09.62

77

-Hey, man. What's up?[br]-Maybe you can tell me.

78



79

00:02:09.86,00:02:13.33

80

My agent wants to know why I didn't[br]show up at my audition today. . .

81



82

00:02:13.58,00:02:17.02

83

. . .my first good one in weeks.[br]How could you not give me the message?

84



85

00:02:17.22,00:02:19.78

86

I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt. . .

87



88

00:02:20.30,00:02:21.94

89

. . .but it wasn't me.

90



91

00:02:22.18,00:02:24.02

92

Yes, it was.[br]It was him!

93



94

00:02:25.86,00:02:27.18

95

Okay, it was me!

96



97

00:02:29.26,00:02:32.46

98

-How was it you?[br]-Well, it was all so crazy, you know?

99



100

00:02:32.70,00:02:35.46

101

Chandler was in the closet,[br]counting to 1 0. . .

102



103

00:02:35.70,00:02:37.66

104

. . .and I hadn't found a place[br]to hide yet.

105



106

00:02:39.10,00:02:43.22

107

I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all[br]down on my hand. See? All of it.

108



109

00:02:43.66,00:02:45.42

110

Yep, that's my audition.

111



112

00:02:45.70,00:02:48.42

113

See? Now, this is why I keep[br]notepads everywhere.

114



115

00:02:48.62,00:02:51.42

116

Yep. And that's why we don't[br]invite you to play.

117



118

00:02:52.46,00:02:55.82

119

What is the great tragedy here?[br]Get yourself another appointment.

120



121

00:02:56.06,00:02:59.85

122

Estelle tried. The casting director[br]told her I missed my chance.

123



124

00:03:00.10,00:03:01.25

125

Well, that is unfair!

126



127

00:03:01.66,00:03:04.02

128

I'll call her.[br]I'll tell her it was my fault.

129



130

00:03:04.22,00:03:07.02

131

You can't. The casting director[br]doesn't talk to friends.

132



133

00:03:07.22,00:03:10.38

134

-She only talks to agents.[br]-What a sad little life she must lead.

135



136

00:03:13.90,00:03:16.62

137

-What are you doing?[br]-No, I know, I know.

138



139

00:03:17.86,00:03:21.14

140

Hi, this is Caitlin[br]from Phoebe Buffay's office.

141



142

00:03:22.18,00:03:24.65

143

Is Anne there for Phoebe?

144



145

00:03:25.06,00:03:27.10

146

She'll know what it's about.

147



148

00:03:27.30,00:03:28.70

149

Hang up. Hang up right--

150



151

00:03:30.62,00:03:34.06

152

Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got[br]a problem with Joey Tribbiani.

153



154

00:03:34.30,00:03:37.61

155

Apparently, he missed his audition.[br]Who did you speak to in my office?

156



157

00:03:37.86,00:03:39.93

158

Estelle? I don't know[br]what to do with her.

159



160

00:03:40.18,00:03:44.30

161

So your husband leaves and burns down[br]the apartment. The world doesn't stop.

162



163

00:03:45.42,00:03:46.94

164

Is anybody else scared?

165



166

00:03:48.46,00:03:52.22

167

If Joey loses this audition, then[br]that is it for Estelle. I don't care!

168



169

00:03:53.18,00:03:56.86

170

Annie, you are a doll. What time can[br]you see him? I need a pen. Pen!

171



172

00:04:03.50,00:04:06.97

173

Get the woman a pad![br]Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!

174



175

00:04:07.42,00:04:09.98

176

Oh, now you want a pad.

177



178

00:04:14.62,00:04:16.46

179

Where's my boy?

180



181

00:04:16.70,00:04:18.66

182

Here's my boy!

183



184

00:04:18.90,00:04:21.74

185

And here's his Barbie!

186



187

00:04:27.66,00:04:29.54

188

What's my boy doing with a Barbie?

189



190

00:04:30.58,00:04:33.05

191

He picked it out at the store.[br]He loves it.

192



193

00:04:33.30,00:04:35.74

194

He carries it everywhere,[br]like a security blanket.

195



196

00:04:35.98,00:04:38.58

197

But with ski boots and a kicky beret.

198



199

00:04:39.78,00:04:41.42

200

Yeah, it's cute.

201



202

00:04:41.62,00:04:44.46

203

Why does he have it again?

204



205

00:04:44.70,00:04:46.77

206

So he's got a doll. So what?

207



208

00:04:48.30,00:04:51.66

209

Unless you' re afraid[br]he's gonna grow up to be. . .

210



211

00:04:51.90,00:04:53.46

212

. . .in show business.

213



214

00:04:54.06,00:04:55.94

215

This wouldn't have[br]to do with the fact. . .

216



217

00:04:56.18,00:04:58.22

218

. . .that he's being raised[br]by two women?

219



220

00:04:59.58,00:05:04.26

221

You know what? It's fine. If you' re[br]okay with the Barbie thing, so am l.

222



223

00:05:04.50,00:05:07.62

224

Give Daddy the Barbie.[br]Give me the Barbie.

225



226

00:05:07.82,00:05:10.82

227

Don't you wanna play[br]with a monster truck?

228



229

00:05:12.10,00:05:13.33

230

No? Okay.

231



232

00:05:13.90,00:05:16.70

233

How about a Dino-Soldier?

234



235

00:05:21.62,00:05:22.90

236

You are so pathetic.

237



238

00:05:23.14,00:05:26.22

239

Why can't your son[br]just play with his doll?

240



241

00:05:32.50,00:05:34.10

242

I gotta go to work.

243



244

00:05:35.70,00:05:37.34

245

Has anybody seen my left boob?

246



247

00:05:39.26,00:05:40.78

248

I loved that movie.

249



250

00:05:44.78,00:05:46.74

251

Here it is.[br]What are you doing?

252



253

00:05:47.46,00:05:49.50

254

I' m sorry. It just felt nice.

255



256

00:05:53.30,00:05:54.45

257

Answer the phone.

258



259

00:05:54.82,00:05:58.26

260

I only got one arm. You should[br]do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.

261



262

00:05:59.70,00:06:01.22

263

Just do it! It's Janice.

264



265

00:06:01.46,00:06:03.82

266

And if I get it, I'll have[br]to see her tonight.

267



268

00:06:05.90,00:06:08.13

269

That's great.[br]I'll have to see her tonight.

270



271

00:06:08.38,00:06:10.50

272

Why don't you want to see Janice?

273



274

00:06:10.74,00:06:12.81

275

Last night at dinner,[br]when the meals came. . .

276



277

00:06:13.06,00:06:17.62

278

. . .she put half her chicken piccata[br]on my plate and took all my tomatoes.

279



280

00:06:19.46,00:06:21.38

281

And that's bad. . .

282



283

00:06:21.66,00:06:23.86

284

. . .because you hate chicken piccata?

285



286

00:06:25.78,00:06:29.62

287

You didn't want to share your tomatoes.[br]Tomatoes are very important to you.

288



289

00:06:30.18,00:06:32.02

290

Suddenly, we were this "couple. "

291



292

00:06:32.22,00:06:34.66

293

And this alarm started going off[br]in my head.

294



295

00:06:34.90,00:06:36.97

296

"Run for your life![br]Get out of the building! "

297



298

00:06:38.42,00:06:40.10

299

Men are unbelievable.

300



301

00:06:40.34,00:06:41.82

302

What is it with you people?

303



304

00:06:42.06,00:06:44.90

305

The minute you feel something,[br]you have to run away?

306



307

00:06:45.38,00:06:46.61

308

I know. That--

309



310

00:06:48.46,00:06:52.74

311

That's why I don't want to go tonight.[br]I' m afraid I'll say something stupid.

312



313

00:06:52.94,00:06:56.02

314

You mean that "guy thing" where[br]you act mean and distant. . .

315



316

00:06:56.22,00:06:57.86

317

. . .until we break up with you?

318



319

00:06:58.14,00:06:59.29

320

You know about that?

321



322

00:07:01.10,00:07:02.62

323

What do I do?[br]I wanna get past this.

324



325

00:07:02.86,00:07:05.01

326

I don't want to be afraid[br]of commitment.

327



328

00:07:05.26,00:07:08.62

329

I want to go through the tunnel[br]to the other side!

330



331

00:07:09.58,00:07:11.78

332

Where there's no fear of commitment.

333



334

00:07:12.90,00:07:14.18

335

Do we have any--

336



337

00:07:18.90,00:07:20.38

338

Do we have any thoughts here?

339



340

00:07:20.90,00:07:23.26

341

I've never been through[br]the tunnel myself because. . .

342



343

00:07:23.50,00:07:26.78

344

. . .you' re not allowed through[br]with more than one girl in the car.

345



346

00:07:28.98,00:07:33.06

347

But it seems to me it's pretty much[br]like anything else. Face your fear.

348



349

00:07:33.30,00:07:36.06

350

Fear of heights?[br]Go to the top of the building.

351



352

00:07:36.30,00:07:37.62

353

You' re afraid of bugs.

354



355

00:07:38.82,00:07:40.05

356

Get a bug.

357



358

00:07:42.74,00:07:44.42

359

You have a fear of commitment.

360



361

00:07:44.62,00:07:48.86

362

So I say you go in there and you be[br]the most committed guy there ever was!

363



364

00:07:49.10,00:07:51.25

365

Amazingly, that makes sense.

366



367

00:07:52.10,00:07:54.94

368

-Do you think?[br]-Oh, yeah! Go for it, man!

369



370

00:07:55.18,00:07:56.25

371

Jump off the high dive!

372



373

00:07:56.50,00:08:00.02

374

Stare down the barrel of the gun![br]Pee into the wind!

375



376

00:08:01.70,00:08:04.01

377

If I' m staring down[br]the barrel of a gun. . .

378



379

00:08:04.22,00:08:06.98

380

. . .I' m gonna be pretty much peeing[br]every which way.

381



382

00:08:12.22,00:08:14.45

383

It's your audition from this morning!

384



385

00:08:14.98,00:08:16.02

386

Can I use the phone?

387



388

00:08:16.26,00:08:20.62

389

Sure, that's what it's there for.[br]Emergencies and pretend agents.

390



391

00:08:21.66,00:08:23.10

392

Come on, baby! Come on!

393



394

00:08:25.10,00:08:27.94

395

Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay[br]returning a page.

396



397

00:08:28.18,00:08:31.54

398

Okay, she's in her car.[br]I'll have to patch you through.

399



400

00:08:31.78,00:08:33.38

401

very nice touch.

402



403

00:08:34.70,00:08:35.90

404

Okay, go ahead.

405



406

00:08:37.38,00:08:38.53

407

Talk, talk, talk!

408



409

00:08:39.90,00:08:40.94

410

Hi, Annie?

411



412

00:08:41.50,00:08:42.73

413

Fantastic. You got it!

414



415

00:08:45.58,00:08:49.90

416

Will he work for scale, you ask me?[br]Well, I don't know about that.

417



418

00:08:50.14,00:08:52.02

419

Except that I do and he will.

420



421

00:08:52.70,00:08:54.98

422

Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.

423



424

00:08:55.30,00:08:57.34

425

I would love to have lunch with you!

426



427

00:08:57.62,00:09:00.34

428

How about we have lunch next--

429



430

00:09:00.58,00:09:02.02

431

Went through a tunnel.

432



433

00:09:02.70,00:09:03.66

434

Unbelievable.

435



436

00:09:03.90,00:09:05.58

437

Oh, thank you so much!

438



439

00:09:06.02,00:09:10.06

440

It was really fun. I mean, I've never[br]talked on a car phone before.

441



442

00:09:10.90,00:09:13.62

443

You are so amazing![br]Could you do me this huge favor?

444



445

00:09:13.86,00:09:17.22

446

There's another audition I want,[br]and Estelle couldn't get me in.

447



448

00:09:17.46,00:09:19.82

449

I don't know.[br]It was fun one time, but--

450



451

00:09:20.06,00:09:22.34

452

Please? It would just be[br]this one more.

453



454

00:09:22.58,00:09:23.94

455

Well, actually it's two.

456



457

00:09:24.18,00:09:25.22

458

Two?

459



460

00:09:25.46,00:09:26.90

461

Well, really it's three.

462



463

00:09:27.30,00:09:30.61

464

Please? You' re so good at it.[br]I love you.

465



466

00:09:31.70,00:09:33.46

467

Okay. But just these three, right?

468



469

00:09:33.70,00:09:34.93

470

No, it's four.

471



472

00:09:39.22,00:09:41.26

473

So how come you wanted[br]to eat in tonight?

474



475

00:09:42.02,00:09:44.02

476

Because I wanted. . .

477



478

00:09:44.22,00:09:45.74

479

. . .to give you this.

480



481

00:09:47.22,00:09:49.66

482

Are you a puppy!

483



484

00:09:54.10,00:09:55.42

485

Contact paper!

486



487

00:09:57.02,00:09:59.62

488

What do you say when someone[br]you' re sleeping with. . .

489



490

00:09:59.82,00:10:01.54

491

. . .gives you contact paper?

492



493

00:10:02.22,00:10:06.34

494

Wait, there's more.[br]See, the contact paper is to go. . .

495



496

00:10:06.58,00:10:08.62

497

. . .in your brand new drawer!

498



499

00:10:11.22,00:10:13.45

500

See, the drawer actually[br]goes in my dresser.

501



502

00:10:14.42,00:10:17.02

503

You didn't have to do this.

504



505

00:10:17.50,00:10:18.57

506

Yes, I did.

507



508

00:10:18.78,00:10:21.14

509

Yes, I did.[br]Because you' re my girlfriend. . .

510



511

00:10:21.38,00:10:24.10

512

. . .and that's what girlfriends[br]should get.

513



514

00:10:26.10,00:10:28.49

515

Well, I gotta buy a vowel. . .

516



517

00:10:30.10,00:10:32.62

518

. . .because, oh, my God!

519



520

00:10:33.82,00:10:35.89

521

Who would've thought that someday. . .

522



523

00:10:36.10,00:10:39.02

524

. . .Chandler Bing would buy me[br]a drawer?

525



526

00:10:40.38,00:10:41.42

527

Well, not me.

528



529

00:10:43.26,00:10:46.38

530

But that's what's happened.[br]And there's more.

531



532

00:10:48.30,00:10:49.94

533

We should take a trip.

534



535

00:10:50.66,00:10:51.65

536

We should?

537



538

00:10:51.90,00:10:54.37

539

We' re a couple,[br]and that's what couples do.

540



541

00:10:55.06,00:10:56.94

542

And I wanna meet your parents.

543



544

00:10:57.18,00:10:59.90

545

We should take a trip[br]with your parents!

546



547

00:11:03.86,00:11:08.22

548

I don't think we need to because[br]you' re tripping me out right now!

549



550

00:11:09.18,00:11:10.25

551

Are you okay?

552



553

00:11:10.50,00:11:11.30

554

No, I am.

555



556

00:11:11.98,00:11:13.82

557

I actually am! This is amazing.

558



559

00:11:14.02,00:11:17.14

560

My entire life, I have feared[br]this place.

561



562

00:11:17.38,00:11:19.85

563

And now that I' m here, it's like,[br]what was the big deal?

564



565

00:11:20.10,00:11:23.86

566

I could probably say, "Let's move in[br]together," and I'd be okay.

567



568

00:11:24.30,00:11:26.53

569

You probably want us[br]to move in together?

570



571

00:11:27.70,00:11:30.74

572

-It doesn't scare me![br]-Yeah, well it scares me!

573



574

00:11:30.98,00:11:34.66

575

I' m not even divorced yet! You just[br]invited me over here for pasta. . .

576



577

00:11:34.90,00:11:37.82

578

. . .and now you' re talking[br]about moving in together.

579



580

00:11:38.06,00:11:39.86

581

And I wasn't even that hungry.

582



583

00:11:40.10,00:11:43.86

584

You know what? It's getting really[br]late, and I should just--

585



586

00:11:44.10,00:11:46.86

587

Don't go! I've scared you![br]I've said too much!

588



589

00:11:47.10,00:11:50.02

590

I' m hopeless and awkward[br]and desperate for love!

591



592

00:11:56.86,00:11:58.54

593

Hey, Janice, it's me.

594



595

00:11:59.98,00:12:03.74

596

I wanted to apologize in advance[br]for having chased you down the street.

597



598

00:12:10.66,00:12:12.81

599

Here you go, honey. This will help.

600



601

00:12:13.62,00:12:15.54

602

So I catch up to her[br]and she says. . .

603



604

00:12:15.78,00:12:19.09

605

. . .this relationship's going too fast[br]and we have to slow down.

606



607

00:12:19.30,00:12:20.86

608

That is never good.

609



610

00:12:21.06,00:12:22.34

611

Then I got all. . .

612



613

00:12:23.26,00:12:24.66

614

. . .needy and clingy.

615



616

00:12:25.46,00:12:29.09

617

Wait a minute. Maybe it's[br]not so bad. How did you leave it?

618



619

00:12:29.34,00:12:31.26

620

She said she'd call me.

621



622

00:12:33.46,00:12:34.78

623

Oh, God.

624



625

00:12:35.30,00:12:37.37

626

Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

627



628

00:12:38.62,00:12:40.82

629

This ice cream tastes like crap,[br]by the way.

630



631

00:12:41.02,00:12:44.41

632

Well, it's that[br]low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.

633



634

00:12:44.62,00:12:47.46

635

We save the real stuff[br]for the truly terminal cases.

636



637

00:12:48.22,00:12:51.69

638

When you' re getting screwed over all[br]the time, you gotta switch to low fat.

639



640

00:12:51.94,00:12:53.01

641

Yeah, you do.

642



643

00:12:53.90,00:12:56.42

644

You don't think I' m terminal?

645



646

00:12:56.62,00:13:00.22

647

Not at all. You' re not terminal.[br]We just need some damage control.

648



649

00:13:00.42,00:13:02.22

650

Okay. Should I call her?

651



652

00:13:05.06,00:13:08.45

653

It's a critical time. If you feel[br]yourself reaching for that phone. . .

654



655

00:13:08.70,00:13:11.01

656

. . .go shopping, get your butt[br]in a bubble bath.

657



658

00:13:11.22,00:13:14.69

659

If you want her back,[br]you have got to start acting aloof.

660



661

00:13:14.94,00:13:16.86

662

She has to know you' re not needy.

663



664

00:13:17.06,00:13:18.66

665

So what you have to do is. . .

666



667

00:13:18.90,00:13:21.70

668

. . .you have to accidentally[br]run into her on purpose. . .

669



670

00:13:21.90,00:13:23.66

671

. . .and then act aloof.

672



673

00:13:25.26,00:13:27.22

674

So I' m not gonna lose her?

675



676

00:13:27.94,00:13:30.38

677

Oh, honey, you' re not a total loser.

678



679

00:13:33.82,00:13:35.89

680

I said, "So I' m not gonna lose her?"

681



682

00:13:43.46,00:13:44.45

683

Guess who's here!

684



685

00:13:44.70,00:13:47.54

686

It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!

687



688

00:13:47.78,00:13:51.54

689

Real American hero[br]I'm G.I. Joe!

690



691

00:13:51.78,00:13:54.17

692

Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

693



694

00:13:54.38,00:13:55.70

695

G.I. Joe?

696



697

00:13:55.94,00:13:57.78

698

You really think he'll fall for that?

699



700

00:13:59.02,00:13:59.98

701

G.I. Joe?

702



703

00:14:00.18,00:14:01.30

704

Cool! Can I play?

705



706

00:14:03.90,00:14:07.45

707

Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects[br]U.S. oil interests overseas!

708



709

00:14:07.70,00:14:08.85

710

Go, Joe!

711



712

00:14:12.26,00:14:14.30

713

-There you are![br]-No, it's not. Sorry.

714



715

00:14:14.54,00:14:17.14

716

But, Phoebe, wait, wait.[br]Phoebe!

717



718

00:14:17.38,00:14:20.26

719

Oh, Joey! Oh, okay![br]See, I didn't recognize you. . .

720



721

00:14:20.50,00:14:21.98

722

. . .in those pants.

723



724

00:14:23.82,00:14:26.13

725

That Tv movie I went in for,[br]did you hear anything?

726



727

00:14:26.38,00:14:27.94

728

I think I got a shot at it.

729



730

00:14:28.18,00:14:30.62

731

Yes, they called![br]You didn't get it!

732



733

00:14:31.02,00:14:34.65

734

Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.[br]I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

735



736

00:14:34.90,00:14:37.21

737

That's okay. These things happen.

738



739

00:14:37.46,00:14:40.18

740

But they shouldn't happen.[br]You know what?

741



742

00:14:40.42,00:14:42.42

743

You' re in a terrible,[br]terrible business.

744



745

00:14:43.62,00:14:47.01

746

I don't want to be the person[br]who makes you look like that.

747



748

00:14:47.22,00:14:49.18

749

I' m okay. See?

750



751

00:14:50.90,00:14:53.18

752

Now you' re sad and creepy.

753



754

00:14:53.70,00:14:55.18

755

I' m sorry. I quit.

756



757

00:14:55.90,00:14:59.53

758

No, no, you can't quit![br]You' re the best agent I ever had.

759



760

00:14:59.82,00:15:03.10

761

Rejection is part of being an actor.[br]You can't take it personal.

762



763

00:15:03.34,00:15:07.74

764

They said they'd never met an ltalian[br]actor with a worse ltalian accent.

765



766

00:15:08.30,00:15:09.78

767

They actually said that?

768



769

00:15:09.98,00:15:13.74

770

Oh, God, there's that face again.[br]See? I can't do this job!

771



772

00:15:13.98,00:15:16.02

773

This is why[br]you have to do this job!

774



775

00:15:16.26,00:15:17.41

776

Agents always lie.

777



778

00:15:17.62,00:15:20.46

779

Estelle just says stuff like,[br]"They went another way. "

780



781

00:15:20.70,00:15:22.42

782

But this? I can use this.

783



784

00:15:22.62,00:15:25.34

785

I can work on a new accent.

786



787

00:15:26.30,00:15:29.30

788

Yeah, okay. If it[br]helps you, okay. Yeah.

789



790

00:15:29.54,00:15:31.82

791

You'll never get me, Joe!

792



793

00:15:45.30,00:15:46.58

794

No, thank you.

795



796

00:15:55.30,00:15:56.98

797

What are you doing here?

798



799

00:15:57.62,00:15:59.26

800

Just a bit of shopping.

801



802

00:15:59.50,00:16:00.73

803

How have you been?

804



805

00:16:02.30,00:16:04.26

806

Are you being British?

807



808

00:16:06.46,00:16:07.69

809

Not anymore.

810



811

00:16:08.82,00:16:11.82

812

Why are you shopping here?[br]You don't live in this neighborhood.

813



814

00:16:12.18,00:16:14.46

815

Were you here waiting for me?

816



817

00:16:18.10,00:16:19.01

818

I' m just. . .

819



820

00:16:19.66,00:16:22.22

821

. . .picking up some things for a party.

822



823

00:16:24.10,00:16:25.14

824

Barley?

825



826

00:16:25.94,00:16:27.90

827

What kind of party serves barley?

828



829

00:16:28.14,00:16:31.10

830

I' m sorry if my friends aren't[br]as sophisticated as yours.

831



832

00:16:32.66,00:16:33.89

833

Where is this party?

834



835

00:16:34.14,00:16:34.94

836

Here in Chelsea.

837



838

00:16:35.46,00:16:36.82

839

Whose party is it?

840



841

00:16:37.02,00:16:38.14

842

A woman's.

843



844

00:16:38.38,00:16:39.26

845

What woman?

846



847

00:16:40.70,00:16:41.77

848

Chelsea.

849



850

00:16:43.74,00:16:46.82

851

Either you' re seeing somebody[br]behind my back. . .

852



853

00:16:47.02,00:16:49.58

854

. . .which would make you[br]the world's biggest jerk. . .

855



856

00:16:49.78,00:16:52.01

857

. . .or you' re pretending[br]to see somebody. . .

858



859

00:16:52.26,00:16:55.54

860

. . .which makes you so pathetic[br]I could cry right here!

861



862

00:16:55.78,00:16:59.22

863

So which of these two guys[br]do you want to be?

864



865

00:17:00.22,00:17:01.90

866

Can I be that guy?

867



868

00:17:04.42,00:17:08.62

869

Okay, we got some more good[br]rejections. Lots of stuff to work on.

870



871

00:17:09.62,00:17:10.61

872

Okay. Shoot.

873



874

00:17:10.86,00:17:13.46

875

Okay. Oh, the zoo commercial.

876



877

00:17:13.70,00:17:14.66

878

I didn't get it?

879



880

00:17:14.90,00:17:18.61

881

They said that you[br]"weren't believable as a human being. "

882



883

00:17:19.70,00:17:21.66

884

So you can work on that.

885



886

00:17:22.70,00:17:23.58

887

Great.

888



889

00:17:24.06,00:17:24.97

890

What else?

891



892

00:17:25.18,00:17:28.62

893

The off-Broadway-play people said[br]that you were "pretty but dumb. "

894



895

00:17:29.22,00:17:31.61

896

Oh, no wait. I' m sorry.[br]That's "pretty dumb. "

897



898

00:17:32.30,00:17:34.42

899

Look, it's okay, no, no, no.[br]Really.

900



901

00:17:34.66,00:17:35.65

902

Look. . .

903



904

00:17:36.02,00:17:38.09

905

. . .I really appreciate this. . .

906



907

00:17:38.90,00:17:41.02

908

. . .but I' m gonna have to[br]go back to Estelle.

909



910

00:17:41.90,00:17:44.74

911

Don't get me wrong.[br]You' re a better agent than she is. . .

912



913

00:17:44.98,00:17:48.53

914

. . .but at least with her, I don't want[br]to blow my pretty dumb brains out.

915



916

00:17:49.78,00:17:51.62

917

Yeah, no, I understand.

918



919

00:17:51.82,00:17:53.30

920

You do? Thanks. Okay.

921



922

00:17:53.62,00:17:54.45

923

Sorry.

924



925

00:17:58.26,00:17:59.33

926

Wait a minute.

927



928

00:17:59.58,00:18:00.78

929

Wait a minute.

930



931

00:18:00.98,00:18:04.22

932

Did you make all that stuff up[br]to get out of being my agent?

933



934

00:18:04.46,00:18:05.78

935

Oh, he caught me.

936



937

00:18:08.06,00:18:09.74

938

I am so busted!

939



940

00:18:10.82,00:18:12.97

941

That's what I suspected!

942



943

00:18:16.38,00:18:18.22

944

And then I just, you know. . .

945



946

00:18:19.02,00:18:22.22

947

. . .threw the bag of barley at her[br]and ran out of the store.

948



949

00:18:22.78,00:18:26.41

950

My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof,"[br]not "a doof. "

951



952

00:18:27.98,00:18:30.74

953

I've actually ruined this, haven't l?

954



955

00:18:32.18,00:18:34.18

956

Is it time for the good ice cream now?

957



958

00:18:34.86,00:18:36.18

959

Yeah, it is.

960



961

00:18:36.78,00:18:39.86

962

You know what?[br]Everything's gonna be okay.

963



964

00:18:46.58,00:18:48.62

965

Can you hold on for a second?

966



967

00:18:50.18,00:18:51.22

968

What do I do?

969



970

00:18:51.42,00:18:53.26

971

I don't know.[br]This is unprecedented.

972



973

00:18:53.50,00:18:55.97

974

If we did what you did,[br]a man would never call.

975



976

00:18:56.86,00:19:00.22

977

I got it! Pretend you just woke up.[br]That'll throw her off!

978



979

00:19:00.42,00:19:02.46

980

-Be sleepy![br]-Yes! And grumpy!

981



982

00:19:02.70,00:19:05.22

983

What are you--?[br]Stop naming dwarfs!

984



985

00:19:10.30,00:19:12.82

986

I' m so glad that you called.

987



988

00:19:13.98,00:19:18.22

989

I know I've been acting[br]really weird lately. . .

990



991

00:19:19.50,00:19:22.42

992

. . .and it's just because[br]I' m crazy about you. . .

993



994

00:19:25.10,00:19:29.06

995

. . .and I just got stupid and scared. . .

996



997

00:19:29.30,00:19:31.02

998

. . .and stupid a couple more times.

999



1000

00:19:32.30,00:19:33.21

1001

And I' m sorry.

1002



1003

00:19:34.70,00:19:35.50

1004

Really?

1005



1006

00:19:37.66,00:19:38.70

1007

Really?

1008



1009

00:19:39.74,00:19:41.86

1010

He's so lucky.[br]If Janice were a guy. . .

1011



1012

00:19:42.10,00:19:44.82

1013

. . .she'd be sleeping[br]with somebody else by now.

1014



1015

00:19:46.06,00:19:47.26

1016

I love you too.

1017



1018

00:19:47.78,00:19:49.10

1019

It's so unfair!

1020



1021

00:19:56.90,00:19:58.42

1022

G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?!

1023



1024

00:19:59.02,00:20:02.86

1025

I don't know what to tell you guys.[br]That's the doll he chose.

1026



1027

00:20:03.26,00:20:05.54

1028

What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

1029



1030

00:20:05.74,00:20:07.94

1031

Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

1032



1033

00:20:08.18,00:20:11.46

1034

And if you guys can't deal with it,[br]that's just your too bad.

1035



1036

00:20:13.34,00:20:17.13

1037

What are you being such a weenie for?[br]So he has a Barbie. Big deal.

1038



1039

00:20:17.38,00:20:19.34

1040

You used to dress up like a woman.

1041



1042

00:20:25.18,00:20:26.06

1043

What?

1044



1045

00:20:27.02,00:20:29.25

1046

The way you used to dress up[br]in Mom's clothes?

1047



1048

00:20:29.66,00:20:31.30

1049

What are you talking about?

1050



1051

00:20:31.50,00:20:34.34

1052

The big hat, the pearls,[br]the little pink handbag?

1053



1054

00:20:34.58,00:20:37.02

1055

Okay. You are totally[br]making this up.

1056



1057

00:20:37.50,00:20:39.26

1058

How can you not remember?

1059



1060

00:20:39.50,00:20:41.22

1061

You made us call you "Bea"?

1062



1063

00:20:47.62,00:20:48.66

1064

Oh, God.

1065



1066

00:20:49.82,00:20:52.70

1067

I've literally never been this happy.

1068



1069

00:20:53.38,00:20:55.42

1070

Wasn't there a little song?

1071



1072

00:20:55.62,00:20:57.62

1073

Oh, please, God,[br]let there be a song.

1074



1075

00:20:58.14,00:21:00.21

1076

There was no song.[br]There was no song.

1077



1078

00:21:00.42,00:21:01.74

1079

I am Bea

1080



1081

00:21:02.22,00:21:03.82

1082

-I drink tea--[br]-That's enough.

1083



1084

00:21:04.06,00:21:05.42

1085

Won't you....

1086



1087

00:21:06.50,00:21:07.78

1088

Won't you....

1089



1090

00:21:08.78,00:21:10.01

1091

Won't you....

1092



1093

00:21:11.58,00:21:13.94

1094

Won't you dance around with me?

1095



1096

00:21:20.46,00:21:22.77

1097

I am Bea

1098



1099

00:21:23.30,00:21:25.37

1100

I drink tea

1101



1102

00:21:25.98,00:21:30.46

1103

Won't you dance around with--?

1104



1105

00:21:40.10,00:21:41.33

1106

Ross?

1107
