00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
No, no.I wasn't waving at you, lady.

26

27
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
This hot girl in Ross' buildingis flirting with me.

28
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
Get in there, man.Flirt back. Mix it up!

29
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08

30
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
Okay, here goes.

34
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
It worked! She's waving me over.I'll be right over.

35
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
Let's see,she's on the third floor...

36
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
- She is pretty, huh?- Tell me about it.

37
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
No, no! I'm not with her.

38
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
That's just Monica.

39
00:02:45 --> 00:02:46
Hey, Joey!

40
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
Great stuff, huh?

41
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
This your place?

42
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
Yeah, of course it is.Come on in.

43
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
Go by the window.You can pretend to be surfing.

44
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
I counted.You're not supposed to live here!

45
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Oh, man!

46
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
What happened?

47
00:03:05 --> 00:03:10
I ended up at Ross' place.I must have miscounted or something.

48
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
Damn! She's not there anymore.

49
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
Look, Ross is doinghis "watching TV" bit.

50
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
No, Joe, I thinkhe's just watching TV.

51
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
with the suspect.

52
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
Okay, now I really have to go.

53
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
It's so unfair thatour date has to get cut short...

54
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
...just because some guyshot at a store clerk.

55
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
- I know, but it's my job.- Then maybe I could come too?

56
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
naked from the sewer.

57
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
All right, you go.

58
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
Oh, God!

59
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
Oh, I just miss him so much!

60
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
For just a week,you guys are close.

61
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
Yeah, it's weird.I can't help it. He's so sweet.

62
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
He's like this littlepuppy dog, you know?

63
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
But like a really tough onewho shoots bad guys.

64
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
I love the beginning partsof relationships.

65
00:04:12 --> 00:04:13
You can't keep your handsoff each other.

66
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
I know. It is the best.

67
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
How long did that lastfor you and Chandler?

68
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
What? It's still going on.

69
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
Come on, seriously.When did it end?

70
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
I am serious. We're all overeach other all the time.

71
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
Okay, you know where you arebetter than I do.

72
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
Why don't you just calm down?

73
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
Get all your facts before you telleverybody you're the only hot couple.

74
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
God, I woke the beast.

75
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
I was wrong obviously.I just misspoke. It's okay.

76
00:04:43 --> 00:04:44
It is okay.

77
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
As long as you know Chandler and Iare also hot and fiery.

78
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
Just as hot as you.

79
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
I mean, our flame...

80
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
It is on fire!

81
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
Here's your broom back.

82
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
You are so cute!

83
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
How'd the interview go?

84
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
Horrible! I did the stupidest,most embarrassing thing.

85
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
Did you say you wanted to have sexwith his wife then fall off your chair?

86
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
So what happened?

87
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
It was horrible!And the interview part went so well.

88
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
I even made him laugh.

89
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
He said something about a boat...

90
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,if you've got enough life jackets."

91
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
Trust me.It was actually very funny.

92
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Anyway, we weresaying goodbye and...

93
00:05:33 --> 00:05:33
What happened?

94
00:05:34 --> 00:05:35
We were shaking hands...

95
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
... and he leaned in toward me.

96
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
Maybe he was opening the door...

97
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
misread him and I...

98
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
You kissed him?

99
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
I didn't know what else to do!

100
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
You could have tried...

101
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
...not kissing him.

102
00:05:54 --> 00:05:55
Thanks, Chandler.

103
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
A guy from Ralph Lauren called.You got a second interview.

104
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
I can't believe it!I got a second interview.

105
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
That kiss isn't looking likesuch a mistake now, is it?

106
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
You don't think that'swhy he wants me back?

107
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
Yeah!

108
00:06:08 --> 00:06:09
No?

109
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
What are you talking about?

110
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
I accidentally kissed himin the interview...

111
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
...and now he wants me back...

112
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
...because, "Let's bring backthe girl who kisses everybody!"

113
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
Come on, Rach.

114
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
What if he thinksI'll just sleep with him?

115
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
He wants you back becauseyou're right for the job.

116
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!How could I be so stupid?

117
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
Rachel, don't say that. I thinkyou just need a hug from Joey.

118
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
Come on. Come on.

119
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
She's back! Hot girl's back!

120
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
Well, I'm not totally back yet.But I appreciate it.

121
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
No. In Ross' building.She's back!

122
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Wait there.I'll be over in a second.

123
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
One, two, three...Got it!

124
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
I gotta check out this hot girl.

125
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
There she is!

126
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
Damn it! Did you move?

127
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
Yes.

128
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
I lived with you for a while.Then I found this place.

129
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
I'm Ross.

130
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
Do you happen to havea hot girl in there?

131
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
No, I'm all alone.

132
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
Yeah. Sorry about that.

133
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
Hey, little girl.

134
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
Is your mommy or sister or babysitterby any chance, a hot girl?

135
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
Daddy!

136
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
Later, girl!

137
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Oh, man!

138
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
Hot girl?

139
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
Hot girl!

140
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
Hi, Rachel. Come on in.

141
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
- It's nice to see you again.- Thank you.

142
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
What?

143
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
Excuse me?

144
00:08:09 --> 00:08:10
Yeah, let me...

145
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
Okay, I see what's going on here.Now, look...

146
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
...I'm sorry if I gave youthe wrong impression.

147
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
But I am not some hussy who willjust sleep around to get ahead.

148
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
Even though I kissed you,that does not give you...

149
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
...the right to demand sex from me!I do not want this job that bad.

150
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
Good day, sir.

151
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
You are not gonna believe...

152
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
...what that sleazeballfrom Ralph Lauren did to me!

153
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
Okay, that's amazing!How did you know that?

154
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
You got ink on your lip.

155
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
What do you say, maybe,sometime I hold your gun?

156
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
We're not supposed to do that.

157
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
What could happen? I mean...

158
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
Yeah. I'm gonna say no.

159
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
- Do you want to see a movie tonight?- We can't. We already have plans.

160
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
What are you doing?

161
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
Well, same thing we did all day.Just hang out at Gary's apartment.

162
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
He is so amazing.We never left the bedroom.

163
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
But have fun at the movie.

164
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
Well, we're not seeing a movie.

165
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
Then why did you ask usif we wanted to go?

166
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
Because I just wantedto know what you were doing...

167
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
...so you wouldn't walk inon me and Chandler...

168
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
...while we were doing it all night.

169
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
Will you excuse me?

170
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
Chandler?Can I see you for a second?

171
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
- We have got to beat them!- Why?

172
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
Because Gary and Phoebe thinkthey're a hotter couple than us.

173
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
So?

174
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
So we've gotta go have a lot of sexand prove them wrong!

175
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
You've got to stop thiscompetitive thing. It's crazy.

176
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
Just to impress them, you want usto have sex over and over...

177
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
...and I'm saying no to this, why?Get your coat!

178
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
Excuse me.

179
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
You should check this out.Tell the other tenants.

180
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
Apparently, he's lookingfor some kind of hot girl.

181
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
Who isn't?

182
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
I don't think we've met.I'm Ross.

183
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
I know. You're the guy whowouldn't chip in for the handyman.

184
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
Never mind.

185
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
I actually thought it was unfairthe way everyone reacted.

186
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
I mean, you had just moved in.

187
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
I had just moved in!

188
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
Thank you!

189
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
Listen...

190
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
Jen.

191
00:10:51 --> 00:10:55
I know this may sound a little...

192
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
But would you want to graba cup of coffee sometime?

193
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
Sure, that would be nice.

194
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
My number's on there.Give me a call.

195
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
I will give you a call.

196
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
- I'll see you later.- Okay.

197
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
I forgot my paper.

198
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
That was amazing.

199
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
Phoebe and Gary are so gonnahear about this at dinner.

200
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
That was amazing.

201
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
We are the hottest, huh?

202
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
No one is hotter than we are.

203
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
- We're the best.- No, you're the best.

204
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
- No, you're the best.- No, you're the best.

205
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
I am the best.

206
00:11:40 --> 00:11:41
Hey, guys.

207
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
What you been doing?

208
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
Isn't that the girl who waved at you?

209
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
I don't know, but I cansee through your sheet.

210
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
Yeah, that's her.

211
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
You know, it doesn't matter.I'll never meet her.

212
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
It's impossible to find her apartment!

213
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
She lives in some hot-girlparallel universe or something.

214
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
What are you talking about?

215
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
She lives on the 2nd floor,7th apartment from the left.

216
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
No, she lives on the 3rd floor,8th apartment from the left.

217
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
No. Those first two windows,that's the lobby.

218
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
That other window is the stairway.You've been counting wrong.

219
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
I did not know that!Thank you, Monica.

220
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
I almost lost another girlbecause of counting!

221
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
- So, you ready?- Yeah, I'll just get my coat.

222
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
- Could you get that?- Sure.

223
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
No! No!

224
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
First, I would like to saythank you for seeing me again.

225
00:12:47 --> 00:12:48
That's all right.

226
00:12:48 --> 00:12:53
But I feel obligated to tell youthat this meeting is being videotaped.

227
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
Well, first, I would like to startby apologizing for kissing you...

228
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
...and for yelling at you.

229
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Fair enough.

230
00:13:03 --> 00:13:08
Now, you're probably going to hireone of the people who did not...

231
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
...yell at you and storm out.

232
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
And I think that's a big mistake.And here's why.

233
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
I made a huge fool of myself,and I came back. That shows courage.

234
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
When I thought you wanted sexin exchange for this job, I said no.

235
00:13:21 --> 00:13:22
That shows integrity.

236
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
And I was not afraidto stand up for myself...

237
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
...and that shows courage.

238
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
Now, I know that I'vealready said courage...

239
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
...but you've got to have courage.

240
00:13:34 --> 00:13:38
And finally, when I thoughtyou were making sexual advances...

241
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
...I said no,and I was not litigious.

242
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
So there you go!You got courage...

243
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
...you got integrity,you got courage again...

244
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
...and not litigious.

245
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
Look, Mr...

246
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
Zelner.

247
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
I knew that!

248
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
Oh, I knew that.

249
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
I really, really want this job.

250
00:13:57 --> 00:14:02
And I think I would bereally good at it.

251
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
You know what?

252
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
I may regret this...

253
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
...but I'll give you a shot.

254
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
You are?

255
00:14:11 --> 00:14:12
Really?

256
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
Thank you. Oh, God!

257
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
Would it be inappropriateif I gave you a hug?

258
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
Well, how about a handshake?

259
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
Oh, God! I'm sorry!

260
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
I did not mean to touch that!I mean, you!

261
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
There!

262
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
I'm gonna leave.Thank you very much.

263
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
Hey, I'll see you Monday.

264
00:14:38 --> 00:14:39
Are you tired?

265
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
You better believe he's tiredafter the day we had!

266
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
If you know what I mean.Do you know what I mean?

267
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
Honey? The tortilla chipsknow what you mean.

268
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
Do you like that badge I got you?

269
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.

270
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
Now, I gotta go.Officer Bing's got a 10-100.

271
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
That's pee-pee.

272
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.

273
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
We kind of took a detouron our way over here.

274
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
We were strolling through the parkand no one was around, so...

275
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
- You didn't.- We did!

276
00:15:13 --> 00:15:18
We violated section 12,paragraph 7 of the criminal code.

277
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
The park, huh?

278
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
Public place.

279
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
I hear you.Can you excuse me for a second?

280
00:15:34 --> 00:15:35
Hi, Chandler.

281
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
Monica, this is the men's room.

282
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
Isn't it?

283
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
Yes, it is.

284
00:15:42 --> 00:15:45
But see, I've always foundthe men's bathroom very sexual.

285
00:15:45 --> 00:15:46
Haven't you?

286
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47
No.

287
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
And if I did, I don't thinkwe'd be going out.

288
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
This is getting ridiculous.

289
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
Come on, we can't let them win!

290
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
We've proved that we are hot, okay?So why are you obsessed about this?

291
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
Phoebe and Gary are in that...

292
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
..."can't keep their handsoff each other" phase!

293
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
So?

294
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
It makes me really sad thatwe're not really there anymore.

295
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
Oh, is that whatthis has all been about?

296
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
Wasn't it a lot more excitingwhen we were...

297
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
...all over each other all the time?

298
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
Yeah, that was great.That was really great.

299
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
But the truth is, I'm moreexcited about where we are now.

300
00:16:21 --> 00:16:22
- Really?- Yeah.

301
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
I've never been in a relationshipthis long before.

302
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
To get past the beginning andstill want to be around each other?

303
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
I think that's incredible.

304
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
And the fact thatthis is happening with you...

305
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
...I think that's pretty exciting.

306
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
That's so sweet.

307
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
I know that I was actinga little crazy...

308
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
...but I feel the same way.

309
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
You know what I just realized?

310
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
You just freaked outabout our relationship.

311
00:16:53 --> 00:16:54
- I did not.- Yes, you did!

312
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
Admit it. You freaked out!

313
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
I freaked out a little.

314
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
A little?You freaked out bigtime, okay?

315
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
And I fixed it!We have switched places.

316
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
I am the relationship king, and youare the crazy, irrational screwup!

317
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
And now we're back.

318
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.

319
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
Thank God!I can't watch him anymore.

320
00:17:24 --> 00:17:25
You guys ready?

321
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
By the way, thank you forloaning us Pamela and Yasmine.

322
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
Man, they cannot get enough!
