1
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
Sorry I'm late.Did I miss anything?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreosin his mouth.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:09
Fifteen?

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Your personal best!

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
Where were you?

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
On a date.

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
I met this girl on a traingoing to a museum upstate.

8
00:00:19 --> 00:00:22
- Which museum?- How'd you meet her?

9
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
No. Answer his.

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
We were at the back of the train.

11
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
I sat near the doorso she'd have to pass by me...

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
...if she wanted to switch cars.She was totally at my mercy.

13
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
Were you so late becauseyou were burying this woman?

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
I'm late becauseshe lives in Poughkeepsie.

15
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
She seems great,but she's two and a half hours away.

16
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
How can she be greatif she's from Poughkeepsie?

17
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
That joke would have killedin Albany.

18
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
Done! I did it.

19
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
Who's stupid now?

20
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
The One with theGirl From Poughkeepsie

21
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
Look! They're lightingthe big Christmas tree tonight.

22
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
That paper is two weeks old.

23
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
Who keeps leaving old newspapersin the trash?

24
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
I really wantedto take Kathy to this.

25
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
At least you have somebodyto miss stuff with.

26
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
I hate being alonethis time of year.

27
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
Next it's Valentine's Day...

28
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
...then my birthday, then bang!

29
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
Then they're lightingthat damn tree again.

30
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
I want somebody!

31
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
You know, I want a man!

32
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
It doesn't even have to bea big relationship. Just a fling!

33
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
I didn't think girls everjust wanted a fling.

34
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
Let me tell you, it's beena long time since I've been flung.

35
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
I know what I'm giving youfor Christmas.

36
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
There are nice guys in my office.Want me to set you up?

37
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
I've been single a long time.Why haven't you offered before?

38
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
I have a girlfriend.I'm happy.

39
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
I no longer go out of my wayto stop others from being happy.

40
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
No accountants.

41
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
And no one from "legal".I don't like boring jobs.

42
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
And Ross was what?A lion tamer?

43
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
What's wrong, Mon?

44
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
Everybody at work still hates me.

45
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
I was making headway.

46
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
Everyone was smiling at me,and then I get off work...

47
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
...and find out they wrote thison my chef's hat.

48
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
Maybe they meant to write"Quiet, Bitch."

49
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
What's the matter?

50
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

51
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
I haven't been picked on this muchsince kindergarten.

52
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
And they brought in someone fromjunior high to do the see-saw with me.

53
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
They're trying to make me quit.If it were any other job, I would.

54
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
But I've waited for thismy whole life.

55
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
Wait, you're the boss.Yell at them. Or fire them!

56
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
I would love to, but I can't.I'm not good at confrontation.

57
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
You know what you can do?

58
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
I read about this director,Orson Welles...

59
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
...who, at the beginning, wouldhire somebody just to fire them.

60
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
Then they would all know who was boss.

61
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
I'm not doing anything.Why not fire me?

62
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
It's a good idea.Can you waiter?

63
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
Good enough to get fired.

64
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
All right. You're hired!

65
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
That's why I got fired last week!Does Orson Welles direct commercials?

66
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
I say, Drew?Are you seeing anybody right now?

67
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
I'm not asking for me.

68
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
I'm not gay.I'm not asking you out.

69
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
I'm not gay.

70
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
I didn't think you were gay.

71
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
I do now.

72
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
My friend, Rachel,wants to be set up.

73
00:04:31 --> 00:04:32
I just got out ofa big relationship.

74
00:04:33 --> 00:04:34
I'm not looking to get serious.

75
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
That's okay. A flingmight be all right with her.

76
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
Is this "Hot Rachel" thatyou took to the Christmas Party?

77
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
By the way, that is her full name.

78
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
Wow! I'm free for her.

79
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

80
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
Let's talk it overat the Ranger game.

81
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
Hold on.I just got a box of Cubans.

82
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
I'll bring themby your office at five.

83
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
That's a little laterthan I usually stay, but sure.

84
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
Before the game, we could enjoysome eight-year-old Basil Haydens.

85
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
I don't know what that is,but let's!

86
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.Do you want to hear it?

87
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
Happy Hanukkah, Monica

88
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey

89
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross

90
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
Spin the dreidel, Rachel

91
00:05:31 --> 00:05:32
Pheebs, that's great!

92
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
But you know,Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

93
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40
I know, but it's so hard.Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

94
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
What are you talking about?Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

95
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.

96
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
Maypole.

97
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
All good. Thanks.

98
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
Do you, maybe, have a nicknamethat's easier to rhyme?

99
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
Didn't your dad used to call you"Pumpkin"?

100
00:05:57 --> 00:06:01
But did he ever call you"Budolph"?

101
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
Hello, children.

102
00:06:04 --> 00:06:08
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

103
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
I showed them your picture.

104
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
Guys are throwing themselves at meand giving me stuff.

105
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
- Knicks tonight?- Where are the seats?

106
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
Wherever! I've got 20.

107
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
Will I like any of these guys?

108
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
You know, I'm going to...

109
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
...play the field a little bit more.

110
00:06:23 --> 00:06:27
Guys are signing overtheir 401 Ks to me.

111
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
You work with robots?

112
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

113
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
I like swimmers' bodies.

114
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
His dad made the magnetic stripon credit cards.

115
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
I like credit cards!

116
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
I'm not bad at this!

117
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
- What does he do?- He works in fine foods.

118
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
- You have a fine foods division?- It's a big company...

119
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
Now, wait a second.You make food and robots?

120
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
No, the robots just work for them.

121
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
All right, I'm going to work.

122
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
Does anybody havea problem with that?

123
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
Yeah, lady. I do!

124
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
I got a problem!

125
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
I'll give you a problem!

126
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
What will you do?Fire me?

127
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
You bet your ass I'll fire you!

128
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
See you later.

129
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
I should go.I've got a date.

130
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
With who?

131
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
You know the girlwho lives in Poughkeepsie?

132
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
Not her.

133
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
This is someone else.

134
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
I can't decide between the two.

135
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
The one from Poughkeepsie, thoughtwo hours away, is pretty...

136
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
...really smart and a lot of fun.

137
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
But this other girl,she lives right uptown.

138
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
She's just as pretty.

139
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
I guess she's smart.

140
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
She's not fun.

141
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
If she's no fun,why date her at all?

142
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
I want to give her a chance.She lives so close.

143
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
And, at the end of the date,she said something that...

144
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
...if she was kidding,was very funny.

145
00:07:59 --> 00:08:04
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.She's stupid and racist.

146
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
How was your first dayat the restaurant?

147
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
Damn!

148
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
What happened to your fancy jacket?

149
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
They baked it.

150
00:08:21 --> 00:08:21
I can't take this anymore.

151
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
- I'm going to fire you tonight.- You got it.

152
00:08:25 --> 00:08:26
What are you doing?

153
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
You're still on fire there.

154
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
I think you got it!

155
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
Chandler, you havethe best taste in men.

156
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
Like father, like son.

157
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
Patrick and I had sucha great time last night!

158
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
This could, maybe, get serious.

159
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
I thought you weren't lookingfor serious. Just a fling?

160
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
Well, you know, possibly.

161
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
You didn't tell him that,though, right?

162
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
You told this guy thatI was looking for a fling?

163
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
- You don't tell him that!- Why not?

164
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl...

165
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
I see.

166
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
You telling him I want a flingand me putting out...

167
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
...he's so going to getthe wrong idea!

168
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
Joey, could you pass the cheese?

169
00:09:20 --> 00:09:21
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.

170
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
I thought it might be funto try out a cool nickname.

171
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
Hey, Dragon!

172
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
Here's your tipsfrom Monday and Tuesday.

173
00:09:30 --> 00:09:31
There's $300 in this one.

174
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
People get generousaround the holidays.

175
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
And it never hurtsto wear tight trousers.

176
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
Could the waiters listento the specials?

177
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
There's Chilean sea basswith a mango relish...

178
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
Why is nobody writing these?

179
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
We can remember them.

180
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
Because you'll make up fake specialsand make me cook them?

181
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
Sure, that too.

182
00:09:54 --> 00:09:59
Forget the specials for a minute.Here's the thing...

183
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
For the last two weeks I have...

184
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
...tried hard to createa positive atmosphere.

185
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
Can't hear you!

186
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
Positive atmosphere.

187
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
But I've had it up to here.

188
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
From now on,it is going to be my way...

189
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
...or the highway. All right?

190
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
Does anybody havea problem with that?

191
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
Hey, new guy.

192
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
I said, does anybodyhave a problem with that?

193
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
No, ma'am.

194
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
He has a name. It's Dragon.

195
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
You want to know your name?Check your hat.

196
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
We did the hat, right?

197
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
- What the hell just happened?- I am so sorry.

198
00:10:52 --> 00:10:53
I was going to do it.

199
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
But I was standing therewith $327 in one hand...

200
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
...and $238 in the other.And I was thinking...

201
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
...it's been a long time since I had...

202
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
...$327 plus $238!

203
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
We had a deal! It's why you're here.I've got to fire you!

204
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
And I got to pay rent!

205
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
How about you don't fire me.

206
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
Instead, I stay.I gain their trust.

207
00:11:16 --> 00:11:20
They'll listen to the nice thingsI say about you.

208
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
What nice things?

209
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
Nothing yet. They hate you,and I want to fit in.

210
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
Merry, merry...

211
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
You know what, Pheebs?

212
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
I'm not Jewish so...

213
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
Ross doesn't decorate his treewith floss...

214
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
...but he's not complaining.

215
00:11:40 --> 00:11:41
Bad dream?

216
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
I wasn't sleeping.

217
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
What was Phoebe's song about?

218
00:11:46 --> 00:11:50
It's the one with the cat.

219
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
I got to go.I've got another date.

220
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
Did you pick one yet?

221
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
It turns out the onefrom uptown was making a joke.

222
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
It was a different joke.It wasn't that funny.

223
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
So I'm still torn.

224
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
You don't like the one from uptown.

225
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
And you're exhaustedfrom dating Poughkeepsie.

226
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
Just end them both!

227
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
Go to Poughkeepsieand break up with her.

228
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
Then break up with uptown.

229
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
By the time you get home,you're done!

230
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
You're right. Thank you.

231
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
I had a similar problemwhen I lived in Prague.

232
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
- Prague?- So much you don't know.

233
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
Patrick just ended things with me.

234
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
Did you or didn't you tell himI wanted a serious relationship?

235
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
I did! I absolutely did!

236
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
You idiot!

237
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
I'm sure you're right.But why?

238
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
You don't tell a guy thatyou want a serious relationship.

239
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
Now you scared him away!

240
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
I am sorry.I am so sorry.

241
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
You should never be allowedto talk to people!

242
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
I know, I know!

243
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Now I'm right back where I started.

244
00:13:03 --> 00:13:04
This sucks!

245
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
Being alone sucks!

246
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
You'll meet somebody.

247
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
You're a great catch!

248
00:13:10 --> 00:13:15
When I told those guys about you,I didn't have to lie once.

249
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
Really?

250
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
You graduated magna cum laude, right?

251
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
It doesn't matter.

252
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
I got tickets to the Ranger game.You want to come with me?

253
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
Cute guys in little shorts?

254
00:13:31 --> 00:13:32
Sure.

255
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
Actually, it's a hockey team.Angry Canadians with no teeth.

256
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
That sounds fun too.Thank you.

257
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
Have you ever been with a woman?

258
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
What is the matter with you?

259
00:13:49 --> 00:13:53
There is no good timeto ask that question.

260
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
The station is Poughkeepsie.Poughkeepsie!

261
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
Ross?

262
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
Wake up!

263
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
I need more swordfish.

264
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
- Can you get me more swordfish?- I don't speak English.

265
00:14:17 --> 00:14:18
You just did.

266
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
I don't know what to tell you.

267
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
Fine.

268
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
Very funny.

269
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
Let me out, please.

270
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
Come on, I'm cold!

271
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
And covered in marinara sauce!

272
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
Let me out!

273
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
You found that handle, did you?

274
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
- It's not funny.- Well, that's not true.

275
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
I'm a good person.And I'm a good chef.

276
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
And I don't deserve to havemarinara sauce all over me!

277
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
If you want meto quit this bad then...

278
00:15:01 --> 00:15:02
Chef Geller?

279
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
You know that speech you made?

280
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
I got a problem with it!

281
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
- You do?- You bet I do!

282
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
I just wasn't listening then,that's all.

283
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
If you want a problem,I'll give you a problem!

284
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
What are you going to do?Fire me?

285
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
You bet I'll fire you!Get out of my kitchen!

286
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
Get out!

287
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
All right.

288
00:15:30 --> 00:15:31
Anybody else got a problem?

289
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
How about you, chuckles?

290
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
You think this is funny now?

291
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
What if I dance covered in sauce?You think it's funny?

292
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
No, it's really good.

293
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
Take those salads to table four.

294
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47
And you, get the swordfish!

295
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49

00:15:52 --> 00:15:57
Last stop, Montreal.The stop is Montreal!

298
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
What?

299
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
I bet myselfthat you had beautiful eyes.

300
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
Now that I see them, I win!

301
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
We're at my stop.Would you like to have coffee?

302
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20

304
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
So coffee?

305
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
Coffee sounds great.

306
00:16:28 --> 00:16:29
Wait.

307
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
So you live in Montreal?

308
00:16:30 --> 00:16:35
