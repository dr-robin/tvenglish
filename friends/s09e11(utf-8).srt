00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
Good morning, tiger.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
I'm making you a big breakfast, so youcan keep up your strength for tonight.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
You're gonna get megood and pregnant.

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
I've got nowhere to go this morning.I'm unemployed.

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
I don't know whatI'm gonna do with my life.

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Well, I just lost my erection.

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
No, I mean, what am I supposedto do with myself?

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
You're supposed to findyour passion in life.

9
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
You can be whatever you wantto be now. It's exciting.

10
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
Yeah, but it's all so overwhelming.I don't know where to start.

11
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Wait a second.I can help you with this.

12
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
You just need to be organized. We canmake a list of your qualifications...

13
00:00:33 --> 00:00:38
...and categorize jobs by industry.There could be folders and files...

14
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
Hey, this is where your hyper-organizedpain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.

15
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
I know!

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
My erection is back!

20
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
Thank you.

21
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
Joey, could I have a sip of your coffeeand a bite of your muffin?

22
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
- Okay.- Thank you.

23
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
Thank you.

24
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
Pheebs, have you ever been bittenby a hungry Italian?

25
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
I'm sorry.It's just, I'm a little short on cash.

26
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
If you want,I could loan you some money.

27
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
Oh, no. I learned never toborrow money from friends.

28
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
That's why Richard Dreyfussand I don't speak anymore.

29
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
Hey, how about this?Wanna be an extra on my show?

30
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
You could do that?

31
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
The pay's pretty good, and youcould do it for as long as you need.

32
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna be on TV!- Okay, now...

33
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
I gotta tell you, being on TV isn'tas glamorous and exciting as you think.

34
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
- Really?- No, it is awesome.

35
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
Hey, guys.

36
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
Why are you all dressed up?

37
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
We're bringing Emma to Ralph Laurentoday to introduce her to everyone.

38
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
- Doesn't she look cute?- She sure does.

39
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
Why does she have a pink bowtaped to her head?

40
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Because if one more person says,"What a cute little boy"...

41
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
...I'm gonna whip themwith a car antenna.

42
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
I think she's gonna bethe hit of the office.

43
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
Yeah, she's gonna be hotterthan peasant blouses and A-line skirts.

44
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
Can I get a blue bow?

45
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
Okay. I have looked througha bunch of career guides...

46
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
...photocopied and highlightedkey passages...

47
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
...and put them into alphabetical folders,so you can make an informed decision.

48
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
How long was I in there?

49
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
Okay, let's start with the A's.Advertising.

50
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.

51
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
Don't you wanna look through the rest?

52
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
I don't think I have to hear the rest.Advertising makes perfect sense.

53
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
Sorry you had to waste all this time.

54
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
You call eight hours alonewith my label maker wasted time?

55
00:02:59 --> 00:03:00
Now I'll get to use my shredder!

56
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
I mean, I could write slogans.How hard could it be, right?

57
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
"Cheese. It's milk that you chew."

58
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
"Crackers. Because your cheeseneeds a buddy."

59
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
"A grape. Because who can geta watermelon in your mouth?"

60
00:03:20 --> 00:03:20
I got one.

61
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
"Socks. Because your family's feetdeserve the best."

62
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
Honey, leave it to the pros.

63
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
I actually know someone in advertising.

64
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
I grew up with a guy who isa vice president at a big agency.

65
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
Maybe I can get him to meet you.Give me the phone.

66
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
"The phone. Bringing you closerto people who have phones."

67
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."

68
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
That went well. Almost everybodyknew that she was a girl.

69
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
Yeah, after you punched that one guywho got it wrong, word spread.

70
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
I'm just gonna go in my officeand pick up some stuff.

71
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
- Who the hell are you?- Who the hell are you?

72
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
I'm the hell personwhose office this is.

73
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Good one, Rach.

74
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
I'm Gavin Mitchell,the person who's taking over your job.

75
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
Excuse me?

76
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
Your baby's so cute.

77
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
But why would you puta pink bow on a boy?

78
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18
Hey, Joey. Look at me.

79
00:04:18 --> 00:04:19
I'm a nurse.

80
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
Yes, you are.

81
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
I think it might be timefor my sponge bath.

82
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
Sorry, I'm just so usedto hitting on the extras.

83
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
- So are you excited about your scene?- Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.

84
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
Relax. Don't be. They'll probablyjust make you stand in the background.

85
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
- Good.- You. Here, come here. Here.

86
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
Take this tray, stand on this yellow mark.You're gonna move on "action."

87
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
Walk over to the operating table, stop onthe blue mark and put the tray down.

88
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Don't walk too fast.

89
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
But don't dawdle.

90
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
Okay. Now, what?

91
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
And, action!

92
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
Cut! Cut.

93
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
- I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.- Well, don't be.

94
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
Okay, that helps.

95
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
And, action!

96
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
Cut!

97
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
Don't worry about it, Pheebs.It usually takes me three takes too.

98
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
All right, eight.

99
00:05:12 --> 00:05:17
And, action!

100
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
So do you have any otherquestions about advertising?

101
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
No. But let me show you what I can do.

102
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
"Bagels and doughnuts.

103
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
Round food for every mood."

104
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Monica warned me you might do that.

105
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
I think we might have somethingfor you at the agency.

106
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
- Really? That's great.- It's an unpaid internship.

107
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"it sounded like you said "unpaid."

108
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
Come on, now. Monica has a good job.It's not like you have a family to support.

109
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
Actually, we're trying. I don't thinkMonica is gonna want to postpone it.

110
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
We're supposed to have sex tonight.

111
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
Actually, she's probably at home,naked right now.

112
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
I tend to keep talkingtill somebody stops me.

113
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
- I can just picture her on the bed.- Stop!

114
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
Wait. What do you meanyou're taking over my job?

115
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
While you were on your baby vacation,I was doing your job.

116
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
A vacation? My ideaof a vacation does not involve...

117
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
...something sucking on my nipplesuntil they are raw.

118
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
Clearly, you've never beento Sandals Paradise Island.

119
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
All right. Don't get too comfortablethere, because I'm back in two weeks.

120
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
I want everything backthe way it was.

121
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
I can't say I care too much for the wayyou've rearranged my office.

122
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
I can't say I care too muchfor that smell you've brought in.

123
00:06:45 --> 00:06:50
- Excuse me?- Rach, we have a code brown situation.

124
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
Honey, could you pleasetake care of it for me?

125
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
All right, but you're gonnahave to do one sometime.

126
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
Let me just get this straight.

127
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
So I go have a baby, and they sendsome guy in to do my job?

128
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
Well, there was talk of shutting downRalph Lauren altogether.

129
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
Okay. Right.You're very cheeky for a temp.

130
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
I'm not a temp. I was transferred herefrom another department.

131
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
And what department was that?The jerk department?

132
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
They didn't tell meabout your quick wit.

133
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
Well, did they mention thatI'm rubber and you're glue?

134
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
- Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.- Hi, Mr. Zelner.

135
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.

136
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
When you left us, we weren't surewhat we were gonna do.

137
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
But then, Gavin to the rescue.Super Gavin.

138
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
Well, that's great.

139
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
So now, Super Gavin,when I come back...

140
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
...where do you plan on flying off to?

141
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
That's up to Mr. Zelner.I'm sure he'll make the right decision.

142
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
Super ass-kissing power.

143
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
Incidentally, when are you coming back?

144
00:07:45 --> 00:07:46
Today.

145
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
- You said two weeks.- No, I said today.

146
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
See, for a superhero,not so much with the listening.

147
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
So, what'd he say?

148
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
He can be a little rougharound the edges...

149
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
...so I'm gonna replace a wordhe used a lot with the word "puppy."

150
00:08:05 --> 00:08:09
So he said, "If your puppy frienddoesn't get her puppy act together...

151
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
...I am gonna fireher mother-puppy ass."

152
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
I'm sorry. I can't do this.I'm just not an actor.

153
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
That's right. You're not.You're a nurse.

154
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
- You're Nurse With Tray.- No, Joey...

155
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.She has no time for friends.

156
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
She gets in that operating roomand she carries that tray to the doctor...

157
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
...because if she doesn't, people die.

158
00:08:27 --> 00:08:28
Who dies?

159
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
Man With Eye Patch!

160
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
Now, you get in there,and you do your job.

161
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
Yes, doctor.

162
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
Okay, let's try this one more time.

163
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.Your tray is coming.

164
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
And, action.

165
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
Yes, I did it! I nailed it!

166
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
What's next?

167
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
The rest of the scene.

168
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
Okay, from the top, people.

169
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
Listen, sudden change of plans.My maternity leave just ended.

170
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
They said if I didn'tcome back today, they'd fire me.

171
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
What? No, that's illegal.

172
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
I'll have the Labor Departmenthere so fast, they won't...

173
00:09:11 --> 00:09:16
All right, calm down, Norma Rae.They didn't actually say that.

174
00:09:16 --> 00:09:20
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,this guy will try and squeeze me out.

175
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
But what about Emma?I mean, we don't have a nanny.

176
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
I know. We're just gonna haveto figure out a plan tonight.

177
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
Can you please just take careof her for today?

178
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,and we'll be on our way.

179
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
Come on.I don't know what else to do.

180
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
Fine. Fine.

181
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
We'll have fun, won't we?Yes, we will. Yes, we...

182
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
Ross.

183
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
You're pretty.

184
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna bestarting a new career from scratch.

185
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
It's gonna be a whilebefore I make a living at it.

186
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
Maybe now's not the right timeto be starting a family.

187
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
So you have to tell Monica you don'twant to have a baby right now?

188
00:10:06 --> 00:10:07
Yeah.

189
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Goodbye.

190
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
Okay, it's baby time.Pants off, Bing.

191
00:10:17 --> 00:10:18
Didn't see you there, Geller.

192
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
Ross is here, so...

193
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
And I was really hopingthat maybe I could hang out.

194
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
You know, what do you feel like doing?

195
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Well, we're gonna have sex.

196
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
I don't feel like having sex.

197
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
Maybe... I don't know. Maybe wecan watch a movie or something.

198
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
Let me put it this way:

199
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
We're having sexwhether you're here or not.

200
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
Pants off, Bing.

201
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
Now that I'm back, why don't you justfill me in on what you've been up to.

202
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
Well, I've changed your screen saverfrom that picture of *NS YNC.

203
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
Hey, they were popular when I left.

204
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
I'm working on thisbig presentation for tomorrow.

205
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
I should be involved in that,so get me up to speed.

206
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
That'll take weeks.Let me take care of the presentation.

207
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
No. I see what you'redoing here, all right?

208
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
This is my job, buddy. I've had it forfive years, and I know how it works.

209
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
- So why don't you just catch me up.- Fine.

210
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
Oh, God. You've totally messedwith the back support on my chair.

211
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
- How do you fix this?- You've been here five years.

212
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
- You figure it out.- Fine, I will.

213
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
All right, fill me in.

214
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
Do you have a blue tie that would gowith this? Emma spit up on mine.

215
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
Yeah, but you have to give it backif I get a job.

216
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
Of course, by that time,ties will be obsolete...

217
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
...and we'll all be wearingsilver jumpsuits.

218
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
Hey, good morning, lover.

219
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
I gotta say, after last night,I'm a little weak in the knees.

220
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
Here's an idea. You walk into a room,take a quick scan.

221
00:11:59 --> 00:12:00
Sorry.

222
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
But I kind of have this feeling thatwe may have made a baby last night.

223
00:12:04 --> 00:12:07
Oh, God, I have to tell you something.

224
00:12:08 --> 00:12:09
You're not pregnant.

225
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
What are you talking about?

226
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
Well, that thing that I have to doto make a baby?

227
00:12:14 --> 00:12:14
I faked it.

228
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
What? You faked it?

229
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
You know what?

230
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
I don't need a tie.

231
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
I mean, it's better open collar,you know?

232
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
It's more casual.

233
00:12:35 --> 00:12:37
Joey. Listen, I can't do this.It doesn't make any sense.

234
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
Yesterday I was a nurse,and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?

235
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
Sometimes we use the same extrasfor different parts. It's okay.

236
00:12:43 --> 00:12:47
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a verymemorable performance as the nurse.

237
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
And now, suddenly, I'm the waitress?That's gonna confuse my fans.

238
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
Well, maybe you are a nurse...

239
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
...but you moonlight as a waitress.

240
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
Because I'm a single mothersupporting my two children.

241
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
Nice.

242
00:13:08 --> 00:13:09
Wait a minute.

243
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at thesame hospital. Wouldn't I come say hi?

244
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
No. No, see, you and Drakeare having a fight.

245
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
About what?

246
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
He slept with youand then never called you.

247
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
And I just wanted a new daddyfor Davey and Becky.

248
00:13:26 --> 00:13:27
Okay. Okay, from the top.

249
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
And, action.

250
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
So I'm surprised you agreedto have lunch with me.

251
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
I'm surprised too. But yet, here I am.

252
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
Cut! Cut!

253
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
What are you doing?

254
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
I'm very angry at him because he sleptwith me and never called me back.

255
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
- Me too.- Me too!

256
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
Calm down. She means on the show.

257
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
We need some new extrasaround here.

258
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
Wow. You're here already.

259
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
Yes. Emma and I came in a little earlyto do research on the presentation.

260
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
Actually, I made a few changes.I think I'm caught up on everything.

261
00:14:01 --> 00:14:02
So ask me anything.

262
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
- How do you fix the chair?- Except that!

263
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
Hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all readyfor our presentation this afternoon.

264
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
- Good, because it's in 10 minutes.- What? I can't do that. I have the baby.

265
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
Ross is not gonna pick her upfor an hour.

266
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
Then Gavin can give the presentation.We have to do it now.

267
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
Ralph needs to leave early today.He's going helicopter shopping.

268
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
Well, there you go, you win.You win.

269
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
You get to do the presentation.You'll knock them dead.

270
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
No one will remember that I worked here,and then Ralph will buy his helicopter...

271
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
...and Super Gavin will just flyright alongside of him.

272
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
- You can do the presentation.- No, I can't. I have a baby.

273
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
I'll watch her.

274
00:14:43 --> 00:14:44
Why would you do that?

275
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
Because you worked really hard, andit's your job. And you're a little crazy.

276
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
That's really nice.

277
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
I should tell you that crying womenmake me very uncomfortable.

278
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
Well, you're not gonna likewhat's coming.

279
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

280
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
God.

281
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
Thank you. Thank you.

282
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
I'm really fine. Don't worry.I'm great with children.

283
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.

284
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Please don't fire my friend.Just let me talk to her.

285
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
- Okay, but this is her last chance.- Thank you.

286
00:15:30 --> 00:15:31
How about I do something for you?

287
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat,cover up the bald.

288
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
Listen, Pheebs. I was just talkingto the director...

289
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
...and he was thinking maybethis time you don't hit Drake.

290
00:15:42 --> 00:15:43
You just wait on the tables.

291
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
I can't do that. I'm an actor.I have a process.

292
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
You're a masseuse.You have a table with a hole in it.

293
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
Wait, I see what's happening here.You're threatened.

294
00:15:52 --> 00:15:53
What?

295
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
I'm so good in the scenethat I'm stealing focus from you.

296
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
Rise to the challenge, Tribbiani,because I just raised the bar.

297
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
Come join me up here.

298
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
Yeah, you can fire her, but I wouldcall security. She won't go easy.

299
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
You faked it?You couldn't have faked it.

300
00:16:11 --> 00:16:15
Yes, you can. You just makethe faces and the noises.

301
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
Guys can fake it?

302
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
Unbelievable.The one thing that's ours.

303
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
Why would you fake itwhen we're trying to have a baby?

304
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Well, that's actually why.

305
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
Look, I'm startinga whole new career now.

306
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
I'm not saying I don't want a baby.

307
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
I'm just saying maybewe could wait a little while.

308
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
Like a month?

309
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
- Or a year?- Really? You wanna wait a year?

310
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
It could be less than a year.I mean, you've heard my stuff.

311
00:16:41 --> 00:16:45
"Pants. Like shorts but longer."

312
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
Lt'll probably be more than a year.

313
00:16:52 --> 00:16:56
- I really wanna have a baby.- Well, yeah, me too.

314
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
Look, I'll just get my old job back.

315
00:17:01 --> 00:17:02
No, I want you to havea job that you love...

316
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
...not statistical analysisand data reconfiguration.

317
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
I quit, and you learn what I do?

318
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
I think there's never gonna bea right time to have a baby.

319
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
Now you're unemployed,and in a little while...

320
00:17:15 --> 00:17:18
...you'll find a new jobthat'll keep you really busy.

321
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
There's always gonna bea reason not to do this...

322
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
...but I think once the baby comes,we'll forget about all those reasons.

323
00:17:25 --> 00:17:26
I guess.

324
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
I mean, it's always gonna be scarywhen we have a baby.

325
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
It's gonna be really scary.

326
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
I mean, God, when we have a baby...

327
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
...there's gonna be so muchthat we're not able to control.

328
00:17:37 --> 00:17:40
I mean, the apartment'sgonna be a mess.

329
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
I won't have time to clean it.

330
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
What if the baby getsinto the ribbon drawer...

331
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
...and messes up all the ribbons?

332
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
What if there's no roomfor a ribbon drawer...

333
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
...because the baby's stufftakes up all the space?

334
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
Where will all the ribbons go?

335
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
Should we go make a babybefore you change your mind?

336
00:17:56 --> 00:17:57
- Yes, please!- Okay.

337
00:17:58 --> 00:18:00
And I promise I will notfake it this time.

338
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
Well, I wish I could say the same.I'm a little shook up.

339
00:18:07 --> 00:18:08
I know you botchedthat operation on purpose.

340
00:18:09 --> 00:18:12
I can't prove it yet, but when I do,you'll be going to jail for murder.

341
00:18:12 --> 00:18:13
I don't care if you are my brother.

342
00:18:14 --> 00:18:16
I'm not your brother.

343
00:18:16 --> 00:18:18
What about my children, Drake?

344
00:18:18 --> 00:18:19
No! No! No!

345
00:18:25 --> 00:18:26
