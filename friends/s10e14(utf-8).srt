1
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:04,725
Thank you guys for having us over.

2
00:00:04,887 --> 00:00:08,243
- Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
- I don't know why we don't hang out...

3
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:11,444
...with married couples more often.
- Because every time we do...

4
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:14,679
...you make jokes about swinging
and scare them away.

5
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:19,521
You mean that Portuguese couple?
Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.

6
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:24,001
Hey, you guys, I have great news.

7
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:29,042
- We're kind of in the middle of dinner.
- Oh, well, I already ate, but sure.

8
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:32,439
Guess what happened at work today.

9
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:35,081
A dinosaur died a million years ago?

10
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:39,075
Try 65 million years ago.
And then try:

11
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:45,396
My tenure review board met today,
and I hear it's looking really good.

12
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:48,685
Yeah, do you have any idea what this
means in academic circles?

13
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:51,042
I am gonna get laid.

14
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:55,083
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

15
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:56,521
Oh, Italian.

16
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:59,162
No one...
No one wanted seconds, right?

17
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:00,595
No, I'm good.

18
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:04,165
Guys, you're never gonna believe it.
This headhunter called me.

19
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:08,115
I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci.
Gucci wants me.

20
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:10,158
- I'm up for tenure.
- Congratulations.

21
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:13,125
You too. What are the odds?

22
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:14,760
Guess what?

23
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:18,718
I finally got that seed out of my teeth.

24
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,039
I don't know who I'm happiest for.

25
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:24,807
I do. He's been working on that all day.

26
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:19,276
Hey, Mon, was it weird
changing your name to Geller Bing?

27
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:23,042
No. No, it felt nice to acknowledge this.

28
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,602
- Where'd you go to do it?
- The...

29
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:28,520
The Ministry of Names...

30
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,235
...Bureau.

31
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:33,446
You never did it.

32
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,842
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of...

33
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:38,646
Of being an official Bing.

34
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,595
Hey, I will have you know that...

35
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:46,680
Who am I kidding? Let's call the kid
Geller and let Bing die with me.

36
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,275
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

37
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,677
Honey, would you want me to
take your name?

38
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:54,964
Oh, it's up to you. It's your name.
You've gotta live with it.

39
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,681
- Let's see. Call me Mrs. Hannigan.
- Mrs. Hannigan?

40
00:02:57,847 --> 00:03:00,645
Can't you see I'm
in the middle of something?

41
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,246
I like it.

42
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:06,324
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Joe.

43
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:09,365
We got things to check out
at the new house. You want to come?

44
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,280
- No, thank you.
- You're not happy about us moving...

45
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,836
...but you're the only one
who hasn't seen the house.

46
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:17,123
Yeah, come with us.
You'll see how close it is.

47
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:20,046
No, it's not close.
You said it was in escrow.

48
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,277
I couldn't even find that on the map.

49
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:29,043
Joey, please come.
It would mean so much to us.

50
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,805
You know what? You are my friends.
I want to be supportive.

51
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:35,320
I will come with you.
Shotgun.

52
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:36,801
Damn it.

53
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:39,078
See you guys later.
We'll pick you up at 11.

54
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:41,203
- So glad you're coming.
- All right.

55
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:45,517
- Good for you. That was really mature.
- What? The only reason I'm going...

56
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:48,838
...to their stupid house is to point
out everything wrong with it...

57
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:51,567
...so they don't move.
I'm gonna make them stay here.

58
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,281
You're a strange kind of grownup.

59
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:59,044
Joey, you can't make someone do
something they don't want to do.

60
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:04,201
Believe me. There's something I've been
trying to get Mike to do in bed, and...

61
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:08,440
- Can we not talk about that now?
- All right. Prude.

62
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,402
Look, Monica and Chandler
really love this house.

63
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,762
You are not gonna talk them
into staying here.

64
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:17,521
Hey, I can convince people
to do anything, you know?

65
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:20,724
I bet I could even get Mike
to do that thing. What is it?

66
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,286
I am not gonna help you do that!

67
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:28,403
Oh, my God.

68
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,400
Hi. I'm here to see Mr. Campbell,
with Gucci.

69
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,525
The reservation's probably under Gucci.

70
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:44,605
It's spelled like "gucky,"
which can be confusing.

71
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:49,236
Mr. Campbell's not here yet.
Let me show you to his table.

72
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,759
Oh, my God. That's my boss.
You have to seat us somewhere else.

73
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:58,037
I'm sorry, that's always
Mr. Campbell's table.

74
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:02,041
But my boss cannot see me.
I'm interviewing for another job.

75
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:04,238
I know. With "gucky."

76
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:10,481
- Rachel?
- I'm on a date.

77
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:12,878
That's great.

78
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,477
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough.
Single mom. Career.

79
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:19,161
You gotta get out there.

80
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:22,757
Well, you've got a good energy.

81
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:24,201
- Rachel?
- Yes, hi.

82
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,766
- James Campbell.
- Hi.

83
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,395
- Excuse us.
- Please.

84
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:32,444
He's cute.

85
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:34,755
So...

86
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:37,236
...your resume is quite impressive.

87
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,319
My resume?

88
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:46,641
I wouldn't... I wouldn't call
my online dating profile a resume.

89
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,044
Dating profile? No, I'm...
I'm talking about the work resume.

90
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:57,117
Whatever happened to just singing
for no reason?

91
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,927
Maybe people found it weird.

92
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,365
So...

93
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,720
- Why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
- What?

94
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:09,479
- I don't.
- You don't?

95
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:11,444
No, I love... I love it there.

96
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:14,639
Well, if you don't want to leave,
why are we having this lunch?

97
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:18,919
What?

98
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,120
That's Hugo Boss?

99
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:33,199
This place is so depressing.
If I had to work here, I'd kill myself.

100
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:38,517
But you obviously haven't.

101
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:42,606
- How can I help you?
- I need to change my name, please.

102
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:46,282
See, I need to change it
because I'm hiding from the law.

103
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,165
You're fun.

104
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,279
- You need to fill out this form.
- Okay. Well, just so I know...

105
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,677
I don't know how it works.
My name is Buffay...

106
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,565
...and my husband's name is Hannigan.

107
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:00,639
So is it supposed to be
"Buffay-Hannigan" or "Hannigan-Buffay"?

108
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:03,315
- It can be anything you want.
- Well, not anything.

109
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:05,762
Yeah. Anything.

110
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,646
Oh, this could take a while.

111
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:13,362
- Get out of my line.
- Okay.

112
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:18,960
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

113
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:21,641
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.

114
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:25,203
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan.
- Wrong again.

115
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:28,998
Apparently, you can change it
to anything.

116
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:32,079
So I thought, "All right, here's an
opportunity to be creative."

117
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:35,842
So meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

118
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:44,284
That's what we were
gonna name the baby.

119
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:50,197
- Phoebe.
- Princess Consuela.

120
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,962
You seriously changed
your name to that?

121
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:56,164
Okay, so from now on, we have to call
you Princess Consuela?

122
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,359
No, I'm gonna have my friends
call me Valerie.

123
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,558
- Hey, how did the interview go?
- Not good.

124
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:10,640
I always feel that way after an interview.
I'll bet it went better than you think.

125
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:15,483
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci
and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.

126
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:17,803
That is a bad interview.

127
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:20,362
What are you talking about?
How did this happen?

128
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:24,315
My boss was at the same restaurant
where I was having my interview...

129
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:25,886
...and he heard everything.

130
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,722
Later, he calls me into his office
and tells me he'll have to let me go...

131
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:31,445
...because I'm not a team player.

132
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:33,484
And I said, "Wait a minute. Yes, I am."

133
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,042
And then I had to sit there
for 45 minutes...

134
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:40,598
...while he proved that
that, in fact, was true.

135
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,405
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

136
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:46,161
Hey.

137
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:49,319
What...? What's this?

138
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,321
Why, it's a bottle of champagne.
Why is this here?

139
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,199
- Ross.
- I guess it's here...

140
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,880
...because I got tenure!

141
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,839
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

142
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:02,164
This is the single greatest day
of my professional career.

143
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,358
- Gunther. Six glasses.
- Six?

144
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:07,923
- You want me to join you?
- I thought Joey was here. Five is good.

145
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:14,365
Wow, I'm gonna have a loogey
in my coffee tomorrow.

146
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,757
Israeli champagne.

147
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:20,043
And it's vanilla.

148
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,167
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery.

149
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,401
Hey, Rach, so how did your thing go?

150
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,405
Good. But I won't hear about that
for a couple days.

151
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,604
Oh, you know what,
you're gonna get it. I can feel it.

152
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,365
Can you?

153
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:36,724
All right, everybody, here's to Ross.

154
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:41,199
And to years of hard work
finally paying off.

155
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:45,155
And to knowing that your career
doesn't mean everything.

156
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:49,037
But also knowing it means a lot.

157
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,567
But more importantly, to full,
well-rounded lives.

158
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,405
That center around work.

159
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,518
- To Ross.
- To Ross.

160
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:03,719
You know what the best part
about this is? I can never be fired.

161
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,246
- Oh, God.
- No, seriously.

162
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:07,642
I have job security for life.

163
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,082
You know?
I mean, I never have to worry.

164
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:13,484
Oh, look at you.
Look how happy you are for me.

165
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,159
No, it's not that. I got fired today.

166
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,477
And I didn't get the other job.

167
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:27,515
Rach, I'm so sorry.

168
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:31,282
- Great, I feel like an idiot.
- No, it's okay. You didn't know.

169
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,885
Little heads-up would've been nice.

170
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:45,757
Thank you for letting us see
the house again.

171
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,356
And thank you for explaining
to us what escrow means.

172
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:51,439
I've already forgotten what you said,
but thank you.

173
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:54,559
Take as long as you want.
Just let me know when you're through.

174
00:10:57,207 --> 00:11:00,358
- So glad you decided to come.
- Me, too. Yeah, this place is great.

175
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:05,043
So happy for you guys. Although,
you know, I hope you like fungus.

176
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:07,760
- What?
- Fungus.

177
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:09,645
Yeah. Place is full of it.

178
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,244
No, it's not. We had an inspection
and they didn't find anything.

179
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:16,837
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes
and a scratchy throat for no reason.

180
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:20,005
Maybe it's because you hung your head
out the window like a dog...

181
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,123
...the whole ride here.

182
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:24,845
Maybe.

183
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:28,676
So this is the living room, huh?
It's pretty dark.

184
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:34,637
- No, it's not.
- Are you kidding?

185
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:37,281
I think I just saw a bat
in the corner.

186
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:42,079
When your head was hanging out the
window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?

187
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:44,595
Maybe.

188
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:49,004
Look, I just think you guys can
do better than this house, you know?

189
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,044
Or any other house for that matter.

190
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,435
Oh, Joey.

191
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:55,075
We know you're having a hard
time with this, but we...

192
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,886
- We love it here.
- Fine! If you love this house so much...

193
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:02,006
...you should live here. Okay? I hope you
get used to that weird humming sound.

194
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,281
- Joey, we know that's you.
- No...

195
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:08,244
...it's not.

196
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:15,445
- Welcome back.
- I missed you.

197
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:17,325
- Oh, me too.
- So, what's new?

198
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,882
Well, I am no longer Phoebe Buffay.

199
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,442
- That's great. You changed your name?
- Yes, I did.

200
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:26,526
Meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

201
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,038
- You're kidding, right?
- Nope.

202
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:32,158
- You really did that?
- Yep.

203
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,397
You can't do that.

204
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,841
Why?

205
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:39,204
Why? It's fun. It's different.
No one else has a name like it.

206
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,359
Then I'm gonna change my name.

207
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,643
Great. Okay, what are
you gonna change it to?

208
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:46,640
Crap Bag.

209
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:51,723
- Mike Crap Bag?
- No. No "Mike." No, just "Crap Bag."

210
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:54,799
First name: Crap. Last name: Bag.

211
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,483
- You're not serious, right?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

212
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,719
It's fun, it's different,
and no one else has a name like that.

213
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,683
Well, then great.
If you love it, I love it.

214
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:07,685
I do love it. And I love your name.
I love Princess Consuela.

215
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:10,122
And I love Crap.

216
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:21,845
- Who are you?
- Oh, hi. I'm Joey.

217
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:24,805
My stupid friends are buying
this house. Who are you?

218
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:28,682
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are
selling this house.

219
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:32,439
I hate my parents.

220
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,842
I hate my friends.

221
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:40,763
Look, there's gotta be a way
that we can stop this from happening.

222
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,446
Like what?

223
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:48,201
Okay, you come with me and you
tell them that the house is haunted.

224
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,398
What are you, 8?

225
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:56,717
- Okay. Let's hear your great idea.
- I don't have any great ideas.

226
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:59,037
I am 8.

227
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,163
There's gotta be a way.
I mean, you know...

228
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:06,524
...if Monica and Chandler move here,
and Phoebe's married to Mike...

229
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:10,236
...that just leaves me and Ross
and Rach. You know what I mean?

230
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,206
I really don't.

231
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:16,519
What am I gonna do?
I feel like I'm losing my friends.

232
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,844
- My parents say I'll make new friends.
- Yeah, sure, easy for you.

233
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,646
You're young.
Me? I'm set in my ways.

234
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:28,116
This is what my mom was talking about.
Whiners are wieners.

235
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:34,240
Look, you want your friends
to be happy, right?

236
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,841
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

237
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:42,120
Well, if moving here is gonna make them
happy, don't you want them to do it?

238
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:45,167
Yeah. Maybe.

239
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,078
Then you've gotta let them go.

240
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:55,482
Oh, I hate to admit it, but you're...

241
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:57,922
You're probably right.

242
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:00,159
How'd you get to be so smart?

243
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,435
I read a lot.

244
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:06,277
Just when I thought we could be friends.

245
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:13,005
Oh, hey, Rach.
I just heard. I'm so sorry.

246
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:14,925
Oh, thank you...

247
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,882
You still don't know my name, do you?

248
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,644
Well, now I don't have to.

249
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:27,758
Ross, what is taking you so long?

250
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:39,279
I'm sorry. It's almost as if this wasn't
built for a quick getaway.

251
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:43,439
Rachel?

252
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:46,560
Mark? Oh, my God.

253
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:50,123
- How have you been?
- Fantastic. You remember Ross.

254
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:52,039
Sure. Sure.

255
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:53,880
What's with the chair?

256
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:59,881
You know, you can't always
get a seat on the subway, so...

257
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,845
Clever.

258
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,235
So how are you?

259
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,762
You're not catching me
on my best day.

260
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,839
Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff
doesn't say "big promotion."

261
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:13,522
No, but it's good. You know,
I'm gonna take some time off...

262
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,598
...and do charity work.
- Are you sure?

263
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,519
We may have something
at Louis Vuitton.

264
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,082
Screw charity work.
What do you got?

265
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,039
Why don't we have dinner and talk?

266
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,921
- Great. I'll call you.
- Okay.

267
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,681
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah. Yeah. I got tenure.

268
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:34,715
Oh, my God.

269
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:37,606
See? I told you something
good would come along.

270
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,565
And he seemed really nice.
I've met him before?

271
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:42,683
Ross, that's Mark.

272
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:46,601
From Bloomingdale's?
You were insanely jealous of him.

273
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,559
- That is Mark?
- Yes.

274
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,086
I hate that guy.

275
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,727
No, no, no.
You cannot go to dinner with him.

276
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:57,442
- What? You don't want me to get a job?
- Yeah, I'm sure he'll give you a job.

277
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:59,438
Maybe make you his "sex-cretary."

278
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,716
I'm serious.
I just don't trust that guy, okay?

279
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:06,118
You know what...? Okay, let's talk
about it later. There comes security.

280
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,039
Oh, I love this street.

281
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:23,837
The trees and the big front yards
and the actual picket fences.

282
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:26,561
Man, those two dogs are going at it.

283
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,358
- Hey. Where you been?
- Oh, just, you know, looking around.

284
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,006
But you know what?

285
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,317
This house is great.

286
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:39,199
Really? What changed your mind?

287
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:42,956
The little girl who lives here made me
feel better about the whole thing.

288
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:47,559
Joey? There was a little girl who lived
here, but she died, like, 30 years ago.

289
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:54,040
What?

290
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,237
I'm just messing with you.

291
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:01,676
That's not funny.
You know I'm afraid of little-girl ghosts.

292
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:05,284
Now that you're okay with the house,
do you want to go see your room?

293
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:07,235
What?

294
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:08,635
I get my own room?

295
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:12,644
You don't think we'd buy a house
and not have a Joey room, do you?

296
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,159
Oh, my God.

297
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:21,318
Hey, can I have an aquarium?
And a sex swing?

298
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:26,482
- No.
- Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.

299
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:31,238
After you, Ms. Bananahammock.

300
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:32,800
Thank you, Mr. Bag.

301
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,685
- Oh, hi, Rita.
- How are you?

302
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:38,838
Good. Oh, Rita's a massage client.

303
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,486
Yeah.

304
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:42,319
Why don't you introduce me?

305
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:46,997
Rita, this is my husband.

306
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,797
Why don't you tell her my name?

307
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:55,077
Okay, I will. This is...
This is my husband, Crap Bag.

308
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,155
Crap Bag?

309
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:02,246
If you need an easy way to remember it,
just think of a bag of crap.

310
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:08,317
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

311
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:14,206
Okay, fine, you made your point. Can
you please just be Mike Hannigan again?

312
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:15,886
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.

313
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:20,240
How about...?
How about Buffay-Hannigan?

314
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:21,396
Really?

315
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:25,196
Yeah. I'm Phoebe
Buffay-Hannigan-Bananahammock.

316
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,243
Do you even know what
a banana hammock is?

317
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:31,160
It's a funny word.

318
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,005
It's a Speedo.

319
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,525
Oh, crap.

320
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:44,721
- Hey, is Rachel here?
- Nope.

321
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:46,479
She's still at dinner?

322
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,996
- I guess. Why, who's she with?
- That guy, Mark...

323
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,159
...from Bloomingdale's.
She thinks he's just being nice to her.

324
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:54,363
But I know he really wants
to sleep with her.

325
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:57,206
It's seven years ago.

326
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:00,641
My time machine works.

327
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,482
We ran into him on the street today,
and he said he might have a job for her.

328
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:08,241
But I know he just wants
to get into her pants.

329
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:12,766
So, what if he wants to sleep with her?
I mean, she's single, and he's cute.

330
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:14,640
Excuse me?

331
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,400
Oh, please.

332
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,001
Yesterday, on the subway,
you couldn't stop staring...

333
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,919
...at that woman with the big breasts.

334
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:23,641
For your information,
I was staring at her baby.

335
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,763
We're about to be parents.

336
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:28,438
Oh, sorry.

337
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,925
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi. So...

338
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,477
...how was dinner?
- Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.

339
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:48,276
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I wonder why? What
could that smarmy letch possibly want?

340
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:53,567
Oh, Ross. Come on. He is happily
married. His wife just had twins.

341
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,759
Should we send something?

342
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,719
How did the job stuff go?

343
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,200
He offered me one.

344
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,438
- That's great.
- Congratulations.

345
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:06,404
I know, it's amazing.

346
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:10,361
It's amazing. It's so much better
than what I had at Ralph Lauren.

347
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,836
- The money is great.
- Can we...?

348
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:17,319
Can we just stop for a second? Who said
something better would come along?

349
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:20,684
You didn't believe me. I told
you everything was gonna work out.

350
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:23,879
You know what?
This calls for a bottle of Israel's finest.

351
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:30,327
The job is in Paris.

352
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:45,645
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig...

353
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,559
...but am I missing opportunities?

354
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,486
You know, I've always thought
of myself as a serious actor.

355
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:53,320
Should I be trying
to do more independent movies?

356
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:55,438
I don't know.

357
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,206
But you know what?
I'm gonna put you on with my bear.

358
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,358
Hold on.

359
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:05,244
Hey, Bailey, I need some career advice.
