1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:04
Phoebe. Look at that guyby the window. Wow!

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
He's awfully short.And I think he's talking to himself.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
And to be completely honest,he's not that good in bed.

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:15
What is wrong with me lately?It's like, every guy I see.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
That guy, for example.

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
That's not someoneI would be attracted to.

7
00:00:19 --> 00:00:25
But right now, all I want to do is ripoff his sweatpants and fanny pack.

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
Wait! This is about the fourth monthof your pregnancy.

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
This is normal.Your hormones start going crazy.

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
- Really? This has happened to you?- Absolutely!

11
00:00:35 --> 00:00:36
And I was carrying triplets.

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
So in medical terms,I was thrice as randy.

13
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
This explains so much!

14
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
Last weekend, I went from storeto store, sitting on Santas' laps.

15
00:00:47 --> 00:00:52
Yeah, I remember trying to steal acardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield.

16
00:00:53 --> 00:00:58
I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow. Maybeshe can give me a pill or something.

17
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
Yeah, that's what you need.A good pill.

18
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03

21
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
- I got our pictures developed.- Great.

22
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
Want to see pictures of us skating?

23
00:01:39 --> 00:01:44
Ordinarily, I would love to,but I am just swamped right now.

24
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
Where are the onesthat pretzel vendor took of us?

25
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
Oh, yeah.Probably at the end.

26
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
Oh, my God! All he took were picturesof my breasts.

27
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
I'm missing picture time!

28
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
You know, she has a face, Ross.

29
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
- Okay, here's a good one of us.- That is a good one!

30
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
It looks like a holiday card.With the tree...

31
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
...and the skaters and the snow.

32
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
I want to send out cards,but I never do.

33
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
Do you wantto send this one out together?

34
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
Together? Like, to people?

35
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
Yeah. "Happy Holidays, from Monaand Ross. " lt'll be cute, okay?

36
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
Okay.

37
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
I gotta go to work. Call me later?

38
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
- Bye, guys.- Bye.

39
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
Congratulations! You just got married!

40
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
Can you believe that?

41
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
What's the big dealabout a holiday card?

42
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
Married couples and familiessend out cards.

43
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
People who just started datingdon't send out cards. Is she crazy?

44
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
That's your wife you're talking about!

45
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
Bing!And the Bingette!

46
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
- You remember my boss, Doug.- Yes. Hi.

47
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
Good news! The divorce is final.I signed the papers this a.m.

48
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
You and Kara divorced?I'm sorry.

49
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
Sorry? I finally chewed my leg outof that bear trap.

50
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
- Congratulations to you guys.- No leg-chewing for us.

51
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
Well, give it time.

52
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
The divorce, the marriage,we got a lot to celebrate.

53
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
We should all go outto dinner tomorrow.

54
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
I can't thinkof anything we're doing.

55
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
Why can't I think of anything?

56
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
Tomorrow.I'll be out of court by 6.

57
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
They keep throwing sexual harassmentcases at me, and I knock them out!

58
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
Okay, see you tomorrow.

59
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
We're not seeing him tomorrow. I can'tspend another evening with that man.

60
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
Remember how he behavedat our wedding?

61
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
Because he wasn't invited.

62
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
He misbehavedat our engagement party.

63
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right throughan ice sculpture, doesn't it?

64
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
Hi! I went by the photo shop.Take a look.

65
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
Here is a mockup of our card.What do you think?

66
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Looks great.

67
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
Do you think it should say,"Love, Ross and Mona"?

68
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
Well, we haven't said thatto each other yet...

69
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
...but I guess it's okayto say it to others.

70
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
- How many did you want? I'll get 100.- A hundred?

71
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Well, I guess I'll take...

72
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
Mona?

73
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
I'm not sureabout the whole card thing.

74
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
Really? Why not?

75
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
Sending out a holiday card together?

76
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
I just don't knowif we're really quite there yet.

77
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
I didn't think of it that way.You're right.

78
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
- Can I ask you something?- Yes.

79
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
Where are we?

80
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
You know, where are we?Where is this relationship going?

81
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
I love spending time with you.I just hope we're moving forward.

82
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
We should talk about that,don't you think?

83
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
Let's do the card!

84
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
- What?- The card! I think we're there!

85
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
Okay. But I still thinkwe should have this talk.

86
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
Really?

87
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
Even with the card?

88
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
Dr. Long can't be here today,so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.

89
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
Okay.Can I ask you a question?

90
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
Was it me, or was the guywho took my blood sample really cute?

91
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
You know who I'm talking about?Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?

92
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
- Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.- Yes, you are.

93
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
So, how's it going?

94
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
Really, really good.But enough about me! Come on.

95
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
Where are you from?What do you do?

96
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
- I'm a doctor.- Right. I meant...

97
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
...in your spare time.Do you cook? Ski?

98
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
Or hang out with your wife,or girlfriend?

99
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
I have no wife or girlfriend,but I do ski.

100
00:06:05 --> 00:06:08
I love to ski!How amazing is this?

101
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
- Are you experiencing any discomfort?- No, I'm very comfortable.

102
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
- Any painful gas?- No!

103
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
Dr. Schiff!What kind of question is that?

104
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
Would you liketo lie down on the table?

105
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
Would you like meto lie down on the table?

106
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
- Is there something going on here?- Do you feel it too?

107
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
- Hi.- How did your doctor's appointment go?

108
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
Let's see,they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.

109
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
In the middle of the exam,I put my pinkie in his dimple.

110
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
- Oh, my God!- Why did you do that?

111
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Remember my problem duringmy fourth month of pregnancy?

112
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
Oh, yeah!The Evander Holyfield phase.

113
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
Man! You were so hard up,you practically came on to me.

114
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
You wish.

115
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
I could have had youif I wanted you.

116
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.

117
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Okay, even this is turning me on.

118
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
Ross! How's it goingwith you and Mona?

119
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
Are you guys still together?

120
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
Yeah, we're moving forward.You'll be getting our card.

121
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
You're doing a holiday card?

122
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
Not just a card. She wants to talkabout where the relationship is going.

123
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
Women!

124
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
I know! Why do you guys needto have this conversation?

125
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
No man would ask a woman,"So where is this going?"

126
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
Ross, you asked me that.

127
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
You were a closed book, okay?I'm not a mind reader!

128
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
Besides, I hate those conversations.I'm horrible at them. Really.

129
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
Maybe I need some kind of a gesture...

130
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
...that says we're moving forwardwithout talking.

131
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
Like asking herto move in with you?

132
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
Smaller than that.

133
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
- Making her a mix tape?- Bigger than that.

134
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
- Give her a key to your apartment.- We were closer with the mix tape.

135
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
Have you said, "I love you"?

136
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
I don't think I'm quite there yet.

137
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
But I could say,"I love spending time with you."

138
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
- We hate that.- It's a slap in the face.

139
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
Forget it. You know what?I'll just have the conversation.

140
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
I'll just say I like things the waythey are, and hope for the best.

141
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
What do you think, Rach?

142
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
I think if it wasa little colder in here...

143
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
...I could see your nipplesthrough that sweater.

144
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.

145
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
We can't do it. Monica has to work.

146
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
My ex-wife didn't work.

147
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
Unless you call turninginto her mother "work."

148
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
Fine. Tomorrow night then.

149
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
- Tomorrow's no good for her, either.- Why not?

150
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
It's the semifinals...

151
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
...of her bocce ball tournament.

152
00:08:49 --> 00:08:54
What's going on, Bing? Does your wifehave a problem with me or something?

153
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
Well, now you're just talking crazy.

154
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
Then why can't we all go out together?

155
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
Because we split up.

156
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
Monica and I split up.

157
00:09:04 --> 00:09:05
Hold me.

158
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
Good God, Bing. Well, I can't sayI'm altogether surprised.

159
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
I saw the way she looked at you,and there was no love there.

160
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
And the way she looked at me,pure lust.

161
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
What would really help me throughthis tough time is choking someone.

162
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
Bing, my boy,we're gonna get you over this.

163
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
Here's the plan:We're going to a strip club!

164
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
Oh, no!Monica would freak.

165
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
But to hell with that bitch!

166
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
Here we go.

167
00:09:38 --> 00:09:44
Mona, it's time we had a conversationabout where things are with us.

168
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
Yeah, I think I suggested that.

169
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
We are so...

170
00:09:53 --> 00:09:58
Well, I really like you.And I love hanging out with you.

171
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
And I'm having a lot of fun.

172
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
Okay.

173
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
There's no point in spending timewith someone if it's just fun.

174
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
It's gotta be going somewhere, right?

175
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
So where is it going?

176
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
That's the real question.

177
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
And the answer is...

178
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
...it's going somewhere...

179
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
...fun.

180
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
I know what you're thinking.Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.

181
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
But you're not getting any younger.

182
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
No! I mean, not you.Not you.

183
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
You are getting younger!

184
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
You're getting younger by the second.What's your secret?

185
00:10:53 --> 00:10:58
- I'm sorry, so where are we?- Well, to sum up...

186
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
...we're having fun.You look young.

187
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
- Okay...- But that's not enough.

188
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
So...

189
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
...here's a key to my apartment.

190
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
- Really?- Really.

191
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
You don't think this is too fast?

192
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
You gave her a keyto your apartment?

193
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
Not just a key.I gave her the only key!

194
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
I am now a homeless personin a very serious relationship!

195
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
- Ross, how did the conversation go?- Great. I live on the street.

196
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
Where?

197
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
- Hi.- Okay, Monica, Rachel...

198
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
...this is my friend Roger.- Hi, Roger.

199
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
I'll get us some drinks.Could you help me?

200
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
Yeah, okay.

201
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
He's here to have sex with you.

202
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
- What?- You're welcome.

203
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
- Phoebe, no!- It's okay. He's a virgin.

204
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
Rachel, I was talking to this guy.I think he'll have sex with you.

205
00:12:23 --> 00:12:24
Let's leave them alone.

206
00:12:24 --> 00:12:29
No! I don't care what my hormones aredoing! I won't do it with some guy!

207
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
Fine! Then you tell Roger, becausehe was really looking forward to this!

208
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
Bing! Look at those twin sistersdancing together.

209
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
Let me buy you a lap dancewith those girls.

210
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
That's all right, sir.And that's just one girl.

211
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
- Bing, what's this?- It's a hand.

212
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
You use it as a drink holder.

213
00:13:02 --> 00:13:06
It's a wedding ring. Get rid of it.We'll throw it in the East River!

214
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
- No!- Yes!

215
00:13:07 --> 00:13:12
I did it, and I felt a lot better! Youmight even hit a seagull in the head.

216
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
Okay. I'm gonna need a bunchof extra keys.

217
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
Apparently, I give them awayfor no reason at all.

218
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
Ross, what's going on?You're changing the lock?

219
00:13:24 --> 00:13:25
No.

220
00:13:25 --> 00:13:26
That guy is.

221
00:13:27 --> 00:13:31
You give me a key to your apartment,and then you change the lock?

222
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
Good luck, buddy.

223
00:13:35 --> 00:13:40
I thought we were moving forward. Nowyou're sending me these mixed signals.

224
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
What are you trying to tell me?

225
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
I'm trying to tell you...

226
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
...I made you a mix tape.

227
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
- What?- I love you.

228
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
And I love spending time with you.

229
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
- Hi, honey, I'm home.- From the tequila factory?

230
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
To avoid going to dinner with Doug,I told him you and I split up.

231
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
So he took meto these sleazy strip clubs.

232
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
When I wouldn't give him my weddingring, he threw a can at a bird.

233
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
Come here.I can breathe through my mouth.

234
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
- Sweetie.- You know what the worst part was?

235
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
I saw what my life would bewithout you.

236
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
It was like "It's a Wonderful Life"with lap dances.

237
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
Please promisethat you'll never leave me...

238
00:14:34 --> 00:14:38
...that we'll grow old together,and be with each other always.

239
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
I promise.

240
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
How about we send outa holiday card together this year?

241
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
I don't know if we're there yet.

242
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
I'd like to order a pizza.Can I ask you a question?

243
00:14:52 --> 00:14:57
Is the cute blond guy deliveringtonight? Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."

244
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
- I'll call you back.- Who was that?

245
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
- It's just the pizza place.- You hung up on the pizza place?

246
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
I don't hang up on your friends.

247
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
- Sorry, I'm just having a rough day.- What's wrong?

248
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
- You don't want to hear about it.- Then why did I ask?

249
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
Okay, this is embarrassing. Lately,with this whole pregnancy thing...

250
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
...I'm just finding myself...

251
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
How do I put this?

252
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
Erotically charged.

253
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
Is that college talk for "horny"?

254
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
Yeah. I have all of these feelings,and I don't know what to do.

255
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
I can't date a normal person.I don't need a relationship.

256
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
All I really want is one great night!Just sex.

257
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
No strings attached.No relationship.

258
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
With someone I feel comfortable with,and who knows what to do.

259
00:15:45 --> 00:15:50
For just one great night.I mean, is that really so hard...

260
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
...to find?

261
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
So how was your day?

262
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.

263
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
I gotta get up early,and it's almost 7:00.

264
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
- I gotta go to my room.- Good night!

265
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
Good night!

266
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
- I can't do it!- I didn't ask you to!

267
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
- You're Rachel! My friend!- You're Joey!

268
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
Plus, it would be wrong,and weird and bad!

269
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
So bad!But I didn't ask you to do anything!

270
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
I know!

271
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
- You wanna do it?- No!

272
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
- I'm just testing you!- No more of this talk!

273
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
- This talk never happened!- Good night!

274
00:16:41 --> 00:16:42
Good night!

275
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
Get back in there!

276
00:16:54 --> 00:16:58
Listen, I'm sorry aboutthat whole thing with Roger.

277
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
It really wasn't right.And I want to make it up to you.

278
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
So I brought you somethingI think you'll really enjoy.

279
00:17:10 --> 00:17:15
Now this is just a loan, okay?I'm gonna want him back.

280
00:17:16 --> 00:17:17
I'm gonna go now.

281
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
I'm sorry.I thought I could do it, and I can't.

282
00:17:28 --> 00:17:29
